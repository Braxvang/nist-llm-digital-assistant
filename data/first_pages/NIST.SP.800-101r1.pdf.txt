Executive Summary

    The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay abreast of the latest
    technologies that may be used to expose relevant clues in an investigation. Mobile devices are
    commonplace in today’s society, used by many individuals for both personal and professional
    purposes. Mobile devices vary in design and are continually undergoing change as existing
    technologies improve and new technologies are introduced. When a mobile device is
    encountered during an investigation, many questions arise: What is the best method to
    preserve the evidence? How should the device be handled? How should valuable or
    potentially relevant data contained on the device be extracted? The key to answering these
    questions begins with a firm understanding of the hardware and software characteristics of
    mobile devices. This guide discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination,
    analysis, and reporting of digital evidence. The issue of ever increasing backlogs for most
    digital forensics labs is addressed and guidance is provided on handling on-site triage
    casework.

    The objective of the guide is twofold: to help organizations evolve appropriate policies and
    procedures for dealing with mobile devices and to prepare forensic specialists to conduct
    forensically sound examinations involving mobile devices. This guide is not all-inclusive nor
    is it prescribing how law enforcement and incident response communities should handle
    mobile devices during their investigations or incidents. Specific vendors and mobile forensic
    acquisition guidance is not specified. However, from the principles outlined and other
    information provided, organizations should find this guide helpful in establishing their policies
    and procedures. This publication should not be construed as legal advice. Organizations should
    use this guide as a starting point for developing a forensic capability in conjunction with proper
    technical training and extensive guidance provided by legal advisors, officials, and
    management. This guide is the first revision to NIST SP800-101. While much of the
    information provided herein has been carried over from the original guide, the material has
    been updated and augmented to reflect the current state of the discipline.

1. Introduction

 1.1   Purpose and Scope

       This guide provides basic information on mobile forensics tools and the preservation,
       acquisition, examination and analysis, and reporting of digital evidence present on mobile
       devices. This information is relevant to law enforcement, incident response and other types of
       investigations. This guide focuses mainly on the characteristics of cellular mobile devices,
       including feature phones, smartphones, and tablets with cellular voice capabilities. It also
       covers provisions to be taken into consideration during the course of an incident investigation.

       This guide is intended to address common circumstances that may be encountered by
       organizational security staff and law enforcement investigators involving digital electronic data
       residing on mobile devices and associated electronic media. It is also intended to complement
       existing guidelines and delve more deeply into issues related to mobile devices and their
       examination and analysis.

       Procedures and techniques presented in this document are a compilation of best practices
       within the discipline and references have been taken from existing forensic guidelines. This
       publication is not to be used as a step-by-step guide for executing a proper forensic
       investigation when dealing with mobile devices nor construed as legal advice. Its purpose is to
       inform readers of the various technologies involved and potential ways to approach them from
       a forensic point of view. Readers are advised to apply the recommended practices only after
       consultation with management and legal officials for compliance with laws and regulations
       (i.e., local, state, federal, and international) that are applicable.

 1.2   Audience and Assumptions

       The intended audience is varied and ranges from forensic examiners to response team
       members handling a computer security incident to organizational security officials
       investigating an employee-related incident. The practices recommended in this guide are
       designed to highlight key technical principles associated with the handling and examination of
       mobile devices. Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of traditional digital
       forensic methodologies and capabilities involving stand-alone computers. Due to the changing
       nature of mobile devices and their related forensic procedures and tools, readers are expected
       to be aware of and employ additional resources for the most current information.

 1.3   Document Structure

       The guide is divided into the following chapters and appendices:

              Chapter 1 explains the authority, purpose and scope, audience and assumptions of the
               document and outlines its structure.

2. Background

       This chapter gives an overview of the hardware and software capabilities of mobile devices
       and their associated cellular networks. The overview provides a summary of general
       characteristics and, where useful, focuses on key features relevant to forensics. Developing an
       understanding of the components and organization of mobile devices (e.g., memory
       organization and its use) is a prerequisite to understanding the intricacies involved when
       dealing with them forensically. For example, mobile device memory that contains user data
       may be volatile (i.e., DRAM/SRAM) and require continuous power to maintain content
       similar to RAM in a personal computer. Similarly, features of cellular networks are an
       important aspect of mobile device forensics, since logs of usage, geographic location, and
       other data are maintained. Mobile device technologies and cellular networks are rapidly
       changing, with new technologies, products, and features being introduced regularly. Because
       of the fast pace with which mobile device technologies are evolving, this discussion captures a
       snapshot of the mobile device discipline at the present time.

 2.1   Mobile Device Characteristics

       Mobile devices perform an array of functions ranging from a simple telephony device to those
       of a personal computer. Designed for mobility, they are compact in size, battery-powered, and
       lightweight. Most mobile devices have a basic set of comparable features and capabilities.
       They house a microprocessor, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), a
       radio module, a digital signal processor, a microphone and speaker, a variety of hardware keys
       and interfaces and a liquid crystal display (LCD). The operating system (OS) of a mobile
       device may be stored in either NAND or NOR memory while code execution typically occurs
       in RAM.

       Currently, mobile devices are equipped with system-level microprocessors that reduce the
       number of supporting chips required and include considerable internal memory capacity
       currently up to 64GB (e.g., Stacked NAND). Built-in Secure Digital (SD) memory card slots,
       such as one for the micro Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (microSDXC), may support
       removable memory with capacities ranging from 64GB to 2TB of storage. Non-cellular
       wireless communications such as infrared (i.e., IrDA), Bluetooth, Near Field Communication
       (NFC), and WiFi may also be built into the device and support synchronization protocols to
       exchange other data (e.g., graphics, audio, and video file formats).

       Different mobile devices have different technical and physical characteristics (e.g., size,
       weight, processor speed, memory capacity). Mobile devices may also use different types of
       expansion capabilities to provide additional functionality. Furthermore, mobile device
       capabilities sometimes include those of other devices such as handheld Global Positioning
       Systems (GPS), cameras (still and video) or personal computers. Overall, mobile devices can
       be classified as feature phones that are primarily simple voice and messaging communication
       devices or smartphones that offer more advanced capabilities and services for multimedia,
       similar to those of a personal computer. Table 1 highlights the general hardware characteristics
       of feature and smartphone models, which underscore this diversity.

       The classification scheme is illustrative and intended to give a sense of the range of hardware
       characteristics currently in the marketplace. Over time, characteristics found in smartphones
       tend to appear in feature phones as new technology is introduced to smartphones. Though the

                                                  3

lines of delineation are somewhat fuzzy and dynamic, the classification scheme nevertheless
serves as a general guide.

Both feature phones and smartphones support voice, text messaging, and a set of basic
Personal Information Management (PIM) type applications including phonebook and calendar
facilities. Smartphones add PC-like capability for running a wide variety of general and
special-purpose applications. Smartphones are typically larger than feature phones, support
higher video resolutions (e.g., ~300 PPI) and may have an integrated QWERTY keyboard or
touch sensitive screen. Smartphones generally support a wide array of applications, available
through an application storefront. Table 2 lists the differences in software capabilities found on
these device classes.

      Feature phones typically use a closed operating system with no published documentation. A
      number of companies specializing in embedded software also offer real-time operating system
      solutions for manufacturers of mobile devices. Smartphones generally use either a proprietary
      or an open source operating system. Nearly all smartphones use one of the following operating
      systems: Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS, Symbian, WebOS or Windows Phone. Unlike the
      more limited kernels in feature phones, these operating systems are multi-tasking and full-
      featured, designed specifically to match the capabilities of high-end mobile devices. Many
      smartphone operating systems manufacturers offer a Software Development Kit (SDK) (e.g.,
      the Android1 or iOS2 SDKs).

2.2   Memory Considerations

      Mobile devices contain both non-volatile and volatile memory. Volatile memory (i.e., RAM)
      is used for dynamic storage and its contents are lost when power is drained from the mobile
      device. Non-volatile memory is persistent as its contents are not affected by loss of power or
      overwriting data upon reboot. For example, solid-state drives (SSD) that stores persistent data
      on solid-state flash memory.

      Mobile devices typically contain one or two different types of non-volatile flash memory.
      These types are NAND and NOR. NOR flash has faster read times, slower write times than
      NAND and is nearly immune to corruption and bad blocks while allowing random access to
      any memory location. NAND flash offers higher memory storage capacities, is less stable and
      only allows sequential access.

                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Memory configurations among mobile devices have evolved over time. Feature phones were
among the first types of devices that contained NOR flash and RAM memory. System and
user data are stored in NOR and copied to RAM upon booting for faster code execution and
access. This is known as the first generation of mobile device memory configurations.

As smartphones were introduced, memory configurations evolved, adding NAND flash
memory. This arrangement of NOR, NAND and RAM memory is referred to as the second
generation. This generation of memory configurations stores system files in NOR flash, user
files in NAND and RAM is used for code execution.

The latest smartphones contain only NAND and RAM memory (i.e., third generation), due to
requirements for higher transaction speed, greater storage density and lower cost. To facilitate
the lack of space on mobile device mainboards and the demand for higher density storage
space (i.e., 2GB – 128GB) the new Embedded MultiMedia Cards (eMMC) style chips are
present in many of today’s smartphones.

Figure 1 illustrates the various memory configurations contained across all mobile devices.




                              Figure 1: Memory Configurations

RAM is the most difficult to capture accurately due to its volatile nature. Since RAM is
typically used for program execution, information may be of value to the examiner (e.g.,
configuration files, passwords, etc.). Mobile device RAM capture tools are just beginning to
become available.

NOR flash memory includes system data such as: operating system code, the kernel, device
drivers, system libraries, memory for executing operating system applications and the storage
of user application execution instructions. NOR flash will be the best location for data
collection for first generation memory configuration devices.

NAND flash memory contains: PIM data, graphics, audio, video, and other user files. This
type of memory generally provides the examiner with the most useful information in most
cases. NAND flash memory may leave multiple copies of transaction-based files (e.g.,
databases and logs) due to wear leveling algorithms and garbage collection routines. Since
NAND flash memory cells can be re-used for only a limited amount of time before they
become unreliable, wear leveling algorithms are used to increase the life span of Flash memory
storage, by arranging data so that erasures and re-writes are distributed evenly across the SSD.


                                           6
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      Garbage collection occurs because NAND flash memory cannot overwrite existing data, the
      data must first be erased before writing to the same cell [Bel10].

2.3   Identity Module Characteristics

      Identity modules (commonly known as SIM cards) are synonymous with mobile devices that
      interoperate with GSM cellular networks. Under the GSM framework, a mobile device is
      referred to as a Mobile Station and is partitioned into two distinct components: the Universal
      Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and the Mobile Equipment (ME). A UICC, commonly
      referred to as an identity module (e.g., Subscriber Identity Module [SIM], Universal Subscriber
      Identity Module [USIM], CDMA Subscriber Identity Module [CSIM]), is a removable
      component that contains essential information about the subscriber. The ME and the radio
      handset portion cannot fully function without a UICC. The UICC’s main purpose entails
      authenticating the user of the mobile device to the network providing access to subscribed
      services. The UICC also offers storage for personal information, such as phonebook entries,
      text messages, last numbers dialed (LND) and service-related information.

      The UICC partitioning of a mobile device stipulated in the GSM standards has brought about a
      form of portability. Moving a UICC between compatible mobile devices automatically
      transfers the subscriber’s identity and some of the associated information (e.g., SMS messages
      and contacts) and capabilities. In contrast, 2G and 3G CDMA mobile devices generally do not
      contain a UICC card. Analogous UICC functionality is instead directly incorporated within the
      device. However, newer CDMA (i.e., 4G/LTE) devices may employ a CDMA Subscriber
      Identity Module (CSIM) application running on a UICC.

      A UICC can contain up to three applications: SIM, USIM and CSIM. UICCs used in GSM
      and UMTS mobile devices use the SIM and UMTS SIM (USIM) applications, while CDMA
      devices use the CSIM application. A UICC with all three applications provides users with
      additional portability through the removal of the UICC from one mobile device and insertion
      into another. Because the SIM application was originally synonymous with the physical card
      itself, the term SIM is often used to refer to the physical card in lieu of UICC. Similarly the
      terms USIM and CSIM can refer to both the physical card as well as the respective
      applications supported on the UICC.

      At its core, a UICC is a special type of smart card that typically contains a processor and
      between 16 to 128 KB of persistent electronically erasable, programmable read only memory
      (EEPROM). It also includes RAM for program execution and ROM for the operating system,
      user authentication and data encryption algorithms, and other applications. The UICC’s file
      system resides in persistent memory and stores data such as: as phonebook entries, text
      messages, last numbers dialed (LND) and service-related information. Depending on the
      mobile device used, some information managed by applications on the UICC may coexist in
      the memory of the mobile device. Information may also reside entirely in the memory of the
      mobile device instead of available memory reserved for it in the file system of the UICC.

      The UICC operating system controls access to elements of the file system [3GP07]. Actions
      such as reading or updating may be permitted or denied unconditionally, or allowed
      conditionally with certain access rights, depending on the application. Rights are assigned to a
      subscriber through 4-8 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) codes. PINs protect core
      subscriber-related data and certain optional data.


                                                 7
                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

A preset number of attempts (usually three) are allowed for providing the correct PIN code to
the UICC before further attempts are blocked completely, rendering communications
inoperative. Only by providing a correct PIN Unblocking Key (PUK) may the value of a PIN
and its counter be reset on the UICC. If the number of attempts to enter the correct PUK value
exceeds a set limit, normally ten, the card becomes blocked permanently. The PUK for a
UICC may be obtained from the service provider or network operator by providing the
identifier of the UICC (i.e., Integrated Circuit Chip Identifier or ICCID). The ICCID is
normally imprinted on the front of UICC, but may also be read from an element of the file
system.

UICCs are available in three different size formats. They are: Mini SIM (2FF), Micro SIM
(3FF), and Nano SIM (4FF). The Mini SIM with a width of 25 mm, a height of 15 mm, and a
thickness of .76 mm, is roughly the footprint of a postage stamp and is currently the most
common format used worldwide. Micro (12mm x 15mm x .76mm) and Nano (8.8mm x
12.3mm x .67mm) SIMs are found in newer mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 5 uses the 4FF).




                           Figure 2: SIM Card Size Formats [Orm09]

Though similar in dimension to a miniSD removable memory card, UICCs follow a different
set of specifications with vastly different characteristics. For example, their pin connectors are
not aligned along the bottom edge as with removable media cards, but instead form a contact
pad integral to the smart card chip, which is embedded in a plastic frame, as shown in Figure 2.
UICCs also employ a broad range of tamper resistance techniques to protect the information
they contain.

The slot for the UICC card is normally not accessible from the exterior of the mobile device to
protect insertion and removal as with a memory card. Instead, it typically is found beneath the
battery compartment. When a UICC is inserted into a mobile device handset and pin contact is
made, a serial interface is used for communicating between them.

In most cases, the UICC should be removed from the handset first and read using a Personal
Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader. Removal of the UICC provides the examiner with
ability to read additional data that may be recovered (e.g., deleted text messages).

Authenticating a device to a network securely is a vital function performed via the UICC.
Cryptographic key information and algorithms within the tamper resistant module provide the
means for the device to participate in a challenge-response dialogue with the network and
respond correctly, without exposing key material and other information that could be used to
clone the UICC and gain access to a subscriber’s services. Cryptographic key information in
the UICC also supports stream cipher encryption to protect against eavesdropping on the air
interface.

A UICC is similar to a mobile device as it has both volatile and non-volatile memory that may
contain the same general categories of data as found in a mobile device. It can be thought of as
a trusted sub-processor that interfaces to a device and draws power from it. The file system
resides in the non-volatile memory of a UICC and is organized as a hierarchical tree structure.

For example, the SIM applications file system is composed of three types of elements: the root
of the file system (MF), subordinate directory files (DF), and files containing elementary data
(EF). Figure 3 illustrates the structure of the file system. The EFs under DFGSM and DFDCS1800
contain mainly network related information for different frequency bands of operation. The
EFs under DFTELECOM contain service related information.




                              Figure 3: SIM File System (GSM)

Various types of digital evidence may exist in elementary data files scattered throughout the
file system and be recovered from a UICC. Some of the same information held in the UICC
may be maintained in the memory of the mobile device and encountered there as well. Besides
the standard files defined in the GSM specifications, a UICC may contain non-standard files
established by the network operator. Several general categories of data may be found in
standard elementary data files of a UICC are as follows:

       Service-related Information including unique identifiers for the UICC, the Integrated
        Circuit Card Identification (ICCID) and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity
        (IMSI)

       Phonebook and call information known respectively as the Abbreviated Dialing
        Numbers (ADN) and Last Numbers Dialed (LND)

       Messaging information including both Short Message Service (SMS) text messages
        and Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) simple multimedia messages

       The USIM application supports the storage of links to incoming (EFICI) and outgoing
        (EFOCI) calls. The EFICI and EFOCI are each stored using two bytes. The first byte

                   points to a specific phone book and the second points to an abbreviated dialing
                   number (EFADN) entry3

                  Location information including Location Area Information (LAI) for voice
                   communications and Routing Area Information (RAI) for data communications.

2.4   Cellular Network Characteristics

      Within the U.S., different types of digital cellular networks follow distinct incompatible sets of
      standards. The following sections discuss digital cellular networks, Mobile IP and satellite
      phones.

      The two most dominant types of digital cellular networks are known as Code Division
      Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks.
      Other common cellular networks include Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and
      Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). iDEN networks use a proprietary protocol
      designed by Motorola, while the others follow standardized open protocols. A digital version
      of the original analog standard for cellular telephone phone service, called Digital Advanced
      Mobile Phone Service (D-AMPS), also exists.

      CDMA refers to a technology designed by Qualcomm in the U.S., which employs spread
      spectrum communications for the radio link.4 Rather than sharing a channel as many other
      network air interfaces do, CDMA spreads the digitized data over the entire bandwidth
      available, distinguishing multiple calls through a unique sequence code assigned. Successive
      versions of the IS-95 standard define CDMA conventions in the U.S., which is the reason why
      the term CDMA is often used to refer to IS-95 compliant cellular networks. IS-95 CDMA
      systems are sometimes referred to as cdmaOne. The next evolutionary step for CDMA to 3G
      services was CDMA2000. CDMA2000 is backward compatible with its previous 2G iteration
      IS-95 (cdmaOne). The successor to CDMA2000 is Qualcomm’s Long Term Evolution (LTE).
      LTE adds faster data transfer capabilities for mobile devices and is commonly referred to as
      4G LTE. Verizon and Sprint are common CDMA network carriers in the U.S.

      GSM is a cellular system used worldwide that was designed in Europe, primarily by Ericsson
      and Nokia. AT&T and T-Mobile are common GSM network carriers in the U.S. GSM uses a
      TDMA air interface. TDMA refers to a digital link technology whereby multiple phones share
      a single carrier, radio frequency channel by taking turns – using the channel exclusively for an
      allocated time slice, then releasing it and waiting briefly while other phones use it. A packet
      switching enhancement to GSM called General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) was
      standardized to improve the transmission of data. The next generation of GSM, commonly
      referred to as the third generation or 3G, is known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications
      System (UMTS) and involves enhancing GSM networks with a Wideband CDMA (W-
      CDMA) air interface. 4G LTE is also available to GSM mobile devices providing higher data
      transmission rates to its customers.5

TDMA is also used to refer specifically to the standard covered by IS-136. Using the term
TDMA to refer to a general technique or a specific type of cellular network can be a source of
confusion. For example, although GSM uses a TDMA air interface (i.e., the general
technique), as does iDEN, neither of those systems is compatible with TDMA cellular
networks that follow IS-136. Many mobile forensic tools refer to these devices as
iDEN/TDMA phones. Mobile devices operating over the iDEN network often utilize a Push-
To-Talk (PTT) function provide subscribers with the ability to communicate with one another
over a cellular network in a “walkie-talkie” fashion.

Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN), a mobile telecommunications technology
developed by Motorola provided the benefits of a two-way radio system and a cellular
telephone. The iDEN project originally began as MIRS (Motorola Integrated Radio System) in
early 1991 and was phased out the summer of 2013 for the US markets although coverage still
exists in Mexico and Canada.

Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), IS-54 and IS-136 are 2G mobile phone systems once prevalent
within the United States and Canada in the 1990s. Existing networks were mostly replaced by
GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 technologies.

Mobile devices work with certain subsets of the network types mentioned, typically those
associated with a service provider from whom the phone was obtained and with whom a
service agreement was entered. Mobile devices may also be acquired without service from any
manufacturer, vendor, or other source and subsequently have their service set up separately
with a service provider or network operator. Mobile devices that are permitted to be
provisioned to more than one specific carrier are commonly referred to as “unlocked” as they
may be used on a variety of carriers by switching UICC’s for GSM mobile devices.

Mobile devices do exist that provide the user with both GSM and CDMA capabilities. Such
devices are sometimes referred to as hybrid phones or global phones. These types of mobile
devices contain two types of cellular radios for voice and data, providing the ability to operate
over either the GSM or CDMA network.

As the name implies, cellular networks provide coverage based on dividing up a large
geographical service area into smaller areas of coverage called cells. Cells play an important
role in reuse of radio frequencies in the limited radio spectrum available to allow more calls to
occur than otherwise would be possible. As a mobile device moves from one cell to another, a
cellular arrangement requires active connections to be monitored and effectively passed along
between cells to maintain the connection. To administer the cellular network system, provide
subscribed services, and accurately bill or debit subscriber accounts, data about the service
contract and associated service activities is captured and maintained by the network system.

Despite their differences in technology, cellular networks are organized similarly to one
another, in a manner illustrated in Figure 4 [Gib02]. The main components are the radio
transceiver equipment that communicates with mobile devices, the controller that manages the
transceiver equipment and performs channel assignment, and the switching system for the
cellular network. The technical names for these components are respectively Node B,
representing a Base Transceiver Station (BTS), the Radio Network Controller (RNC), and the
Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The RNCs and the Node B units controlled are sometimes
collectively referred to as a Radio Access Network (RAN).

      Each MSC controls a set of RNCs and manages overall communications throughout the
      cellular network, including registration, authentication, location updating, handovers, and call
      routing. An MSC interfaces with the public switch telephone network (PSTN) via a Gateway
      MSC (GMSC). To perform its tasks, an MSC uses several databases. A key database is the
      central repository system for subscriber data and service information, called the Home
      Location Register (HLR). Another database used in conjunction with the HLR is the Visitor
      Location Register (VLR), which is used for mobile devices roaming outside of their service
      area. An SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) performs a similar role as that of MSC/VLR,
      but instead supports General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (i.e., packet-switched services) to
      the Internet. Likewise, GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) functionality is close to that of
      a GMSC, but for packet-switched services.

      Account information, such as data about the subscriber (e.g., a billing address), the subscribed
      services, and the location update last registered with the network are maintained at the HLR
      and used by the MSC to route calls and messages and to generate usage records called Call
      Detail Records (CDR). The subscriber account data, CDRs, and related technical information
      obtained from the network carrier are often a valuable source of evidence in an investigation
      [Con09].

2.5   Other Communications Systems

      Mobile IP is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)6 standard communications protocol
      that is designed to allow mobile device users to move from one network to another while

maintaining a permanent IP address.7 With the original IP protocol, each time a mobile device
moved to a new Internet point of attachment, all active network connections had to be restarted
and the device possibly needed to be rebooted. Mobile IP instead allows a mobile user to move
about transparently while continuing to use the same IP address (the user's "home address"),
avoiding these problems and enabling new mobile applications. Mobile IP was designed to
support seamless and continuous Internet connectivity. Mobile IP is most often found in
wireless environments where users need to carry their mobile devices across multiple Local
Area Network (LAN) subnets. Examples of use are in roaming between overlapping wireless
systems e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX), IP over Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Broadband
Wireless Access (BWA).8

Individuals requiring communication services from remote locations (e.g., aviation, emergency
services, government, military, etc.) are often equipped with satellite phones. Satellite phones
are mobile devices that establish connectivity with satellites rather than cellular towers.
Typically, satellite phones require a direct line of sight to the satellite without obstruction of
objects (e.g., buildings, trees, etc.) impacting the signal strength and quality of the call.
Depending on the service, coverage may range from a specific area all the way to the entire
earth. For example, the Iridium satellite constellation is made up of 66 Low Earth Orbiting
(LEO) satellites with spares, providing worldwide voice and data communications.




                                     Figure 5: Satellite Phone Network

Satellite phones communicate by sending radio signals to a satellite that transmits a signal back
down to earth where a station routes the call to the PSTN. In some cases, the satellite phone

provider will transmit from one satellite to another satellite that has a connection to an Earth
station. Much like GSM based mobile devices, satellite phones are equipped with a UICC and
provide users with a wide variety of features (e.g., contact list, text messaging, voicemail, call
forwarding, etc.).

3. Forensic Tools

       The availability of forensic software tools for mobile devices is considerably different from
       that of personal computers. While personal computers may differ from mobile devices from a
       hardware and software perspective, their functionality has become increasingly similar.
       Although the majority of mobile device operating systems are open source (i.e., Android),
       feature phone OS’s are typically closed. Closed operating systems make interpreting their
       associated file system and structure difficult. Many mobile devices with the same operating
       system may also vary widely in their implementation, resulting in a myriad of file system and
       structure permutations. These permutations create significant challenges for mobile forensic
       tool manufacturers and examiners.

       The types of software available for mobile device examination include commercial and open
       source forensic tools, as well as non-forensic tools intended for device management, testing,
       and diagnostics. Forensic tools are typically designed to acquire data from the internal memory
       of handsets and UICCs without altering their content and to calculate integrity hashes for the
       acquired data. Both forensic and non-forensic software tools often use the same protocols and
       techniques to communicate with a device. However, non-forensic tools may allow unrestricted
       two-way flow of information and omit data integrity hash functions. Mobile device examiners
       typically assemble a collection of both forensic and non-forensic tools for their toolkit. The
       range of devices over which they operate is typically narrowed to: distinct platforms, a specific
       operating system family or even a single type of hardware architecture. Short product release
       cycles are the norm for mobile devices, requiring tool manufacturers to continually update
       their tools providing forensics examiners with an forensic solution. The task is formidable and
       tool manufacturers’ support for newer models may lag significantly behind the introduction of
       a device into the marketplace. Models of older functioning mobile devices, though out of date,
       can remain in use for years after their initial release. Mobile device models introduced into one
       national market may also be used in areas by exchanging the UICC of one cellular carrier with
       that from another carrier. The current state is likely to continue, keeping the cost of
       examination significantly higher than if a few standard operating systems and hardware
       configurations prevailed.

 3.1   Mobile Device Tool Classification System

       Understanding the various types of mobile acquisition tools and the data they are capable of
       recovering is important for a mobile forensic examiner. The classification system used in this
       section provides a framework for forensic examiners to compare the extraction methods used
       by different tools to acquire data. The objective of the tool classification system is to enable an
       examiner to easily classify and compare the extraction method of different tools. The tool
       classification system is displayed in Figure 6 [Bro08]. As the pyramid is traversed from the
       bottom, Level 1, to the top, Level 5, the methodologies involved in acquisition become more
       technical, invasive, time consuming, and expensive.

       Level 1, Manual Extraction methods involve recording information brought up on a mobile
       device screen when employing the user interface. Level 2, Logical Extraction methods are
       used most frequently at this time and are mildly technical, requiring beginner-level training.
       Methods for levels 3 to 5 entail extracting and recording a copy or image of a physical store
       (e.g., a memory chip), compared to the logical acquisitions used at level 2 involve capturing a
       copy of logical storage objects (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical store (e.g., a

                                                   15
                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

file system partition). Level 3, Hex Dumping/JTAG Extraction methods, entail performing a
“physical acquisition” of mobile device memory in situ and require advanced training. Level 4
Chip-Off methods involve the physical removal of memory from a mobile device to extract
data, requiring extensive training in electronic engineering and file system forensics. Level 5,
Micro Read methods involve the use of a high-powered microscope to view the physical state
of gates. Level 5 methods are the most invasive, sophisticated, technical, expensive, and time
consuming of all the methodologies.

There are pros and cons to performing extraction types at each layer. For example, hex
dumping allows deleted objects and any data remnants present to be examined (e.g., in
unallocated memory or file system space), which otherwise would be inaccessible through the
use of logical acquisition methods. However, the extracted device images require parsing,
decryption and decoding. Logical acquisition methods, though more limited than Hex
Dumping/JTAG methods, have the advantage in that the system data structures are at a higher
level of abstraction and are normally easier for a tool to extract and render. These differences
are due to the underlying distinction between memory as seen by a process via the operating
system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the processor or
another hardware component (i.e., a physical view). Based upon a wide variety of
circumstances (e.g., type of data needed, time available, urgency, available tools, etc.), an
examiner may select a specific level to begin their examination. It is important to note that
once a level is used, alternate levels may not be possible. For example, after performing chip-
off (level 4) lower level tools may not be physically possible. Forensic examiners should be
aware of such issues and perform the appropriate level of extraction commensurate with their
training and experience. With each methodology, data may be permanently destroyed or
modified if a given tool or procedure is not proper utilized. The risk of alteration and
destruction increases in tandem with the levels. Thus, proper training and mentoring is critical
in obtaining the highest success rate for data extraction and analysis of the data contained
within mobile devices.

                    Figure 6: Mobile Device Tool Classification System

The following discussion provides a more detailed description of each level and the methods
used for data extraction.

       Manual Extraction – A manual extraction method involves viewing the data content
        stored on a mobile device. The content displayed on the LCD screen requires the
        manual manipulation of the buttons, keyboard or touchscreen to view the contents of
        the mobile device. Information discovered may be recorded using an external digital
        camera. At this level, it is impossible to recover deleted information. Some tools have
        been developed to provide the forensic examiner with the ability to document and
        categorize the information recorded more quickly. Nevertheless, if there is a large
        amount of data to be captured, a manual extraction can be very time consuming and
        the data on the device may be inadvertently modified, deleted or overwritten as a
        result of the examination. Manual extractions become increasingly difficult and
        perhaps unachievable when encountering a broken/missing LCD screen or a
        damaged/missing keyboard interface. Additional challenges occur when the device is
        configured to display a language unknown to the investigator; this may cause
        difficulty in successful menu navigation.

       Logical Extraction – Connectivity between a mobile device and the forensics
        workstation is achieved with a connection using either a wired (e.g., USB or RS-232)
        or wireless (e.g., IrDA, WiFi, or Bluetooth) connection. The examiner should be
        aware of the issues associated when selecting a specific connectivity method, as
        different connection types and associated protocols may result in data being modified
        (e.g., unread SMS) or different amounts or types of data being extracted. Logical
        extraction tools begin by sending a series of commands over the established interface
        from the computer to the mobile device. The mobile device responds based upon the
        command request. The response (mobile device data) is sent back to the workstation
        and presented to the forensics examiner for reporting purposes.

       Hex Dumping and JTAG – Hex Dumping and Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)
        extraction methods afford the forensic examiner more direct access to the raw
                                          17
                                                Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

information stored in flash memory. One challenge with these extraction methods is
the ability of a given tool to parse and decode the captured data. Providing the forensic
examiner with a logical view of the file system, and reporting on other data remnants
outside the file system that may be present are challenging. For example, all data
contained within a given flash memory chip may not be acquired, as many tools, such
as flasher boxes, may only be able to extract specific sections of memory [Bre07].
Methods used at this level require connectivity (e.g., cable or WiFi) between the
mobile device and the forensic workstation.

Hex Dumping – this technique is the more commonly used method by tools at this
level. This involves uploading a modified boot loader (or other software) into a
protected area of memory (e.g., RAM) on the device. This upload process is
accomplished by connecting the mobile device’s data port to a flasher box and the
flasher box is in turn connected to the forensic workstation. A series of commands is
sent from the flasher box to the mobile device to place it in a diagnostic mode. Once
in diagnostic mode, the flasher box captures all (or sections) of flash memory and
sends it to the forensic workstation over the same communications link used for the
upload. Some flasher boxes work this way or they may use a proprietary interface for
memory extractions. Rare cases exist where extractions can be accomplished using
WiFi (i.e., early Jonathan Zdziarski (JZ) Methods) [Zdz12].

JTAG – Many manufacturers support the JTAG standard, which defines a common
test interface for processor, memory, and other semiconductor chips. Forensic
examiners can communicate with a JTAG-compliant component by utilizing special
purpose standalone programmer devices to probe defined test points [Wil05]. The
JTAG testing unit can be used to request memory addresses from the JTAG-
compliant component and accept the response for storage and rendition [Bre06].
JTAG gives specialists another avenue for imaging devices that are locked or devices
that may have minor damage and cannot be properly interfaced otherwise. This
method involves attaching a cable (or wiring harness) from a workstation to the
mobile device’s JTAG interface and access memory via the device’s microprocessor
to produce an image [Bre07]. JTAG extractions differ mainly from Hex Dumping in
that it is invasive as access to the connections frequently require that the examiner
dismantle some (or most) of a mobile device to obtain access to establish the wiring
connections.

Flasher boxes are small devices originally designed with the intent to service or
upgrade mobile devices. Physical acquisitions frequently require the use of a flasher
box to facilitate the extraction of data from a mobile device. The flasher box aides the
examiner by communicating with the mobile device using diagnostic protocols to
communicate with the memory chip. This communication may utilize the mobile
device’s operating system or may bypass it altogether and communicate directly to the
chip [Jon10]. Flasher boxes are often accompanied by software to facilitate the data
extraction process working in conjunction with the hardware. Many flasher box
software packages provide the added functionality of recovering passwords from
mobile device memory as well in some configurations. Although acquisition methods
differ between flasher boxes, a general process is used [Bre07]. Limitations of the use
of flasher boxes include the following:



                                  18
                                                     Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       Rebooting of the mobile device is frequently required to begin the extraction
        process; this may cause authentication mechanisms to activate preventing further
        analysis.

       Many flasher boxes recover the data in an encrypted format requiring the
        examiner to either use the software provided by the flasher box manufacturer to
        decrypt the data or may require reverse engineering the data’s encryption scheme
        by the analyst.

       Many phone models do not provide the acquisition of the entire memory range
        within a given mobile device. Only certain ranges may be available for certain
        mobile devices

       The flasher box service software often has many buttons that are labeled with
        nearly identical names. This confusion may easily lead even an experienced
        examiner to press the wrong button, erasing the contents of the mobile device
        instead of dumping the memory.

       Lack of documentation on the use of the flasher box tools is common. Extraction
        methods are frequently shared on forums supported by the vendor and moderated
        by more seasoned users. Caution should be taken when advice is provided, as not
        all the information provided is correct.

       Forensic Use: Nearly all flasher boxes were not designed with a forensic use as its
        intended purpose. Examiners must be experienced in the use of flasher boxes and
        should understand the proper use and function of flasher boxes.

       Despite all of these limitations, use of a flasher box is a viable option for many
        forensics cases. Proper training, experience and understating of how the tools
        work are the keys to success.

    A wide range of technical expertise and proper training is required for extracting and
    analyzing binary images with these methods, including locating and connecting to
    JTAG ports, creating customized boot loaders and recreating file systems.

   Chip-Off – Chip-Off methods refer to the acquisition of data directly from a mobile
    device’s flash memory. This extraction requires the physical removal of flash
    memory. Chip-Off provides examiners with the ability to create a binary image of the
    removed chip. In order to provide the examiner with data in a contiguous binary
    format file, the wear-leveling algorithm must be reverse engineered. Once complete,
    the binary image may then be analyzed. This type of acquisition is most closely
    related to physical imaging a hard disk drive as in traditional digital forensics.
    Extensive training is required in order to successfully perform extractions at this level.
    Chip-Off extractions are challenging based on a wide variety of chip types, a myriad
    of raw data formats, and the risk of causing physical damage to the chip during the
    extraction process. Due to the complexities related to Chip-Off, JTAG extraction is
    more common.

   Micro Read – A Micro Read involves recording the physical observation of the gates
    on a NAND or NOR chip with the use of an electron microscope. Due to the extreme
    technicalities involved when performing a Micro Read, this level of acquisition would
                                       19
                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

        only be attempted for high profile cases equivalent to a national security crisis after all
        other acquisition techniques have been exhausted. Successful acquisition at this level
        would require a team of experts, proper equipment, time and in-depth knowledge of
        proprietary information. There are no known U.S. Law Enforcement agencies
        performing acquisitions at this level. Currently, there are no commercially available
        Micro Read tools.

and identifies the facilities they provide: acquisition, examination, or reporting. Additional
tools do exist, but only those familiar to the authors are discussed. For a more complete an up

3.2   UICC Tools

      A few mobile forensics tools deal exclusively with UICCs. These tools perform a direct read
      of a UICC’s contents via a Personal Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader, as opposed to an
      indirect read via the mobile device. The richness and scope of data acquired varies with the
      capabilities and features of the tool. The majority of UICC exclusive tools acquire the
      following data: International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Integrated Circuit Card ID
      (ICCID), Abbreviated Dialing Numbers (ADN), Last Numbers Dialed (LND), SMS messages,
      and Location Information (LOCI) [Aye12].

      Most tools provide additional information such as deleted SMS messages, properly rendered
      foreign language SMS and EMS messages. They also attempt to translate certain data such as
      country and network operator codes into meaningful names, and provide other facilities such
      as PIN administration.

      CSIM partitions on UICCs are being used with increasing frequency for LTE enabled mobile
      devices. At this time, few tools support the extraction of CSIM partition data as most only

           This tool only performs data analysis.
                                                                     23
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       support extraction of GSM and USIM partitions. CSIM data may prove to be of increasing
       forensic importance as this technology evolves.

 3.3   Obstructed Devices

       The following sections discuss techniques for bypassing an obstructed device i.e., a mobile
       device that requires successful authentication using a password or some other means to obtain
       access to the device. A number of ways exist to recover data from obstructed devices. These
       methods fall into one of three categories: software-based, hardware-based and investigative.
       Common obstructed devices include those with missing identity modules, PIN-enabled
       UICCs, or an enabled mobile device lock. Password locked and encrypted memory cards
       provide a user with additional means to protect data. This protection may make recovery of
       such data more complex. Content encryption capabilities are offered as a standard feature in
       many mobile devices or may be available through add-on applications. Software and
       hardware-based methods are often directed at a particular device or narrow class of device.

       As mobile forensics tools have evolved, they have begun to provide automated functions
       allowing examiners to bypass many security mechanisms as a part of their products. For
       instance, some tools provide an automated function to recover passwords from locked mobile
       devices. In developing a method, the following sections provide actions that should be
       considered for determining possible approaches.

3.3.1 Software and Hardware Based Methods

       Software-based methods used to break or bypass authentication mechanisms have begun to
       appear. For instance, some tools provide an automated function to recover passwords from
       locked mobile devices. This type of functionality varies greatly between mobile forensic tools
       and the devices models that are supported.

       Hardware-based methods involve a combination of software and hardware to break or bypass
       authentication mechanisms and gain access to the device. For example, the value of a mobile
       device lock can be readily recovered from a memory dump of certain devices, allowing for a
       follow-on logical acquisition. JTAG and flasher boxes are often used this way to circumvent
       authentication mechanisms. Device-specific attacks, such as cold boot attacks, exist to bypass
       authentication mechanisms. Cold boot attacks have the ability to recover passwords from
       locked Android based devices by cooling the device 10 degrees below Celsius followed by
       disconnecting and reconnecting the battery in 500ms intervals [Mül12].

       Few general-purpose hardware-based methods apply to a general class of mobile devices.
       Most of the techniques are tailored for a specific model within a class.

3.3.2 Investigative Methods

       Investigative methods are procedures the investigative team can apply, which require no
       forensic software or hardware tools. The most obvious methods are the following:

              Ask the owner – If a device is protected with a password, PIN or other authentication
               mechanism involving knowledge-based authentication, the owner may be queried for
               this information during an interview.


                                                24
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             Review seized material – Passwords or PINs may be written down on a slip of paper
              and kept with or near the phone, at a desktop computer used to synchronize with the
              mobile device, or with the owner, such as in a wallet, and may be recovered through
              visual inspection. Packaging material for a UICC or a mobile device may disclose a
              PIN Unlocking Key (PUK) that may be used to reset the value of the PIN. Device
              specific vulnerabilities may also be exploited, such as Smudge attacks. Smudge
              attacks involved careful analysis of the surface of a touch screen device to determine
              the most recent gesture lock used [Avi10].

             Ask the service provider – If a GSM mobile device is protected with a PIN-enabled
              UICC, the identifier (i.e., the ICCID) may be obtained from it and used to request the
              PUK from the service provider and reset the PIN. Some service providers offer the
              ability to retrieve the PUK online, by entering the telephone number of the mobile
              device and specific subscriber information into public web pages set up for this
              purpose. Additionally, information may be obtained by contacting the device
              manufacturer (e.g., Apple).

      Mobile device users may choose weak passwords to secure their device such as: 1-1-1-1, 0-0-
      0-0 or 1-2-3-4. Some of these numeric combinations are device default passcodes provided by
      the manufacturer. It is not recommended to attempt to unlock a device using these
      combinations due to several risk factors. They may include permanent wiping of mobile
      device memory, enabling additional security mechanisms (e.g., PIN/PUK) or initializing
      destructive applications. Mobile devices generally have a defined number of attempts before
      enabling further security precautions. Before making any attempts at unlocking a mobile
      device, it is recommended to consider the number of attempts left. There may be an instance
      where an examiner may choose to accept these risks in cases where this is the only option for
      data extraction.

3.4   Forensic Tool Capabilities

      Forensic software tools strive to handle conventional investigative needs by addressing a wide
      range of applicable devices. More difficult situations, such as the recovery of deleted data from
      the memory of a device, may require more specialized tools and expertise and disassembly of
      the device. The range of support provided, including mobile device cables and drivers, product
      documentation, PC/SC readers, and the frequency of updates, may vary significantly among
      products. The features offered such as searching, bookmarking, and reporting capabilities may
      also vary considerably.

      Discrepancies in recovering and reporting the data residing on a device have been noted in
      previous testing of tools. They include the inability to recover resident data, inconsistencies
      between the data displayed on workstation and that generated in output reports, truncated data
      in reported or displayed output, errors in the decoding and translation of recovered data, and
      the inability to recover all relevant data. On occasion, updates or new versions of a tool were
      also found to be less capable in some aspects than a previous version was [Aye11, Jan09].

      Tools should be validated to ensure their acceptability and reapplied when updates or new
      versions of the tool become available. These results play a factor in deciding the
      appropriateness of the tool, how to compensate for any noted shortcomings, and whether to
      consider using a different version or update of the tool. Validating a tool entails defining and
      identifying a comprehensive set of test data, following acquisition procedures to recover the
      test data, and assessing the results [Aye11, Jan09]. Present-day tools seldom provide the means
                                                 25
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

to obtain detailed logs of data extraction and other transactions that would aid in validation. An
examiner can compare the output of several tools to verify the consistency of results. While
tool validation is time consuming, it is a necessary practice to follow. As a quality measure,
forensic specialists should also receive adequate up-to-date training in the tools and procedures
they employ.

An important characteristic of a forensic tool is its ability to maintain the integrity of the
original data source being acquired and also that of the extracted data. The former is done by
blocking or otherwise eliminating write requests to the device containing the data. The latter is
done by computing a cryptographic hash over the contents of the evidence files created and
recurrently verifying that this value remains unchanged throughout the lifetime of those files.
Preserving integrity not only maintains credibility from a legal perspective, but it also allows
any subsequent investigation to use the same baseline for replicating the analysis.


    Forensic Hash Validation: A forensic hash is used to maintain the integrity of an acquisition by
    computing a cryptographically strong, non-reversible value over the acquired data. After
    acquisition, any changes made to the data may be detected, since a new hash value computed
    over the data will be inconsistent with the old value. For non-forensic tools, hash values should be
    created using a tool such as sha1sum and retained for integrity verification. Even tools labeled as
    forensic tools may not compute a cryptographic hash, and in these cases an integrity hash should
    be computed separately.

    Note that mobile devices are constantly active and update information (e.g., the device clock)
    continuously. Therefore, back-to-back acquisitions of a device will be slightly different and
    produce different hash values when computed over all the data. However, hash values computed
    over selected data items, such as individual files and directories, generally remain consistent.
    Hash inconsistencies may occur requiring the examiner to perform an element-by-element
    verification ensuring data integrity. Hash validation across multiple tools is challenging due to
    proprietary reporting formats.

4. Preservation

       Sections 4 through 7 describe the forensics process as it applies to mobile devices. Evidence
       preservation is the process of securely maintaining custody of property without altering or
       changing the contents of data that reside on devices and removable media. It is the first step in
       digital evidence recovery. The chapter begins with a generic introduction to preservation, and
       then provides more specific guidance about how to deal with mobile devices.

       Preservation involves the search, recognition, documentation, and collection of electronic-
       based evidence. In order to use evidence successfully, whether in a court of law or a less
       formal proceeding, it must be preserved. Failure to preserve evidence in its original state could
       jeopardize an entire investigation, potentially losing valuable case-related information.

       The remaining sections of this chapter provide supplemental information related to mobile
       devices, following the paradigm of Securing and Evaluating the Scene, Documenting the
       Scene, Isolation, Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence, and Triage/On-Site
       Processing.

 4.1   Securing and Evaluating the Scene

       Incorrect procedures or improper handling of a mobile device during seizure may cause loss of
       digital data. Moreover, traditional forensic measures, such as fingerprints or DNA testing, may
       need to be applied to establish a link between a mobile device and its owner or user. If the
       device is not handled properly, physical evidence may be contaminated and rendered useless.

       Alertness to mobile device characteristics and issues (e.g., memory volatility) and familiarity
       with tangential equipment (e.g., media, cables, and power adapters) are essential. For mobile
       devices, sources of evidence include the device, UICC and associated media. Associated
       peripherals, cables, power adapters, and other accessories are also of interest. All areas of the
       scene should be searched thoroughly ensuring related evidence is not overlooked.

       Equipment associated with the mobile device, such as removable media, UICCs, or personal
       computers, may prove more valuable than the mobile device itself. Removable media varies in
       size and can be easily hidden and difficult to find. Most often, removable memory cards are
       identifiable by their distinctive shape and the presence of electrical contacts located on their
       bodies that are used to establish an interface with the device. Personal computers may be
       particularly useful in later accessing a locked mobile device, if the personal computer has
       established a trusted relationship with it. For example, Apple incorporates a pairing process
       whereby an existing pairing record file can be used by some tools [Zdz12] to access the mobile
       device while it is still locked.

       When interviewing the owner or user of a mobile device, consider requesting any security
       codes, passwords or gestures needed to gain access to its contents. For example, GSM devices
       may have authentication codes set for the internal memory and/or the UICC.

       While securing a mobile device, caution should be taken when an individual is allowed to
       handle the mobile device. Many mobile devices have master reset codes that clear the contents
       of the device to original factory conditions. Master resets may be performed remotely requiring
       proper precautions such as network isolation to ensure that evidence is not modified or
       destroyed.
                                                  27
                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      Mobile devices may be found in a compromised state that may complicate seizure, such as
      immersion in a liquid. In these situations, forensic examiners should adhere to agency specific
      procedures. One method involves removal of the battery preventing electrical shorting, while
      the remainder of the mobile device is sealed in an appropriate container filled with the same
      liquid for transport to the lab, provided the liquid is not caustic. Some compromised states,
      such as blood contamination or use with explosives (i.e., as a bomb component) can pose a
      danger to the technician collecting evidence. In such situations, a specialist should be consulted
      for specific instructions or assistance.

      Mobile devices and associated media may be found in a damaged state, caused by accidental
      or deliberate action. Devices or media with visible external damage do not necessarily prevent
      the extraction of data. Damaged equipment should be taken back to the lab for closer
      inspection. Repairing damaged components on a mobile device and restoring the device to
      working order for examination and analysis may be possible.

      Undamaged memory components may also be removed from a damaged device and their
      contents recovered independently. This method should be used with caution, as it is not
      possible with all devices.

4.2   Documenting the Scene

      Evidence must be accurately identified and accounted for. Non-electronic materials such as
      invoices, manuals, and packaging material may provide useful information about the
      capabilities of the device, the network used, account information, and unlocking codes for the
      PIN. Photographing the crime scene in conjunction with documenting a report on the state of
      each digital device and all computers encountered may be helpful in the investigation, if
      questions arise later about the environment.

      A record of all visible data should be created. All digital devices, including mobile devices,
      which may store data, should be photographed along with all peripherals cables, power
      connectors, removable media, and connections. Avoid touching or contaminating the mobile
      device when photographing it and the environment where found. If the device’s display is in a
      viewable state, the screen’s contents should be photographed and, if necessary, recorded
      manually, capturing the time, service status, battery level, and other displayed icons.

4.3   Isolation

      Many mobile devices offer the user with the ability to perform either a remote lock or remote
      wipe by simply sending a command (e.g., text message) to the mobile device.

      Additional reasons for disabling network connectivity include incoming data (e.g., calls or text
      messages) that may modify the current state of the data stored on the mobile device. Outgoing
      data may also be undesirable as the current GPS location may be delivered to an advisory
      providing the geographic location of the forensic examiner.

      Therefore, forensic examiners need to be aware and take precautions when securing mobile
      devices mitigating the chance of data modification. The Scientific Working Group on Digital
      Evidence’s (SWGDE) “Best Practices for Mobile Phone Forensics” document covers best
      practice for the proper isolation of mobile devices [SWG13]. Some key implications for proper
      collection are summarized below.

                                                 28
                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Isolating the mobile device from other devices used for data synchronization is important to
keep new data from contaminating existing data. If the device is found in a cradle or connected
with a personal computer, pulling the plug from the back of the personal computer eliminates
data transfer or synchronization overwrites. It is recommended that a capture of the personal
computer’s memory be extracted before “pulling the plug” as memory acquired generally
proves to be of significant forensic value. Caution should be used, as removing a device that if
performing a software update or backup has the potential to corrupt the mobile device’s file
system. The use of memory forensics tools for the capture of a personal computer’s memory
should be done by a qualified digital forensics professional. The mobile device should be
seized along with associated hardware. Media cards, UICCs, and other hardware residing in
the mobile device should not be removed. Also, seizing the computer that was connected to the
mobile device provides the ability to acquire synchronized data from the hard disk that might
not be obtained from the device. Any associated hardware such as media cards, UICCs, power
adapters, device sleeves, or peripherals, should be seized along with related materials such as
product manuals, packaging, and software.

Isolating a mobile device from all radio networks (e.g. WiFi, Cellular and Bluetooth) is
important to keep new traffic, such as SMS messages, from overwriting existing data. Besides
the risk of overwriting potential evidence, the question may arise whether data received on the
mobile device after seizure is within the scope of the original authority granted. Vulnerabilities
may exist that may exploit a weaknesses related to software vulnerabilities from the web
browser and OS, SMS, MMS, third-party applications and WiFi networks. The possibility of
such vulnerabilities being exploited may permit the argument that data may have been
modified during the forensic examination.

Three basic methods for isolating the mobile device from radio communication and preventing
these problems are to either: place the device in airplane mode, turn the device off, or lastly
place the device in a shielded container. Each method has certain drawbacks.

       Enabling “Airplane Mode” requires interaction with the mobile device using the
        keypad, which poses some risk – less so, if the technician is familiar with the device in
        question and documents the actions taken (e.g., on paper or on video). Note: airplane
        mode does not prevent the system from using other services such as GPS in all cases.

       Turning off the mobile device may activate authentication codes (e.g., UICC PIN
        and/or handset security codes), which are then required to gain access to the device,
        complicating acquisition and delaying examination.

       Keeping the mobile device on, but radio isolated, shortens battery life due to increased
        power consumption as devices unable to connect to a network raise their signal
        strength to maximum. After some period, failure to connect to the network may cause
        certain mobile devices to reset or clear network data that otherwise would be useful if
        recovered [Smi05]. Faraday containers may attenuate the radio signal, but not
        necessarily eliminate it completely, allowing the possibility of communications being
        established with a cell tower, if in its immediate vicinity. The risk of improperly
        sealing the Faraday container (e.g., bag improperly sealed, exposed cables connected
        to the forensic workstation may act as an antenna) and unknowingly allowing access
        to the cell network also exists.

To conserve power, some mobile devices are normally configured to enter energy savings
mode and shut off the display after a short period of inactivity. Some devices also shut
                                           29
                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

themselves off if the battery level drops below a certain threshold to protect data stored in
volatile memory, which defeats the original purpose of keeping it turned on. Keeping such a
device in the active state is troublesome, requiring periodic interaction with the device. If
additional power cannot be supplied to a device and it is turned off to conserve power and
preserve memory contents, the risk of encountering a protection mechanism when turned on
again is likely. Moreover, authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, typically cannot be
deactivated without first satisfying the mechanism (e.g., supplying the correct password).

The time maintained on the mobile device may be set independently of that from the network.
Always record the date and time shown on the handset, if it is turned on, and compare them
with a reference clock, noting any inconsistencies. If the screen is dim due to power
management, it may be necessary to press an “insignificant” key, such as the volume key, to
light the screen.

Security mechanisms, key remapping and malicious programs may be present on mobile
devices. Certain types of modifications to the software applications and operating system of
the device might affect the way it is handled. The following is a list of examples of some
classes of modifications to consider:

         Security Enhancements – Organizations and individuals may enhance their handheld
          devices with add-on security mechanisms. A variety of login, biometric, and other
          authentication mechanisms are available for mobile devices may be as replacements
          or supplements to password mechanisms. Improper interaction with a mechanism
          could cause the device to lock down and even destroy its contents. This is particularly
          a concern with mechanisms that use security tokens whose presence is constantly
          monitored and whose disconnection from a card slot or other device interface is
          immediately acted upon.

         Malicious Programs – A mobile device may contain a virus or other malicious
          software. Such malware13 may attempt to spread to other devices over wired or
          wireless interfaces, including cross-platform jumps to completely different platforms.
          Common utilities or functions may also be intentionally replaced with versions of
          software designed to alter or damage data present on a mobile device. Such programs
          could conditionally be activated or suppressed based on conditions such as input
          parameters or hardware key interrupts. Watchdog applications could also be written to
          listen for specific events (e.g., key chords or over the air messages) and carry out
          actions such as deleting the contents of the device.

         Key Remapping – Hardware keys may be remapped to perform a different function
          than the default. A key press or combination of key presses intended for one purpose
          could launch an arbitrary program.

         Geo Fencing – Some devices may be configured to automatically wipe all data when
          the GPS in the device determines that it has left (or entered) a specific predetermined
          geographic area. This method may also employ WiFi towers for location
          determination as well.

                 Explosives and Booby Traps – Mobile devices may be rigged to detonate bombs
                  remotely or explode themselves if a specific action is carried out on the device (e.g.,
                  receiving an incoming call, text message or pressing a specific key chord sequence,
                  etc.).14

                 Alarms – Many mobile devices have an audible alarm feature. The alarm function is
                  capable of powering on an inactive device, establishing network connectivity and the
                  potential for a remote wipe.

      The following sections 4.3.1 through 4.3.3 discuss the use and characteristics of radio isolation
      containers and cellular network isolation techniques.

4.3.1 Radio Isolation Containers

      A field test on the effectiveness of various mobile phone shielding devices (i.e., a tool designed
      to act as a Faraday cage) was conducted at Purdue University. There are many shielding
      devices that claim to radio isolate a mobile device unfortunately these tools do not always
      successfully prevent network communication [Kat10]. The tests conducted at Purdue used
      multiple shielding devices with mobile devices operating over three of the largest U.S.
      providers while varying the distance from the provider’s towers.

      The majority of the test cases proved that the shielding devices tested did not prevent network
      communication in all cases, and SMS messages most often penetrated the device while
      shielded, followed by voice calls and MMS messages. Three reasons why the shielding
      devices may fail are due to: the materials not providing enough attenuation, leaks or seams in
      the shield or the conductive shield acting as an antenna.

      While many manufacturers claim the effectiveness of their shielding device it is important to
      understand the effectiveness of the isolation device is based upon attenuating signal between
      specific decibels. Therefore, the effectiveness of the isolation containers tested were not 100%
      effective in most cases and devices used to preserve evidence require verification.

      Some of the products mentioned in the above paper have since been improved to provide a
      more effective radio isolation solution. Examiners should test their own products to validate
      that they are working properly before use.

4.3.2 Cellular Network Isolation Techniques

      A number of techniques exist for isolating a mobile device from cell tower communications
      [INT06]. The device should be fully charged prior to examination and consideration should be
      given to having a fixed or portable power source attached. The following provides an overview
      of various cellular network isolation techniques.

                 Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) - A CNIC mimics the identity of the original
                  UICC and prevents network access to/from the handset. Such cards prevent the
                  handset from erasing call log data due to a foreign SIM being inserted. This technique
                  permits acquisition without concern of wireless interference.

                                                          31
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             Shielded Containers - A portable shielded container may allow examinations to be
              conducted safely once the phone is situated inside. Cables connected to the container
              must be fully isolated to prevent network communications from occurring. This
              method is one of the most frequently used.

             Shielded Work Areas - Shielding an entire work area can be an expensive but
              effective way to conduct examinations safely in a fixed location. A “Faraday tent” is a
              cheaper alternative that also allows portability. Feeding cables into the tent is
              problematic, however, since without proper isolation they can behave as an antenna,
              defeating the purpose of the tent. The workspace may also be very restrictive.

             Disabling Network Service - The cellular carrier providing service to the mobile
              device might be able to disable service. The service provider or network operator must
              be determined and contacted with details identifying the service to be disabled (e.g.,
              the equipment identifier, subscriber identifier, phone number). Such information is not
              always readily available, however, and the coordination and confirmation process
              may also impose delays.

             Jamming/Spoofing Devices - Emitting a signal stronger than a cell phone’s or
              interfering with the signal rendering communication useless. Another technique
              involves tricking the phone into thinking a “no service” signal is coming from the
              nearest cell tower. Because such devices may affect communications in the
              surrounding public airspace beyond the examination area, unlicensed use may be
              illegal in some jurisdictions. [NIJ05]

4.3.3 Cellular Network Isolation Cards

      Some tools have the ability to create a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) [SWG13].
      CNICs provide cellular network isolation preventing network communication that may modify
      data contained on a mobile device (e.g., remote wiping, incoming text messages). A CNIC
      lacks specific data elements required to establish connectivity between the mobile device and
      its associated network. For example, CNIC’s do not contain a cipher key, thus preventing
      access with a cellular network. A CNIC may be required for mobile device data extraction, as
      some phones are unable to boot without a UICC present.

      Some tool manufacturers and vendors refer to this as a “SIM clone.” The creation of a CNIC
      is not a true clone of the source UICC, because the authentication key and other user data are
      not copied in the cloning process.

      A CNIC may be created either by the examiner using the original UICC as a source or by
      entering the data manually. Manual entry is helpful if the UICC associated with a specific
      mobile device is not present. CNICs are tool specific; they are not interchangeable between the
      tools of various manufacturers. CNICs vary in their effectiveness and support, based on
      specific mobile devices. For example, CNICs may not be used for data extraction from TDMA
      devices.

      Occasionally, a UICC may not be present with a mobile device, or may be intentionally
      damaged, but necessary for data acquisition. One of the most common mistakes forensic
      examiners make is to insert a foreign UICC into the mobile device to facilitate data acquisition.
      Some mobile devices are linked to a specific UICC. When this linkage exists, booting a mobile
      device with a foreign UICC causes data elements such as: call logs (missed, incoming and
                                                 32
                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      outgoing calls) and SMS messages present within the internal memory of the mobile device to
      be erased [Rei08].

      A better approach is to create a substitute UICC (i.e., CNIC) to use with the mobile device that
      mimics key characteristics of the original UICC, tricking the device to accept it as the original.
      Most mobile forensic tools provide the forensic examiner with the ability to create a CNIC.

      Substituting UICCs, sometimes referred to as CNICs, may be useful in a number of situations:

             If a mobile device’s UICC is missing or damaged and is required for acquisition with
              a forensic tool, creation of a CNIC permits data to be recovered from the handset.

             If the UICC for a device is present, but requires a PUK code, a substitute UICC can be
              created providing acquisition to proceed without having to contact the service
              provider for the PUK.

             If cellular network isolation is required (e.g., avoiding incoming calls or text
              messages) a CNIC provides a method permitting acquisition of data from the handset
              while simultaneously denying cellular network authentication.

             If a forensic tool accesses the UICC during the acquisition process, using a CNIC in
              the handset eliminates the possibility of the original being modified (e.g., status flag of
              SMS messages modified from unread to read).

      The values by which the mobile device correlates to the previously inserted UICC are the
      ICCID and the IMSI [Rei08]. Often only one of these values is used. Both identifiers are
      unique and used to authenticate the user to the network. While the minimum data needed to
      create a UICC may be simply one of these two values, some mobile devices may require
      additional data to be populated on the CNIC to be properly recognized. The possibility exists
      that data, other than user data, may change on the handset as the result of inserting a CNIC
      [INT06].

4.4   Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

      Once the mobile device is ready to be seized, the forensic specialist should seal the device in
      an appropriate container and label it appropriately according to agency specifications.

      Due to the volatile nature of some mobile devices, they should immediately be checked into a
      forensic laboratory for processing and the power requirements should be discussed with the
      evidence custodian. Battery powered devices held in storage for more than a day risk power
      depletion and data loss, unless a process is in place to avoid this outcome.

      Storage facilities that hold evidence should provide a cool, dry environment appropriate for
      valuable electronic equipment. All evidence should be in sealed containers in a secure area
      with controlled access.

4.5   On-Site Triage Processing

      Currently many organizations are challenged with large backlogs of digital forensics casework.
      An on-site triage solution is being employed more and more world-wide to accommodate for
      this exponential growth in digital forensic caseload. Triaging involves performing a data
                                                 33
                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

extraction (i.e., Manual or Logical) on-scene followed immediately by a preliminary analysis
of the data extracted. Logical extraction tools are providing additional capabilities to use
keywords and specific known hashes alerting the on-scene examiner immediately to potential
issues that need to be addressed. Where possible, devices supporting encryption, such as
Android and iOS devices, should be triage processed at the scene if they are found in an
unlocked state, as the data may no longer be available to an investigator once the device’s
screen is locked, or if the battery exhausts. Deploying the use of field forensics tools to either
acquire the device, or establish a trusted relationship with the device, will ensure that the data
can be accessed at a later time, after the device has locked. [Zdz12].

On-Site Triage is especially useful in identifying:

       Media most likely to contain evidence

       Those investigations that require a more detailed and technical examination

       The investigations that could be subject of limited examination by qualified
        practitioners

       Material requiring urgent investigation

       Examinations suitable for outsourcing

       The extent of the assistance the unit will need to provide to an investigation [ACP11]

On-Site Triage processing benefits include:

       Reduced laboratory workload - Digital forensic laboratory submissions may be
        reduced when nothing of interest is found on-scene and the level of suspicion is low

       Exigency - On-scene examiners have actionable results immediately

       Better leveraging of existing resources - Intelligence resources are enhanced through
        the use of keywords/hash lists

       Reduced training costs - Triage tools are typically designed to require less training
        than deeper analysis tools and techniques

       Reduced unit cost – Triage tools are frequently more affordable than deeper analysis
        capable counterparts

       Live collection opportunity – Devices are often presented in an unlocked state
        affording the on-site examiner the potential to extract more data before the locking
        mechanism is activated

Organizations may wish to develop some sort of “scoring” method to aid with the
prioritization of on-site triage examinations. This should be developed on a per-organization
basis and should be reviewed and updated to accommodate changes.

4.6   Generic On-Site Decision Tree

      Figure 7 illustrates an example of an on-site decision tree that may be used as a general
      guideline for organizations and agencies. This provides a starting point intended for
      customization allowing alignment with existing policies and procedures. The following list
      describes some of the actions and decision points contained within the tree.

             Unlocked/Undamaged – Is the device in an unlocked state and functional permitting a
              manual or logical data extraction?

             Urgent – Do circumstances exist such that data extraction is required on site?

             Lab less than 2 hours away – Can the mobile device be transported to a forensics
              laboratory in less than 2 hours?

             Tool/Training – Is the device supported by the tool and has the examiner received
              proper training?

             Contact Expert – The on-site examiner should contact an expert for additional
              assistance and guidance.

             Battery More than 50% – Does the device show that it has more than 50% remaining
              battery power?

             Need More Data - After the extraction is successful and the examiner has reviewed
              the results, is additional information or analysis required?

5. Acquisition

       Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise obtaining information from a mobile device
       and its associated media. Performing an acquisition at the scene has the advantage that loss of
       information due to battery depletion, damage, etc. during transportation and storage is avoided.
       Off-site acquisitions unlike a laboratory setting may be challenging in finding a controlled
       setting in which to work with the appropriate equipment while satisfying additional
       prerequisites. For the purpose of this discussion, a laboratory environment is assumed
       throughout this chapter.

       The forensic examination begins with the identification of the mobile device. The type of
       mobile device, its operating system, and other characteristics determine the route to take in
       creating a forensic copy of the contents of the device. The type of mobile device and data to be
       extracted generally dictates which tools and techniques should be used in an investigation.

 5.1   Mobile Device Identification

       To proceed effectively, mobile devices need to be identified by the make, model, and service
       provider. If the mobile device is not identifiable, photographing the front, back and sides of the
       device may be useful in identifying the make, model and current state (e.g., screen lock) at a
       later time. Individuals may attempt to thwart specialists by altering the mobile device to
       conceal its true identity. Device alteration may range from removing manufacturer labels to
       filing off logos. In addition, the operating system and applications may be modified or in rare
       situations completely replaced, and appear differently as well as behave differently than
       expected. These modifications should be taken into consideration on a case-by-case basis.

       If the mobile device is powered on, the information appearing on the display may aid in mobile
       device identification. For example, the manufacturer’s or service provider’s name may appear
       on the display, or the screen layout may indicate the family of operating system used.
       Information such as the manufacturer’s label may be found in the battery cavity (e.g., make,
       model, IMEI, MEID). Removing the battery from the cavity of a mobile device, even when
       powered off, may affect its state, particularly the contents of volatile memory. Most mobile
       devices keep user data in non-volatile memory (i.e., NAND). If the mobile device is powered
       on, battery removal will power it off, possibly causing an authentication mechanism to trigger
       when powered back on.

       Other clues that allow identification of a mobile device include such things as: manufacturer
       logos, serial numbers, or design characteristics (e.g. candy bar, clam shell). Overall, knowing
       the make and model helps to limit the potential service providers, by differentiating the type of
       network the device operates over (i.e., GSM, non-GSM), and vice versa. Synchronization
       software discovered on an associated computer may also help to differentiate among operating
       system families. Further means of identification include the following:

              Device Characteristics – The make and manufacturer of a mobile device may be
               identified by its observable characteristics (e.g., weight, dimensions, and form factor),
               particularly if unique design elements exist. Various web sites contain databases of
               mobile device that may be queried based on selected attributes to identify a particular



                                                  37
                                                                      Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             device and obtain its specifications and features.15 Coverage is considerable, but not
             extensive nor complete, and may require consulting more than one repository before
             making a match.

            Device Interface – The power connector can be specific to a manufacturer and may
             provide clues for device identification. With familiarization and experience, the
             manufacturers of certain mobile devices may be readily identified. Similarly, the size,
             number of contacts, and shape of the data cable interface are often specific to a
             particular manufacturer and may prove helpful in identification.

            Device Label – For mobile devices that are inactive, information obtained from
             within the battery cavity may be of assistance, particularly when coupled with an
             appropriate database. The manufacturer’s label often lists the make and model number
             of the mobile device and also unique identifiers, such as the Federal Communications
             Commission Identification Number (FCC ID) and an equipment identifier (IMEI or
             MEID). The FCC and equipment identifiers may be found on mobile devices sold in
             the U.S. domestic market.

             For all mobile devices that use a UICC, the identity module is typically located under
             the battery and imprinted with a unique identifier called the Integrated Circuit Card
             Identification (ICCID). For powered on GSM and UMTS phones, the International
             Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) may be obtained by keying in *#06#. Similar
             codes exist for obtaining the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) or Mobile Equipment
             Identifier (MEID) from powered on CDMA phones. Various sites on the Internet
             offer databases that provide information about the mobile device based on an
             identifier, such as the following:

                 The IMEI is a 15-digit number that indicates the manufacturer, model type, and
                  country of approval for GSM devices. The initial 8-digit portion of the IMEI,
                  known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), gives the model and origin. The
                  remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer specific, with a check digit at the end
                  [GSM04]. A database lookup service is available from the GSM numbering plan
                  Web site.16

                 The ESN is a 32-bit identifier recorded on a secure chip in a mobile device by the
                  manufacturer. The first 8-14 bits identify the manufacturer and the remaining bits
                  represent the assigned serial number. Many mobile devices have codes that can be
                  input into the handset to display the ESN. Hidden menus may also be activated on
                  certain mobile devices by placing them in “test mode” through the input of a
                  code. Besides the ESN, other useful information such as the phone number of the
                  device may be obtained. Manufacturer codes may be checked online at the
                  Telecommunications Industry Association Web site.17

                        The ICCID of the UICC may be up to 20 digits long. It consists of an industry
                         identifier prefix (89 for telecommunications), followed by a country code, an
                         issuer identifier number, and an individual account identification number
                         [ITU06]. The country and network operator name may be determined by the
                         ICCID. If the ICCID does not appear on the UICC, it may be obtained with a
                         UICC acquisition tool. The GSM numbering plan Web site supports ICCID
                         queries for this information.18

                        The first 3 characters of the FCC ID are the company code; the next 14 are the
                         product code. The FCC provides a database lookup service that can be used to
                         identify a device manufacturer and retrieve information about the mobile device,
                         including photos, user manual, and radio frequency test results.19

                        MEID consists of a set of characters 56-bits in length (14 hex digits). It contains
                         three fields, including an 8-bit regional code (RR), a 24-bit manufacturer code,
                         and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number. The check digit (CD) is not
                         considered part of the MEID. The MEID was created to replace ESNs, as all
                         ESN’s were exhausted by November 2008.

                  Carrier Identification – The carrier for a mobile device may have their logo printed
                   on the exterior. This is traditionally displayed prominently to allow for advertising and
                   branding. This may provide the examiner with insight on which carrier the mobile
                   device operates. Mobile devices may be unlocked and possibly re-flashed to operate
                   using a competing carrier. One method to make this determination is to examine the
                   UICC if present. Most carriers imprint their logo on the front of the UICC.
                   Additionally, extraction and analysis of the ICCID provides further confirmation.

                  Reverse Lookup – The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) provides
                   an automated phone system for law enforcement agencies to determine the current
                   service provider assigned to a number and obtain contact information.20 This service
                   covers both U.S. and Canadian phone numbers. If the telephone number of the mobile
                   device is known, a reverse lookup may be used to identify the network operator and
                   the originating city and state. For example, FoneFinder™ is a service to obtain such
                   information.21 The network operator’s web site typically contains lists of supported
                   devices that may be used to narrow down and possibly identify the mobile device in
                   question. Because phone numbers may be ported among service providers, in many
                   situations more up-to-date information is required.

5.2   Tool Selection and Expectations

      Once the make and model of the mobile device are known, available manuals should be
      retrieved and studied. The manufacturer’s web site is a good place to begin. Typing the model
      number into a search engine may also reveal a significant amount of information about the
      mobile device. As mentioned earlier, the device being acquired largely dictates the choice of

                                                                Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      forensic tools. The following criteria have been suggested as a fundamental set of requirements
      for forensic tools, and should be considered when a choice of tools is available:

             Usability – the ability to present data in a form that is useful to an investigator

             Comprehensive – the ability to present all data to an investigator so that both
              inculpatory and exculpatory evidence can be identified

             Accuracy – the quality of the output of the tool has been verified

             Deterministic – the ability for the tool to produce the same output when given the
              same set of instructions and input data

             Verifiable – the ability to ensure accuracy of the output by having access to
              intermediate translation and presentation results

             Tested – the ability to determine if known data present within the mobile device
              internal memory is not modified and reported accurately by the tool

      Experimenting with various tools on test devices to determine which acquisition tools work
      efficiently with specific mobile device types is highly recommended. Besides gaining
      familiarity with the capabilities of the tool, experimentation allows special purpose search
      filters and custom configurations to be setup before use in an actual case. In addition, any
      needed software updates from the manufacturer can be installed.

      Established procedures should guide the technical process of acquisition, as well as the
      examination of evidence. New circumstances may arise sporadically that require adjustment to
      existing procedures, and in some situations require new procedures and methods to be devised.
      Some examples include: UICCs being permanently bonded into a mobile device, mobile
      devices capable of supporting multiple UICCs and mobile devices that block logical
      acquisition ports until a connection is made with a cell tower. Procedures must be tested to
      ensure that the results obtained are valid and independently reproducible. Testing should occur
      on the same model of mobile device before attempting procedures on the case device. The
      development and validation of the procedures should be documented and include the following
      steps [DOJ08]:

             Identifying the task or problem

             Proposing possible solutions

             Testing each solution on an identical test device and under known control conditions

             Evaluating the results of the test

             Finalizing the procedure

5.3   Mobile Device Memory Acquisition

      Mobile devices are often submitted for laboratory processing with only specific items
      requested for recovery, such as call logs or graphics. If any doubt or concerns exist about the
      requested data, contacting the submitter for clarification is recommended. Though it is not
                                                   40
                                                          Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

always necessary to recover all available data, a complete acquisition avoids having to redo the
process later if additional data is requested. For examinations involving a limited scope search
warrant (e.g., only text messages), a full memory data extraction may be completed but care
should be taken to only report items covered by the warrant.

To acquire data from a mobile device, a connection must be established to the device from the
forensic workstation. Before performing an acquisition, the version of the tool or device being
used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer
applied to the tool. As mentioned earlier, caution should be taken to avoid altering the state of a
mobile device when handling it, for example, by pressing keys that may corrupt or erase data.
Once the connection has been established, the forensic software suite or device may proceed to
acquire data from the mobile device.

The date and time maintained on the mobile device is an important piece of information. The
date and time may have been obtained from the network or manually set by the user. Owners
may manually set the day or time to different values from the actual ones yielding misleading
values in the call and message records found on the mobile device. If the device was on when
seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a reference clock should have
already been recorded. Nevertheless, confirmation at the time acquisition may prove useful. If
the mobile device was off when seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a
reference clock should be recorded immediately when first powered on. Actions taken during
acquisition, such as removal of the battery to view the device label, may affect the time and
date values.

Mobile devices may provide the user with an interface for a memory card. Mobile device
forensic tools that acquire the contents of a resident memory card normally perform a logical
acquisition. If the device is found in an active state, the mobile device internal memory should
be acquired before removing and performing a physical acquisition of the associated media
(e.g., microSD Card). Otherwise, if the device is found in a power off state, a physical
acquisition of the removable media should be performed before the internal handset memory
of the mobile device is acquired. With either type of acquisition, the forensic tool may or may
not have the capability to decode recovered data stored on the card (e.g., SMS text messages),
requiring additional manual steps to be taken.

After an acquisition is finished, the forensic specialist should confirm that the contents of a
device were captured correctly. On occasion, a tool may fail without any error notification and
require the specialist to reattempt acquisition. It is advisable to have multiple tools available
and be prepared to switch to another if difficulties occur with the initial tool.

Invariably, not all relevant data viewable on a mobile device using the available menus may be
acquired and decoded through a logical acquisition. Manually scrutinizing the contents via the
device interface menus while video recording the process not only allows such items to be
captured and reported, but also confirms that the contents reported by the tool are consistent
with observable data. Manual extraction must always be done with care, preserving the
integrity of the device in case further, more elaborate acquisitions are necessary.

The contents of a mobile device’s memory often contain information, such as deleted data, that
is not recoverable through either a logical or manual extractions. Lacking a software tool able
to perform a physical acquisition, it may be necessary to turn to hardware-based techniques.
Two techniques commonly used are acquisition through a standardized JTAG test interface, if

                                           41
                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      supported on the device, and acquisition by directly reading memory that has been removed
      from the device [Bro12].

5.3.1 GSM Mobile Device Considerations

      Mobile devices that do not require a UICC are relatively straightforward as the acquisition
      entails a single device. Mobile devices requiring UICCs are more complex. There are two
      items that must be examined: the handset and the UICC. Depending on the state of the mobile
      device (i.e., active, inactive) the handset and UICC may be acquired jointly or separately. It is
      generally accepted to process the UICC first while the device is in an inactive state.

      If the mobile device is active, a joint acquisition of the handset and UICC contents should be
      acquired first. A direct acquisition recovers deleted messages present on a UICC, while an
      indirect acquisition via the handset does not. The UICC must be removed from the mobile
      device and inserted into an appropriate reader for direct acquisition.

      A well-known forensic issue that arises when performing a joint acquisition is that the status of
      unread text messages change between acquisitions. The first acquisition may alter the status
      flag of an unread message to read. Reading an unread text message from a UICC indirectly
      through the handset causes the operating system of the device to change the status flags.
      UICCs that are read directly by a tool do not make these modifications. One way to avoid this
      issue is to omit selecting the recovery of UICC memory when performing the joint acquisition
      (if the tool allows such an option) [Rei08].

      If the mobile device is inactive, the contents of the UICC may be acquired independently
      before that of the handset. The UICC acquisition should be done directly through a PC/SC
      reader. The handset acquisition should be attempted without the UICC present. Many devices
      permit an acquisition under such conditions, allowing PIN entry for the UICC to be bypassed,
      if it were enabled. If the acquisition attempt is unsuccessful, the UICC may be reinserted and a
      second attempt made. Performing separate independent acquisitions (i.e., acquiring the UICC
      before acquiring the contents of the handset) avoids any operating system related forensic
      issues associated with an indirect read of UICC data. However, removing the SIM can
      reportedly cause data to be deleted on some mobile devices [Cas11].

5.3.2 iOS Device Considerations

      Since mid-2009, beginning with the release of the iPhone 3G[s], Apple has shipped all iOS
      devices with a dedicated cryptographic chip, making hardware accelerated encryption possible.
      Apple has incorporated this accelerated cryptography into the operating system, marketed as a
      feature named Data Protection. Data Protection is the combination of hardware-accelerated
      encryption and an authenticated cryptographic scheme, allowing any file or piece of
      information to be encrypted or decrypted with a separate key.

      Files protected with data protection are encrypted with a random file key, which is then
      encrypted using a higher tier class key, and stored as a file tag with the file. Passwords (and
      other sensitive small data) are stored on the device are encrypted using a similar approach, and
      are stored in the iOS keychain, a device key escrow mechanism built into the operating system.

      Files and keychain elements are both protected by one of a number of access control keys,
      which are also encrypted in a way that incorporates the user’s device passcode. The passcode

                                                 42
                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      must be known in order to decrypt the key hierarchy protecting these select files and keychain
      elements, and also to disable the device’s GUI lock.

      The implementation of Data Protection has been criticized for a number of design flaws and
      was originally exploited as shown by Zdziarski in 2009 [Zdz12]. Due to the simplicity of four-
      digit PINs or short passwords, brute forcing the device passcode is often a computationally
      feasible task. In many cases, brute forcing a four-digit PIN has shown to take at most 20
      minutes.

      Nevertheless, this encryption scheme poses significant challenges to the forensic investigator.
      The forensic examiner should be aware of these issues as well as the impact that this
      encryption has on any iOS based device presented for examination. Supported devices include
      iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 (both GSM and CDMA models), first-gen iPad, and latest releases
      of iPod Touch (3rd and 4th generation). All of these devices have the option to perform a
      remote wipe of data contained within them. When activated, the UID is destroyed and 256 bits
      of the key are destroyed leaving the examiner with an extremely complex decryption problem.
      To avoid such scenarios, it is recommended that radio communications are blocked or disabled
      prior to an examination as well as during transportation to the lab for examination.

      When data protection is active, the file key is obliterated when the file is deleted, leaving
      encrypted and generally unrecoverable file contents in unallocated space, which render
      traditional carving techniques for deleted files useless. Data however can often be found
      residing inside allocated data containers (i.e., SQLite Tables) and should not be discounted or
      ignored as part of any examination. Recovery of such data can be challenging as SQLite data
      recovery may be somewhat automated (e.g., epilog), often manual recovery may be the only
      option. Fortunately for the forensic investigator, a significant portion of user data is stored
      within allocated data containers and garbage collection is not generally performed on these
      containers.

      Apple also offers a feature to users to encrypt all backup data when using iTunes (iOS 4 and
      later). This option, when used will only present encrypted files from some forensic extraction
      tools. These backups can be decrypted using a brute force attack. Tools exist to perform this
      attack using GPU acceleration to facilitate a faster brute force attack. The backup encryption
      feature only applies to data sent through the device’s backup service, however a number of
      other services run on the device that provide clear text copies of data, even if backup
      encryption is active. If the acquisition tool is capable of communicating to these other services,
      a significant amount of clear text data can be recovered, even if the backup password is not
      known.

5.3.3 Android Device Considerations

      Android is an operating system designed by Google primarily for mobile devices such as
      smartphones and some tablet computers. Android was first released in 2007 and the first
      Android based phone was released in October 2008. The Android operating system is open
      source and Google releases a major version about once per year.

      Each one of the different versions of the operating system requires slight modifications for
      each family of device for full support. This has led to hundreds (if not thousands) of different
      distributions in the wild.


                                                 43
                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

        Much like Apple’s iTunes Store, Android has a main application repository called the Google
        Play Store. Analysis of submitted applications for soundness in the store are much lower and
        have resulted in many rogue applications making their way into the mainstream application
        pool. Dozens of other Android application repositories exist as well. This has led to thousands
        of applications that may be encountered by the examiner.

        Most of the Android user and application data will be found in SQLite tables located in
        separate folders for each installed application. This may require the examiner to dump all data
        contained in all SQLite tables and perform a search of the resultant data searching for relevant
        material as less than 5% of the applications are supported by the majority of mobile forensic
        tools.

        Since the operating system is designed for touch screen use, the default protection scheme for
        the device is a gesture password lock. The lock presents a 3X3 grid for the user to trace his/her
        finger connecting several cells of the grid to form a pattern. Once the correct pattern is traced,
        the phone is unlocked. Some forensics tools exist to obtain the gesture.key file to unlock the
        device.

        Most of the access methods for a locked Android device rely on debug mode to be active on
        the device to begin the forensics extraction process. A few tools have been released that can
        enable debug mode from a locked device; however, the number of supported models is very
        small.

        Most Android based mobile devices have removable microSD memory cards. The data
        contained on the microSD Card should not be overlooked as they frequently contain a great
        deal of unencrypted and unprotected data. As best practice, the microSD card should be write-
        blocked and imaged using standard digital forensic techniques. The image may then be
        examined using traditional digital forensic tools, as the media is generally a single partition
        formatted using exFAT.

        Getting into locked devices is also possible using JTAG methods and tools to obtain all of the
        data from the memory of the handset. This bypasses the locked USB port (USB Debugging
        turned off) and probes Test Access Ports between the USB Port and the CPU. JTAG provides
        communication to NAND memory through the CPU allowing memory to be read.

        Many tools are able to parse much of the information presented in the Android OS however all
        tools suffer the same problem as iOS based devices -- multitudes of applications. Hundreds of
        applications are added every week. Understanding and reverse engineering each one of them
        one-at-a-time is a time consuming process. Many vendors have chosen to focus on parsing the
        data from the more popular communication applications (e.g., WhatsApp, FaceBook, etc.).
        The more advanced examiner should be aware of this shortcoming and be prepared to perform
        testing and reverse engineering for some cases where support for specific applications may not
        yet exist.

5.3.4   UICC Considerations

        Similar to a mobile device, to acquire data from a UICC, a connection must be established
        from the forensic workstation to the UICC, using a PC/SC reader. As before, the version of the
        tool being used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the
        manufacturer applied to the tool. Once the connection has been established, the forensic
        software tool may proceed to acquire data from the UICC.
                                                   44
                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       Capturing a direct image of the UICC data is not possible because of the protection
       mechanisms built into the module. Instead, forensic tools send command directives called
       Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the UICC to extract data logically, without
       modification, from each elementary data file of the file system. The APDU protocol is a simple
       command-response exchange. Each element of the file system defined in the GSM standards
       has a unique numeric identifier assigned, which can be used to walk through the file system
       and recover data by referencing an element and performing some operation, such as reading its
       contents.

       Because UICCs are highly standardized devices, few issues exist with regard to a logical
       acquisition. The main consideration is selecting a tool that reports the status of any PINs and
       recovers the data of interest. Vast differences exist in the data recovered by UICC tools, with
       some recovering only the data thought to have the highest relevance in a typical investigation,
       and others performing a complete recovery of all data, even though much of it is network
       related with little investigative value.

 5.4   Tangential Equipment

       Tangential equipment includes devices that contain memory and are associated with a mobile
       device. The three main categories are memory cards, host computers to which a mobile device
       has synchronized its contents and cloud-based storage.

       Smartphones may provide an interface that supports removable media (e.g., microSD or
       MMC), which may contain significant amounts of data. Memory cards are typically flash
       memory, used as auxiliary user file storage, or as a means to convey files to and from the
       device. Data may be acquired with the use of a write-blocked media reader and a forensic
       application.

       The data contained on a mobile device is often present on a personal computer, due to the
       capability of mobile devices to synchronize or otherwise share information among one or more
       host computers. Such personal computers or workstations are referred to as synched devices.
       Because of synchronization, a significant amount of data on a mobile device may be present on
       the owner’s laptop or personal computer and recovered using a conventional computer
       forensic tool for hard drive acquisition and examination [Bad10].

5.4.1 Synched Devices

       Synchronization refers to the process of resolving differences in certain classes of data, such as
       e-mail residing on two devices (i.e., a mobile phone and a personal computer), to obtain a
       version that reflects any actions taken by the user (e.g., deletions or additions) on one device or
       the other. Synchronization of information may occur at either the record level or the file level.
       When done at the file level, any discrepancies from the last synchronization date and time
       result in the latest version automatically replacing the older version. Occasionally manual
       intervention may be needed if both versions were modified independently since the last
       synchronization occurred. Record level synchronization is done similarly, but with more
       granularity, whereby only out-of-date parts of a file are resolved and replaced.

       Mobile devices are typically populated with data from the personal computer during the
       synchronization process. A significant amount of informative data may reside locally on a
       personal computer. Data from the mobile device may also be synchronized to the computer,
       through user-defined preferences in the synchronization software. Because the synchronized
                                                  45
                                                                Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       contents of a mobile device and personal computer tend to diverge quickly over time,
       additional information may be found in one device or the other.

       The synchronization software and the device type determine where mobile device files are
       stored on the PC. Each synchronization protocol has a default installation directory, but the
       location may be user specified.

5.4.2 Memory Cards

       Memory card storage capacity ranges from 128MB and up. As technological advances are
       made, such media becomes physically smaller and offers larger storage densities. Removable
       media extends the storage capacity of mobile devices allowing individuals to store additional
       files beyond the device’s built-in capacity and to share data between compatible devices.

       Some forensics tools are able to acquire the contents of memory cards; many are not. If the
       acquisition is logical, deleted data present on the card is not recovered. Fortunately, such media
       can be treated similarly to a removable disk drive and imaged and analyzed using conventional
       forensic tools with the use of an external media reader.

       A physical acquisition of data present on removable media provides the examiner the potential
       to search the contents of the media and potentially recover deleted files. One drawback is that
       mobile device data, such as SMS text messages may require manual decoding or a separate
       decoding tool to interpret. A more serious issue is that content protection features incorporated
       into the card may block the recovery of data. For instance, BlackBerry™ devices provide the
       user with the ability to encrypt data contained on the removable media associated with the
       mobile device. Table 4 gives a brief overview of various storage media in use today.

 5.5   Cloud Based Services for Mobile Devices

       Mobile cloud computing is the combination of mobile networks and cloud computing allowing
       user applications and data to be stored on the cloud (i.e., internet servers) rather than the
       mobile device memory. This data may be stored across geographically diverse locations.
                                                  46
                                                       Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Cloud computing environments are complex in their design and frequently geographically
disperse. Often, storage locations for cloud computing are chosen due to lowest cost and data
redundancy requirements. One issue may be identification of the location of the data. This is
an emerging field.

Cloud storage opens numerous possibilities for mobile device application developers beyond
mobile device memory limitations. As mobile applications evolve data retrieval becomes
seamless to the user and not apparent if data is stored on the cloud or the internal memory of
the mobile device.

There are several factors within cloud computing environments that challenge forensics
examiners requiring a hybrid approach to include both live and “dead box” forensic
techniques. Additionally, recovery of user data stored in the cloud may become more
problematic based on laws and regulations. Retrieval and analysis of cloud based data should
follow agency specific guidelines on cloud forensics.

The mobile device forensics examiner should not discount cloud based data left behind (e.g.,
browser cache or other forensics artifacts) that may be present on tangential equipment
enabling an examiner to piece together what has occurred on a device.

                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


6. Examination and Analysis

       The examination process uncovers digital evidence, including that which may be hidden or
       obscured. The results are gained through applying established scientifically based methods and
       should describe the content and state of the data fully, including the source and the potential
       significance. Data reduction, separating relevant from irrelevant information, occurs once the
       data is exposed. The analysis process differs from examination in that it looks at the results of
       the examination for its direct significance and probative value to the case. Examination is a
       technical process that is the province of a forensic specialist. However, analysis may be done
       by roles other than a specialist, such as the investigator or the forensic examiner.

       The examination process begins with a copy of the evidence acquired from the mobile device.
       Fortunately, compared with classical examination of personal computers or network servers,
       the amount of acquired data to examine is much smaller with mobile devices. Because of the
       prevalence of proprietary case file formats, the forensic toolkit used for acquisition will
       typically be the one used for examination and analysis. While interoperability among the
       acquisition and examination facilities of different tools is possible, only a few tools support this
       feature. Examination and analysis using 3rd party tools are generally accomplished by
       importing a generated mobile device memory dump into a mobile forensics tool that supports
       3rd party mobile device images.

       The forensic examiner will need information about the case and the parties involved to provide
       a starting point for potential evidence that might be found. Conducting the examination is a
       partnership between the forensic analyst or examiner and the investigator. The investigator
       provides insight into the types of information sought, while the forensic examiner provides the
       means to find relevant information that might be on the system.

       The understanding gained by studying the case should provide ideas about the type of data to
       target and specific keywords or phrases to use when searching the acquired data. Depending
       on the type of case, the strategy varies. For example, a case about child pornography may
       begin with browsing all of the graphic images on the system, while a case about an Internet-
       related offense might begin with browsing all Internet history files.

 6.1   Potential Evidence

       Mobile device manufacturers typically offer a similar set of information handling features and
       capabilities, including Personal Information Management (PIM) applications, messaging and
       e-mail, and web browsing. The set of features and capabilities vary based on the era in which
       the device was manufactured, the version of firmware running, modifications made for a
       particular service provider, and any modifications or applications installed by the user. The
       potential evidence on these devices may include the following items:




                                                   48
                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       Subscriber and equipment                                 Audio and video recordings
        identifiers
                                                                 Multi-media messages
       Date/time, language, and
        other settings                                           Instant messaging

       Phonebook/Contact                                        Web browsing activities
        information
                                                                 Electronic documents
       Calendar information
                                                                 Social media related data
       Text messages
                                                                 Application related data
       Outgoing, incoming, and
        missed call logs                                         Location information

       Electronic mail                                          Geolocation data

       Photos

Even esoteric network information found on a UICC may prove useful in an investigation. For
example, if a network rejects a location update from a phone attempting to register itself, the
list of forbidden network entries in the Forbidden PLMNs (Public Land Mobile Networks)
elementary file is updated with the code of the country and network involved [3GP07]. This
list is maintained on the UICC and is due to service being declined by a foreign provider. The
mobile device of an individual suspected of traveling to a neighboring country might be
checked for this information.

The items present on a device are dependent not only on the features and capabilities of the
mobile device, but also on the voice and data services subscribed to by the user. For example,
prepaid phone service may rule out the possibility for multi-media messaging, electronic mail,
and web browsing. Similarly, a contract subscription may selectively exclude certain types of
service, though the phone itself may support them.

Two types of computer forensic investigations generally take place. The first type is where an
incident has occurred but the identity of the offender is unknown (e.g., a hacking incident). The
second is where the suspect and the incident are both known (e.g., a child-porn investigation).
Prepared with the background of the incident, the forensic examiner and analyst may proceed
toward accomplishing the following objectives:

       Gather information about the individual(s) involved {who}.

       Determine the exact nature of the events that occurred {what}.

       Construct a timeline of events {when}.

       Uncover information that explains the motivation for the offense {why}.

       Discover what tools or exploits were used {how}.

In many instances the data is peripheral to an investigation or useful in substantiating or
refuting the claims of an individual about some incident. On occasion, direct knowledge,
                                           49
                                                                            Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      motivation, and intention may be established. Most of the evidence sources from mobile
      devices are: contact data, call data, messaging, pictures, video, social media, or Internet-related
      information. User applications potentially provide other evidence sources. User files placed on
      the device for rendering, viewing, or editing are other important evidence sources. Besides
      graphic files, other relevant file content includes audio and video recordings, spreadsheets,
      presentation slides, and other similar electronic documents.

      Installed executable programs may also have relevance in certain situations. Often times the
      most important data recovered is that which links to information held by the service provider.
      Service providers maintain databases for billing or debiting accounts based on call logs, which
      can be queried using the subscriber or equipment identifiers. Similarly, undelivered SMS text
      messages, multi-media, or voice messages may also be recoverable. This may allow an
      examiner to validate their findings as the data obtained from the device may be verified with
      the data obtained from the service provider.


           Enhanced 911: Enhanced 911 (E911) is a technology advanced by the U.S. Federal
           Communications Commission (FCC) enabling mobile devices to process 911 calls and to provide
           the geographic location of the handset. Therefore, all U.S. based mobile devices possess the
           ability to establish cellular voice communication when dialing 911 regardless of their service status
           (i.e., active, inactive). Additionally, GSM and other UICC dependent devices may also establish
           cellular voice communication by dialing 911 without the presence of a UICC.

           All U.S. based cellular carriers are required to handle calls regardless of the mobile device
           customer's specific carrier. Under the rules, all mobile devices manufactured for sale in the United
           States after February 13, 2000, that are capable of operating in an analog mode, including dual-
                                                                                                       22
           mode and multi-mode handsets, must include this special method for processing 911 calls .

           In situations where 911 was dialed on a mobile device, the location information (i.e., the latitude
           and longitude of the device or cell tower) for the call may be of interest to a forensic investigator.
           Outgoing 911 calls may or may not be logged in the memory of the mobile device or UICC.




6.2   Applying Mobile Device Forensic Tools

      Once a copy of the acquisition results are available, the next steps involve searching the data,
      identifying evidence, creating bookmarks, and developing the contents of a final report.
      Knowledge and experience with the tools used for examination are extremely valuable, since
      proficient use of the available features and capabilities of a forensic tool can greatly speed the
      examination process.

      It is important to note that forensic tools have the potential to contain some degree of error in
      their operation. For example, the implementation of the tool may have a programming error;
      the specification of a file structure used by the tool to translate bits into data comprehensible by
      the examiner may be inaccurate or out of date; or the file structure generated by another
      program as input may be incorrect, causing the tool to function improperly. Experiments
      conducted with mobile device forensic tools indicate a prevalence of errors in the formatting

                                                          Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

and display of data [Aye11, Jan09]. Therefore, having a high degree of trust and understanding
of the tool’s ability to perform its function properly is essential. The Computer Forensics Tool
Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) produces
specification, test methods and test reports that provide a foundation for toolmakers to improve
tools, users to make informed choices, and provide interested parties with an overview of any
anomalies found. CFTT has spent several years researching and testing forensic tools capable
of acquiring data from the internal memory of mobile devices and Subscriber Identity Modules
(SIMs).

A knowledgeable individual may tamper with device information, such as purposefully
modifying a file extension to foil the workings of a tool, altering the date/time of the mobile
device to falsify timestamps associated with logged activities, creating false transactions in the
memory of the mobile device or its UICC or utilizing a wiping tool to remove or eliminate data
from memory. Seasoned experience with a tool provides an understanding of its limitations,
allowing an examiner to compensate for them and minimize errors to achieve the best possible
results.

To uncover evidence, specialists should gain a background of the suspect, offense and
determine a set of terms for the examination. Search expressions should be developed in a
systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By proceeding
systematically, the specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable
findings. Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence – A Guide for Law Enforcement,
produced by the U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ08], offers the following suggestions for the
analysis of extracted data:

       Ownership and possession – Identify the individuals who created, modified, or
        accessed a file, and the ownership and possession of questioned data by placing the
        subject with the device at a particular time and date, locating files of interest in non-
        default locations, recovering passwords that indicate possession or ownership, and
        identifying contents of files that are specific to a user.

       Application and file analysis – Identify information relevant to the investigation by
        examining file content, correlating files to installed applications, identifying
        relationships between files (e.g., e-mail files to e-mail attachments), determining the
        significance of unknown file types, examining system configuration settings, and
        examining file metadata (e.g., documents containing authorship identification).

       Timeframe analysis – Determine when events occurred on the system to associate
        usage with an individual by reviewing any logs present and the date/time stamps in
        the file system, such as the last modified time. Besides call logs, the date/time and
        content of messages and e-mail can prove useful. Such data can also be corroborated
        with billing and subscriber records kept by the service provider.

       Data hiding analysis – Detect and recover hidden data that may indicate knowledge,
        ownership, or intent by correlating file headers to file extensions to show intentional
        obfuscation; gaining access to password-protected, encrypted, and compressed files;
        gaining access to steganographic information detected in images; and gaining access
        to reserved areas of data storage outside the normal file system.

The capabilities of the tool and the richness of its features, versus the operating system and
type of device under examination, determines what information can be recovered, identified,
                                           51
                                                                          Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      and reported, and the amount of effort needed. The search engine plays a significant role in the
      discovery of information used for the creation of bookmarks and final reporting. For example,
      some tools used to search for textual evidence identify and categorize files based on file
      extension, where others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it
      eliminates the possibility of missing data because of an inconsistent file name extension (e.g.,
      eliminating a text file whose extension was changed to that of a graphics or image file).
      Similarly, the ability for the tool to find and gather images automatically into a common
      graphics library for examination is extremely useful.

      Searching data for information on incriminating or exculpatory evidence takes patience and
      can be time consuming. Some tools have a simple search engine that matches an input text
      string exactly, allowing only for elementary searches to be performed. Other tools incorporate
      more intelligent and feature rich search engines, allowing for generalized regular expression
      patterns (grep) type searches, including wildcard matches, filtering of files by extension,
      directory and batch scripts that search for specific types of content (e.g., e-mail addresses,
      URLs). The greater the tool’s capabilities, the more the forensic examiner benefits from
      experience with and knowledge of the tool.


6.3   Call and Subscriber Records

      Records maintained by the service provider capture information needed to accurately bill a
      subscriber or, in the case of a prepaid service plan, debit the balance. The records collected are
      referred to as call detail records (CDRs), which are generated by the switch handling an
      originating call or SMS message from a mobile device. For some service providers, the records
      may also include fixed line, international gateway, and voice over IP transaction information.
      While the content and format of these records differ widely from one service provider to
      another, the fundamental data needed to identify the subscriber/device initiating the call, the
      initial cell servicing the call, the number dialed, and the duration of the call is captured.
      Detailed information such as the identifier of the cell (i.e., the BTS) and the sector involved are
      often included. Appendix C gives an example of the data elements of a CDR, specified in the
      GSM standards [ETS99]. As one can see, considerable discretion about what is implemented
      is left open to the service providers and network operators.

      The retention period for maintaining call detail and other types of records varies among service
      providers [GSM05]. However, the period is generally limited, requiring immediate action to
      avoid data loss. One should act quickly to have the cellular carrier preserve any data that can
      be used to identify communications that have occurred and are linked to the parties of interest,
      stressing non-disclosure of that action to the account subscriber [Ala03, Ala04]. The data
      available may include subscriber records, the content of email servers (i.e., undelivered email),
      email server logs, or other IP address authentication logs, the content of SMS and MMS
      message servers, and the content of voicemail servers. Note that certain types of undelivered
      content, such as voicemail, may be considered in transit from a legal standpoint in some
      jurisdictions, and obtaining or listening to them without the proper authority may be treated as
      an illegal interception of communications [Ala03]. While the USA PATRIOT Act eliminated
      this issue at the federal level, state statutes may be intentionally more restrictive or not yet be
      realigned completely with the federal statute.23

For example, CDRs will contain information such as: sender and receiver phone numbers,
time and duration of the call, call type (i.e., voice, SMS), etc. CDRs may be obtained from
U.S. service providers through their law enforcement point of contact, with the appropriate
legal documentation. Procedures may vary among states in the U.S., and new laws regarding
proper seizure are continually legislated. Procedures also vary for getting records from service
providers and network operators located in other countries. Close and continuing consultation
with legal counsel is advised. Various online law enforcement forums can also be helpful in
identifying points of contact and sharing tips on procedures for accurately obtaining the
required data.24

Besides call detail records, subscriber records maintained by a service provider can provide
data useful in an investigation. For example, for GSM systems, the database usually contains
the following information about each customer [Wil03]:

         Customer name and address

         Billing name and address (if other than customer)

         User name and address (if other than customer)

         Billing account details

         Telephone number (MSISDN)

         IMSI

         UICC serial number (ICCID)

         PIN/PUK for the UICC

         Services allowed

Other useful information, including phone numbers (i.e., work or home), contact information
(e.g., email address), and credit card numbers used, may also be retained in subscriber records.
Pay-as-you-go prepaid phones purchased anonymously over the counter may also have useful
information maintained with their accounts, which was supplied by the subscribers, such as the
credit card numbers used for purchases of additional time or an email address registered online
for receipt of notifications. Gaining access to the call records of prepaid phones should not be
ruled out.

CDRs and other records maintained by the service provider can be requested using subscriber
or equipment identifier information seized or acquired from a mobile device or UICC.
Subscriber information often used for this purpose includes the IMSI from the UICC and the
mobile device number (i.e., MSISDN). Equipment identifiers used are the ESN or IMEI of the
phone and the serial number (i.e., ICCID) of the UICC. The search criteria used could be, for
example, all calls received by a certain phone number (e.g., that of a victim) or all calls
handled by a base station responsible for a particular cell (i.e., to determine who was in a

certain area at a certain time) [Wil03]. The analysis of the initial set of records obtained usually
leads to additional requests for related records of other subscribers and equipment, based on
the data uncovered. For example, frequent calls to a victim’s mobile device from one or more
other mobile devices before a homicide would logically lead to interest in obtaining the records
of the caller(s).

CDRs can be analyzed for a variety of purposes. For example, a service provider may use
them to understand the calling patterns of their subscribers and the performance of the network
[Aja06]. Call detail records can also be used with cell site tower information obtained from the
service provider to translate cell identifiers into geographical locations for the cells involved
and identify the general locale from which calls were placed. While plotting call record
locations and information onto a map can sometimes be useful, it does not necessarily provide
a complete and accurate picture. Cell towers can service phones at distances of up to 35
kilometers (approximately 21 miles) and may service several distinct sectors. Radio frequency
coverage maps maintained by the service provider can be obtained to create a more exact
portrayal of the data for the sectors involved. The results of the data analysis can be used to
determine the location of the mobile device at a given time [Oco09]. The analysis can also help
to establish timelines and identify possible co-conspirators [Mil08]. A change of cell identifier
between the beginning and the end of a call, over a series of calls, may also indicate a general
direction of travel or pattern of behavior.

The boundaries of a cell are somewhat variable. Various factors, such as terrain, seasonal
changes, antenna performance, and call loading, affect the coverage area of cells and the
plausible locale to associate with a call record. Detailed field tests and measurements may be
required to ensure an accurate analysis. Tools exist to aid law enforcement in performing cell
site analysis and mapping activities independently. In some situations, such as densely
populated urban locations involving microcells or picocells with a limited coverage area,
location determination may be relatively straightforward by the very nature of the network.

Identifying the geographical coverage of specific cells may provide valuable information when
combined with call detail records, geographically establishing plausible locations with some
degree of certainty for the times involved. Professional criminals are aware of these
capabilities and may attempt to turn them to their advantage by having someone use their
mobile device to establish a false alibi. Attempts at evasion may also occur. A common ploy
used is to purchase, use, and quickly dispose of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones to minimize
exposure or use stolen phones. To obfuscate usage and complicate analysis of records, a
variety of different UICCs may be swapped among different GSM/UMTS mobile devices.

Careful analysis of the call records in conjunction with other forms of available data may be
useful establishing the relationship between the mobile device and its owner. For example, call
detail records of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones are maintained by and available from network
providers, the same as for contract subscriptions. By analyzing the patterns and content of
communications and mapping the dat to known associates of a suspect, ownership of such
phones is possible to establish. Other traditional forms of forensic evidence (e.g.,
fingerprinting, DNA) may also be used to establish ownership.

Network traffic information quantifying the amount of data transferred to/from the device is
also frequently reported and may aid an investigator in specific investigations.

7. Reporting

     Reporting is the process of preparing a detailed summary of all the steps taken and conclusions
     reached in the investigation of a case. Reporting depends on maintaining a careful record of all
     actions and observations, describing the results of tests and examinations, and explaining the
     inferences drawn from the data. A good report relies on solid documentation, notes,
     photographs and tool-generated content.

     Reporting occurs once the data has been thoroughly searched and relevant items bookmarked.
     Many forensic tools come with a built-in reporting facility that usually follows predefined
     templates and may allow customization of the report structure. Permitted customizations
     include allowing for organization logos and report headers and selection of styles and structure
     to provide a more professional look tailored to the organization’s needs. Reports generated by
     a forensic tool typically include items from the case file, such as the specialist’s name, a case
     number, a date and title, the categories of evidence, and the relevant evidence found. Report
     generation typically either outputs all of the data obtained or allows examiners to select
     relevant data (i.e., bookmarked items) for the final report. Including only relevant findings in
     the report minimizes its size and lessens confusion for the reader.

     The software-generated contents are only one part of the overall report. The final report
     contains the software-generated contents along with data accumulated throughout the
     investigation that summarizes the actions taken, the analysis done, and the relevance of the
     evidence uncovered. Ideally, the supporting documentation is in electronic form and able to be
     incorporated directly into the report.

     Reporting facilities vary significantly across mobile device acquisition applications. Report
     generation typically can render a complete report in one of several common formats (e.g., .txt,
     .csv, .doc, .html, .pdf) or at least provide a means to export out individual data items to
     compose a report manually. A few tools include no means of report generation or data export
     and instead require examiners to capture individual screenshots of the tool interface for later
     assembly into a report format. Regardless of how reports are generated, checking that the
     finalized report is consistent with the data presented in the user interface representation is vital
     to identify and eliminate any possible inconsistencies that may appear [Aye11].

     The ability to modify a pre-existing report and incorporate data (e.g., images, video stills)
     captured by alternative means is advantageous. Auxiliary acquisition techniques are sometime
     required to recover specific data types, as mentioned earlier. For example, video recording a
     manual examination documents the recovery of data that the automated forensic tool may not
     have acquired. Video editing software allows still images to be captured for inclusion into the
     report. Pictures could also be taken of the manual exam using a digital camera; though this
     process is less efficient and may not document the entire process, it may be the only method
     available.

     The type of data determines whether it is presentable in a hard-copy format. Today, many
     popular mobile devices are capable of capturing audio and video. Such evidentiary data (e.g.,
     audio, video) cannot easily be presented in a printed format and instead should be included
     with the finalized report on removable media (e.g., CD-R, DVD-R, or flash drive) along with
     the appropriate application for proper display.

Reports of forensic examination results should include all the information necessary to identify
the case and its source, outline the test results and findings, and bear the signature of the
individual responsible for its contents. In general, the report may include the following
information [DOJ08]:

       Identity of the reporting agency

       Case identifier or submission number

       Case investigator

       Identity of the submitter

       Date of evidence receipt

       Date of report

       Descriptive list of items submitted for examination, including serial number, make,
        and model

       Identity and signature of the examiner

       The equipment and set up used in the examination

       Brief description of steps taken during examination, such as string searches, graphics
        image searches, and recovering erased files.

       Supporting materials such as printouts of particular items of evidence, digital copies of
        evidence, and chain of custody documentation

       Details of findings:

            Specific files related to the request

            Other files, including deleted files, that support the findings

            String searches, keyword searches, and text string searches

            Internet-related evidence, such as Web site traffic analysis, chat logs, cache files,
             e-mail, and news group activity

            Graphic image analysis

            Indicators of ownership, which could include program registration data

            Data analysis

            Description of relevant programs on the examined items

            Techniques used to hide or mask data, such as encryption, steganography, hidden
             attributes, hidden partitions and file name anomalies

                                            56

       Report conclusions

Digital evidence, as well as the tools, techniques and methodologies used in an examination is
subject to being challenged in a court of law or other formal proceedings. Proper
documentation is essential in providing individuals the ability to re-create the process from
beginning to end. As part of the reporting process, making a copy of the software used and
including it with the output produced is advisable when custom tools are used for examination
or analysis, should it become necessary to reproduce forensic processing results.
