                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) of 2002, P.L. 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

  Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to
  describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
  recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor is it
  intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the
  purpose.
  There are references in this publication to documents currently under development by NIST in
  accordance with responsibilities assigned to NIST under the Federal Information Security Management
  Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive #12. These include: NIST Special
  Publication 800-53A, FIPS 200, and FIPS 201. The methodologies in this document may be used even
  before the completion of the aforementioned companion documents. Thus, until such time as each
  document is completed, current requirements, guidelines and procedures (where they exist) remain
  operative. For planning and transition purposes, agencies may wish to closely follow the development
  of these new documents by NIST. Individuals are also encouraged to review the public draft
  documents and offer their comments to NIST. All NIST documents mentioned in this publication other
  than the ones noted above, are available at: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR SECURITY CONTROLS TO PROTECT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

        he selection and employment of appropriate security controls for an information system1 is

T       an important task that can have major implications on the operations2 and assets of an
        organization. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards
or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the system and its information. There are several important questions that
should be answered by organizational officials when addressing the security considerations for
their information systems:
•      What security controls are needed to adequately protect the information systems that support
       the operations and assets of the organization in order to accomplish its assigned mission,
       protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and
       protect individuals?
•      Have the selected security controls been implemented or is there a realistic plan for their
       implementation?
•      What is the desired or required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the
       selected security controls, as implemented, are effective3 in their application?

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
information security program for the organization that identifies, controls, and mitigates risks to
its information and information systems.4 The security controls defined in Special Publication
800-53 and recommended for use by organizations in protecting their information systems should
be employed in conjunction with and as part of a well-defined information security program. An
effective information security program should include—
•      Periodic assessments of risk, including the magnitude of harm that could result from the
       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information
       and information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization;
•      Policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments, cost-effectively reduce
       information security risks to an acceptable level, and ensure that information security is
       addressed throughout the life cycle of each organizational information system;
•      Subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities,
       information systems, or groups of information systems, as appropriate;
1
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
2
    Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.
3
  Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
4
  The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) passed by the one hundred and seventh Congress and signed into law by the
President in December 2002 recognized the importance of information security to the economic and national security
interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide information security for the information systems that support its operations and
assets.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


•   Security awareness training to inform personnel (including contractors and other users of
    information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization) of the
    information security risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in
    complying with organizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks;
•   Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies,
    procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on
    risk, but no less than annually;
•   A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to
    address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the
    organization;
•   Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and
•   Plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information systems that support
    the operations and assets of the organization.

It is of paramount importance that responsible individuals within the organization understand the
risks and other factors that could adversely affect their operations and assets. Moreover, these
officials must understand the current status of their security programs and the security controls
planned or in place to protect their information systems in order to make informed judgments and
investments that appropriately mitigate risks to an acceptable level. The ultimate objective is to
conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and to accomplish the organization’s stated
missions with what the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 defines as
adequate security, or security commensurate with risk, including the magnitude of harm resulting
from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of
information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines apply to all components5 of an information system that process, store, or transmit
federal information. The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure
information systems within the federal government by:
•   Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
    specifying security controls for information systems;
•   Providing a recommendation for minimum security controls for information systems
    categorized in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199,
    Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems;
•   Promoting a dynamic, extensible catalog of security controls for information systems to meet
    the demands of changing requirements and technologies; and
•   Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
    determining security control effectiveness.

5
  Information system components include, but are not limited to, mainframes, servers, workstations, network
components, operating systems, middleware, and applications. Network components can include such devices as
firewalls, switches, routers, gateways, wireless access points, and network appliances. Servers can include database
servers, authentication servers, electronic mail and web servers, proxy servers, domain name servers, and network time
servers. Information system components are either purchased commercially off-the-shelve or are custom developed.

Special Publication 800-53                              Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


The guidelines provided in this special publication are applicable to all federal information
systems other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C.,
Section 3542.6 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to
complement similar guidelines for national security systems. This publication is intended to
provide guidance to federal agencies until the publication of FIPS 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems (projected for publication
December 2005). In addition to the agencies of the federal government, state, local, and tribal
governments, and private sector organizations that compose the critical infrastructure of the
United States, are encouraged to consider the use of these guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse federal audience of information system and
information security professionals including: (i) individuals with information system and
information security management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., chief information officers,
senior agency information security officers, and authorizing officials); (ii) individuals with
information system development responsibilities (e.g., program and project managers); (iii)
individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
information system owners, information owners, information system security officers); and (iv)
individuals with information system and information security assessment and monitoring
responsibilities (e.g., auditors, inspectors general, evaluators, and certification agents).
Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating
information security-related technologies, and providing information security services can also
benefit from the information in this publication.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create the most technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for
information systems, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this special
publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial, healthcare,
and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by national and international standards
organizations.7 The objective of NIST Special Publication 800-53 is to provide a sufficiently rich
set of security controls that satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements8 levied on
information systems and that are consistent with and complementary to other established security
standards.

The catalog of security controls provided in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to
demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security

6
 NIST Special Publication 800-59 provides guidance on identifying an information system as a national security
system.
7
 Security controls from the audit, defense, healthcare, intelligence, and standards communities are contained in the
following publications: (i) General Accounting Office, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual; (ii)
Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation; (iii) Department of Health and
Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Core Security Requirements; (iv) Director of Central
Intelligence Directive 6/3 Manual, Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information within Information Systems; (v)
NIST Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems; and (vi)
International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 17799:2000, Code of
Practice for Information Security Management.
8
  Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, executive
orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.

requirements. It is the responsibility of organizations to select the appropriate security controls9,
to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in
satisfying their stated security requirements. The security controls in the catalog facilitate the
development of assessment methods and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control
effectiveness in a consistent and repeatable manner—thus contributing to the organization’s
confidence that there is ongoing compliance with its stated security requirements.10

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations should use FIPS 199 to define security categories for their information systems.
This publication associates recommended minimum security controls with FIPS 199 low-impact,
moderate-impact, and high-impact security categories. The recommendations for minimum
security controls from Special Publication 800-53 can subsequently be used as a starting point for
and input to the organization’s risk assessment process.11 The risk assessment process refines the
initial set of minimum security controls with the resulting set of agreed-upon controls
documented in the security plans for those information systems. While the FIPS 199 security
categorization associates the operation of the information system with the potential impact on an
organization’s operations and assets, the incorporation of refined threat and vulnerability
information during the risk assessment process facilitates the tailoring of the baseline security
controls to address organizational needs and tolerance for risk. Deviations from the
recommended baseline security controls should be made in accordance with the scoping guidance
provided in this special publication and documented with appropriate justification and supporting
rationale in the security plan for the information system. The use of security controls from
Special Publication 800-53 and the incorporation of baseline (minimum) controls as a starting
point in the control selection process, facilitates a more consistent level of security in an
organizational information system. It also offers the needed flexibility to tailor the controls based
on specific organizational policy and requirements documents, particular conditions and
circumstances, known threat and vulnerability information, or tolerance for risk to the
organization’s operations and assets.

Building a more secure information system is a multifaceted undertaking that involves the use of:
(i) well-defined system-level security requirements and security specifications; (ii) well-designed
information technology component products; (iii) sound systems/security engineering principles
and practices to effectively integrate component products into the information system; (iv)
appropriate methods for product/system testing and evaluation; and (v) comprehensive system
security planning and life cycle management.12 From a systems engineering viewpoint, security is

9
  NIST Special Publication 800-53 is the primary source of recommended security controls for federal information
systems, replacing the security controls described in NIST Special Publications 800-18 and 800-26. Future versions of
Special Publication 800-18 will eliminate the listing of security controls and reference Special Publication 800-53. The
self-assessment questionnaire in Special Publication 800-26 will be updated to align with Special Publication 800-53.
10
   NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (initial
public draft, spring 2005), provides guidance on assessment methods and procedures for security controls defined in
this publication. Special Publication 800-53A can also be used to conduct self-assessments of information systems.
11
   Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the organization. The
assessment of risk is a process that should be incorporated into the system development life cycle, and the process
should be reasonable for the organization concerned. NIST Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on the assessment of risk.
12
   Successful life cycle management depends on having qualified personnel to oversee and manage the information
systems within an organization. The skills and knowledge of organizational personnel with information systems (and
information security) responsibilities should be carefully evaluated (e.g., through performance, certification, and
experience).

just one of many required capabilities for an organizational information system—capabilities that
must be funded by the organization throughout the life cycle of the system. Realistically
assessing the risks to an organization’s operations and assets by placing the information system
into operation or continuing its operation is of utmost importance. Addressing the information
system security requirements must be accomplished with full consideration of the risk tolerance
of the organization and the cost, schedule, and performance issues associated with the acquisition,
deployment, and operation of the system.

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE




T       his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
        and specification including: (i) the structure of security controls and the organization of the
        controls in the control catalog; (ii) the identification and use of common security controls;
(iii) the application of minimum security controls, or control baselines, to information systems
categorized in accordance with FIPS 199; (iv) security control assurance; and (v) future revisions

2.1 SECURITY CONTROL ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
Security controls in the security control catalog (Appendix F) have a well-defined organization
and structure. The security controls are organized into classes and families for ease of use in the
control selection and specification process. There are three general classes of security controls
(i.e., management, operational, and technical).13 Each family contains security controls related to
the security function of the family. A two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify
each control family. Table 1 summarizes the classes and families in the security control catalog
and the associated family identifiers.

                     TABLE 1: SECURITY CONTROL CLASSES, FAMILIES, AND IDENTIFIERS



13
   Security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are associated with one of three security control classes
(i.e., management, operational, technical). Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant
characteristics of the controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more
than one class. For example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the Contingency Planning, family is listed
as an operational control but also has characteristics that are consistent with security management as well.



                                                        PAGE 6
Special Publication 800-53                            Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


To uniquely identify each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to
indicate the number of the control within the control family. For example, CP-9 is the ninth
control in the Contingency Planning family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. The following example
from the Contingency Planning family illustrates the structure of a typical security control.
CP-9     INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP

         Control: The organization conducts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] backups of user-
         level and system-level information (including system state information) contained in the
         information system and stores backup information at an appropriately secured location.
         Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of
         backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the
         organization’s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure
               media reliability and information integrity.
         (2)   The organization selectively uses backup information in the restoration of information system
               functions as part of contingency plan testing.
         (3)   The organization stores backup copies of the operating system and other critical information
               system software in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not co-located with the
               operational software.


The control section provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to
protect a particular aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific
security-related activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information
system. For some controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing
organizations to selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the
controls. This flexibility is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations
within the main body of the control. Assignment and selection operations provide an opportunity
for an organization to tailor the security controls to support specific mission, business, or
operational needs. For example, an organization can specify how often it intends to conduct
information system backups or how frequently it intends to test its contingency plan. Once
specified, the organization-defined value becomes part of the control, and the organization is
assessed against the completed control statement. Some assignment operations may specify
minimum or maximum values that constrain the values that may be input by the organization.
Selection statements also narrow the potential input values by providing a specific list of items
from which the organization must choose.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations should consider supplemental guidance when defining, developing, and
implementing security controls. Applicable federal legislation, executive orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST
Special Publications) are listed in the supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the
particular security control.

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a



                                                       PAGE 7
Special Publication 800-53                            Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control. In the example above, if two of the three control
enhancements are selected, the control designation subsequently becomes CP-9 (1) (2).

2.2 COMMON SECURITY CONTROLS
An organization-wide view of an information security program facilitates the identification of
common security controls that can be applied to one or more organizational information systems.
Common security controls can apply to: (i) all organizational information systems; (ii) a group of
information systems at a specific site; or (iii) common information systems, subsystems, or
applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational
sites. Common security controls have the following properties:
•   The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls can be assigned
    to responsible organizational officials or organizational elements (other than the information
    system owners whose systems will implement or use the common security controls); and
•   The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to support the
    security certification and accreditation processes of organizational information systems where the
    controls have been applied.14

The identification of common security controls is most effectively accomplished as an
organization-wide exercise with the involvement of the Chief Information Officer, senior agency
information security officer, authorizing officials, information system owners/program managers,
and information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the classes of
information systems within the organization in accordance with FIPS 199 (i.e., low-impact,
moderate-impact, or high-impact systems) and the minimum security controls necessary to
protect those systems (see baseline security controls in Section 2.3). For example, common
security controls can be identified for all low-impact information systems by considering the
baseline security controls for that class of information system. Similar exercises can be
conducted for moderate-impact and high-impact systems as well.

Many of the security controls needed to protect an information system (e.g., contingency planning
controls, incident response controls, security training and awareness controls, personnel security
controls, physical and environmental protection controls, and intrusion detection controls) may be
excellent candidates for common security control status. By centrally managing the development,
implementation, and assessment of the common security controls designated by the organization,
security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems. Security controls not
designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls and are the responsibility
of the information system owner. Security plans for individual information systems should
clearly identify which security controls have been designated by the organization as common
security controls and which controls have been designated as system-specific controls.

Organizations may also assign a hybrid status to security controls in situations where one part of
the control is deemed to be common, while another part of the control is deemed to be system-
specific. For example, an organization may view the IR-1 (Incident Response Policy and
Procedures) security control as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control deemed to
be common and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be system-specific. Hybrid

systems.

security controls may also serve as templates for further control refinement. An organization may
choose, for example, to implement the CP-2 (Contingency Planning) security control as a master
template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with
individual information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific
issues.

Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific issues associated with the
implementation of an organization’s common security controls. These issues are identified and
described in the system security plans for the individual information systems. The senior agency
information security officer, acting on behalf of the Chief Information Officer, should coordinate
with organizational officials (e.g., facilities managers, site managers, personnel managers)
responsible for the development and implementation of the designated common security controls
to ensure that the required controls are put into place, the controls are assessed, and the
assessment results are shared with the appropriate information system owners.

Partitioning security controls into common security controls and system-specific security controls
can result in significant savings to the organization in control development and implementation
costs. It can also result in a more consistent application of the security controls across the
organization at large. Moreover, equally significant savings can be realized in the security
certification and accreditation process. Rather than assessing common security controls in every
information system, the certification process draws upon any applicable results from the most
current assessment of the common security controls performed at the organization level. An
organization-wide approach to reuse and sharing of assessment results can greatly enhance the
efficiency of the security certifications and accreditations being conducted by organizations and
significantly reduce security program costs.

While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls and system-
specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this principle within an
organization takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an organization is just beginning
to implement this approach or has only partially implemented this approach, it may take some
time to get the maximum benefits from security control partitioning and the associated reuse of
assessment evidence. Because of the potential dependence on common security controls by many
of an organization’s information systems, a failure of such common controls may result in a
significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that arises from the operation of the systems that
depend on these controls.

2.3 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations must employ security controls to meet security requirements defined by laws,
executive orders, directives, policies, or regulations (e.g., Federal Information Security
Management Act, OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III).15 The challenge for organizations is to
determine the appropriate set of security controls, which if implemented and determined to be
effective in their application, would comply with the stated security requirements. Selecting the
appropriate set of security controls to meet the specific, and sometimes unique, security
requirements of an organization is an important task—a task that demonstrates the organization’s


15
  An information system may require security controls at different layers within the system. For example, an operating
system or network component typically provides an identification and authentication capability. An application
running on that operating system or network may also provide its own identification and authentication capability
rendering an additional level of protection for the overall information system. The selection and specification of
security controls should consider components at all layers within the information system.



                                                       PAGE 9

commitment to security and the due diligence exercised in protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of their information and information systems.

To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for their
information systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the
minimum security controls recommended for an information system based on the system’s
security categorization in accordance with FIPS 199.16 Security categories derived from FIPS
199 are typically considered during the risk assessment process to help guide the initial selection
of security controls for an information system.17 The risk assessment process provides useful
information and a procedural approach to examining the important factors that ultimately
determine which security controls are necessary to protect the organization’s operations and
assets. The baseline controls associated with the FIPS 199 security categories serve as a starting
point for organizations in determining the appropriate safeguards and countermeasures necessary
to protect their information systems. Because the baselines are intended to be broadly applicable
starting points, modifications to the selected baseline may be necessary in order to achieve
adequate risk mitigation. Such modifications are tied to the risk assessment and documented in
the security plan for the information system.

Appendix D provides a listing of minimum security controls. Three sets of minimum security
(baseline) controls have been identified corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and
high-impact levels defined in the security categorization process in FIPS 199 and derived in
Section 3.2 below. Each of the three baselines provides a minimum set of security controls (or
floor) for a particular impact level associated with a security category. Appendix F provides the
complete catalog of security controls for information systems, arranged by control families. The
catalog represents the entire set of security controls defined at this time. Chapter 3 provides
additional information on how to use security categories to select the appropriate set of baseline
security controls.

2.4 SECURITY CONTROL ASSURANCE
Assurance is the grounds for confidence that the security controls implemented within an
information system are effective in their application. Assurance can be obtained in a variety of
ways including: (i) actions taken by developers and implementers of security controls to use state-
of-the-practice design, development, and implementation techniques and methods; and (ii) actions
taken by security control assessors during the testing and evaluation process to determine the
extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Assurance
considerations related to developers and implementers of security controls are addressed in this
special publication. Assurance considerations related to assessors of security controls (including
certification agents, evaluators, auditors, inspectors general) are addressed in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.18

16
  FIPS 199 security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur which
jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned mission,
protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.
17
   Security categories are used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an
organization by operating an information system. FIPS 199 defines three levels of potential impact on organizations or
individuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). The application
of these definitions takes place within the context of each organization and the overall national interest.
18
  Initial public draft of NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
Information Systems, is projected for publication in the spring 2005.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for security controls listed in the low,
moderate, and high baselines. For security controls in the low baseline, the emphasis is on the
control being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are
discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner. For security controls in the moderate baseline,
the emphasis is on ensuring control correctness. While flaws are still likely to be uncovered (and
addressed expeditiously), the control developer or control implementer incorporates, as part of the
control, specific capabilities to ensure the control meets its function or purpose. For security
controls in the high baseline, the emphasis is on requiring within the control, the capabilities that
are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the control and to support continuous
improvement in the control’s effectiveness. There are additional assurance requirements
available to developers and implementers supplementing the minimum assurance requirements
for the high baseline in order to protect against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and
well-financed threat agents. This level of protection is required for those information systems
where the organization is not willing to accept the risks associated with the type of threat agents
cited above.

2.5 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The set of security controls listed in the control catalog represents the current state-of-the-practice
safeguards and countermeasures for information systems. The security controls will be revised
and extended to reflect: (i) the experience gained from using the controls; (ii) the changing
security requirements within organizations; and (iii) new security technologies that may be
available. The controls populating the various families are expected to change over time, as
controls are eliminated or revised and new controls are added. The proposed additions, deletions,
or modifications to the catalog of security controls will go through a rigorous, public review
process to obtain government and private sector feedback and to build consensus for the changes.
The minimum security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high baselines are also
expected to change over time as well, as the level of security and due diligence for mitigating
risks within organizations increases. A dynamic, flexible, and technically rigorous set of security
controls will be maintained in the control catalog to allow organizations and communities of
interest to continue to be able to select the appropriate controls for their respective needs in a
cost-effective manner.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS




T
       his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for an
       information system including: (i) the organization’s overall approach to managing risk; (ii)
       the security categorization of the system in accordance with FIPS 199 and the selection of
minimum (baseline) security controls; (iii) the activities associated with tailoring the baseline
security controls through the application of scoping guidance19 and the assignment of
organization-defined parameters; and (iv) the potential for supplementing the minimum security
controls with additional controls, as necessary, to achieve adequate security.

3.1 MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL RISK
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of
organizational risk—that is, the risk associated with the operation of an information system. The
management of organizational risk is a key element in the organization’s information security
program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate security controls for
an information system—the security controls necessary to protect the operations and assets of the
organization. Managing organizational risk includes several important activities: (i) assessing
risk; (ii) conducting cost-benefit analyses; (iii) selecting, implementing, and assessing security
controls; and (iv) formally authorizing the information system for operation (also known as
security accreditation). The risk-based approach to security control selection and specification
considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, executive
orders, policies, standards, or regulations. The following activities related to managing
organizational risk are paramount to an effective information security program and can be applied
to both new and legacy information systems within the context of the System Development Life
Cycle and the Federal Enterprise Architecture—
•    Categorize the information system and the information resident within that system based on a
     FIPS 199 impact analysis.
•    Select an initial set of security controls (i.e., baseline) for the information system as a starting
     point based on the FIPS 199 security categorization.
•    Adjust (or tailor) the initial set of security controls based on an assessment of risk and local
     conditions including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information,
     cost-benefit analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.20
•    Document the agreed-upon set of security controls in the system security plan including the
     organization’s justification for any refinements or adjustments to the initial set of controls.21

19
  Scoping guidance provides organizations with specific considerations on the applicability and implementation of
individual security controls in the control baselines (see Section 3.3).
20
  NIST Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance
on the assessment of risk.
21
  NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems,
provides guidance on documenting information system security controls.

Special Publication 800-53                            Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Implement the security controls in the information system. For legacy systems, some or all of
     the security controls selected may already be in place.
•    Assess the security controls using appropriate methods and procedures to determine the
     extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
     the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.22
•    Determine the risk to organizational operations and assets resulting from the planned or
     continued operation of the information system.
•    Authorize information system processing (or for legacy systems, authorize continued system
     processing) if the level of risk to the organization’s operations or assets is acceptable.23
•    Monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on a continuous basis
     including documenting changes to the system, conducting security impact analyses of the
     associated changes, and reporting the security status of the system to appropriate
     organizational officials on a regular basis.

The remainder of this chapter focuses on the first three activities in managing organizational
risk—the FIPS 199 security categorization, the initial selection of security controls based on the
security categorization, and the tailoring of the initial controls based on the organization’s risk
assessment.

3.2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION AND BASELINE SELECTION
FIPS 199, the mandatory federal security categorization standard, is predicated on a simple and
well-established concept—determining appropriate priorities for organizational information
systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to adequately protect those systems.
The security controls applied to a particular information system should be commensurate with the
potential impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals should there
be a breach in security due to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS 199
requires organizations to categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or
high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The potential
impact values assigned to the respective security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water
mark) from among the security categories that have been determined for each type of information
resident on those information systems.24 The generalized format for expressing the security
category (SC) of an information system is:

         SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
                   where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept is used to determine
the impact level of the information system for the express purpose of selecting an initial set of

public draft projected for publication in the spring 2005), provides guidance for determining the effectiveness of
security controls.
23
  NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
Systems, provides guidance on the security authorization of information systems.
24
   NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.



                                                      PAGE 13

________________________________________________________________________________________________


security controls from one of the three security control baselines.25 Thus, a low-impact system is
defined as an information system in which all three of the security objectives are low. A
moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least one of the security objectives
is moderate and no security objective is greater than moderate. And finally, a high-impact system
is an information system in which at least one security objective is high. Once the overall impact
level of the information system is determined, an initial set of security controls can be selected
from the corresponding low, moderate, or high baselines listed in Appendix D.

3.3 TAILORING THE INITIAL BASELINE
After the appropriate security control baseline is selected, three additional steps are needed to
tailor the baseline for a specific organizational information system: (i) the application of scoping
guidance to the initial baseline; (ii) the specification of organization-defined parameters in the
security controls, where appropriate; and (iii) the specification of compensating security controls,
if needed. To ensure a cost-effective, risk-based approach to achieving adequate information
security organization-wide, tailoring activities should be coordinated with appropriate officials
(e.g., senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials). The resulting set of
security controls is documented in the security plan for the information system.

Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides organizations with specific considerations on the applicability and
implementation of individual security controls in the control baselines. There are several
considerations that can potentially impact how the baseline controls are applied: (i) technology-
related considerations; (ii) infrastructure-related considerations; (iii) public access-related
considerations; (iv) scalability-related considerations; (v) common security control-related
considerations; and (vi) risk-related considerations.
Technology-related considerations—
•    Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
     infrastructure) are only applicable if those technologies are employed or are required to be
     employed within the information system.
•    Security controls are only applicable to the components of the information system that
     typically provide or support the security capability addressed by the control.26 For
     information system components that are single-user, not networked, or only locally
     networked, one or more of these characteristics may provide appropriate rationale for not
     applying selected controls to that component.

25
   The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, the security controls in the control catalog are not categorized by
security objective—rather, they are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of
information systems based on impact level. The application of scoping guidance may allow selective security control
baseline adjustments or tailoring (see Section 3.3).
26
  For example, auditing controls would typically be applied to the components of an information system that provide
or should provide auditing capability (servers, etc.) and would not necessarily be applied to every user-level
workstation within the organization. Access control mechanisms would not typically be applied to such devices as
personal digital assistants, facsimile machines, printers, pagers, cellular telephones, or other components of an
information system that provide limited functionality. Organizations should, however, carefully assess the inventory of
components that comprise their information systems to determine which security controls are applicable to the various
components. As technology advances, increased functionality may be present in such devices as personal digital
assistants and cellular telephones, which may require the application of security controls in accordance with an
organizational assessment of risk.



                                                        PAGE 14
Special Publication 800-53                    Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•   Security controls and control enhancements that can be either explicitly or implicitly
    supported by automated mechanisms, do not require the development of such mechanisms if
    the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government
    off-the-shelf products. In situations where automated mechanisms are not readily available,
    cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through
    non-automated mechanisms or procedures may be used to satisfy specified security controls
    or control enhancements (see discussion on compensating security controls below).

Infrastructure-related considerations—
•   Security controls that refer to organizational facilities (e.g., physical controls such as locks
    and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting, fire, and power) are
    applicable only to those sections of the facilities that directly provide protection to, support,
    or are related to the information system (including its information technology assets such as
    electronic mail or web servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, controlled
    interface equipment, and communications equipment) under consideration.

Public access-related considerations—
•   Security controls associated with public access information systems should be carefully
    considered and applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control
    baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be
    applicable to users accessing information systems through public interfaces. For example,
    while the baseline controls sets require identification and authentication of agency personnel
    that maintain and support information systems that provide the public access services, the
    same controls might not be required for users accessing those information systems through
    public interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other hand, identification
    and authentication would be required for users accessing information systems through public
    interfaces to access/change their private/personal information.

Scalability-related considerations—
•   Security controls are scalable either by the size of the particular organization implementing
    the controls or the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system being
    protected, or both. The following examples take both scalability factors into consideration. A
    contingency plan for a large organization with a FIPS 199 moderate-impact or high-impact
    information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of implementation
    detail. In contrast, a contingency plan for a smaller organization with a FIPS 199 low-impact
    information system may be considerably shorter and contain much less implementation
    detail. Organizations should use discretion in scaling the security controls to the particular
    environment of use to ensure a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control
    implementation.

Common security control-related considerations—
•   Security controls designated by the organization as common controls are managed by an
    organizational entity other than the information system owner. Organizational decisions on
    which security controls are viewed as common controls may greatly affect the responsibilities
    of individual information system owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a
    particular baseline. Decisions on common control designations will not, however, affect the
    organization’s responsibility in providing the security controls included in the baseline.
    Every control in a baseline must be addressed either by the organization or the information
    system owner.

Special Publication 800-53                             Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Risk-related considerations—
•    Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security
     objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
     appropriately modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) if, and only if the
     downgrading action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS 199 security categorization for the
     corresponding security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, or availability before moving
     to the high water mark;27 (ii) is supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii)
     does not affect the security-relevant information within the information system.28 The
     following security controls are potential candidates for downgrading: (i) for confidentiality
     [AC-15, MA-3 (3), MP-3, MP-6, PE-5, SC-4, SC-9]; (ii) for integrity [SC-8]; and (iii) for
     availability [CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-13, PE-15, SC-6].29

Organization-Defined Security Control Parameters
Security controls containing organization-defined parameters (i.e., assignment and/or selection
operations) give organizations the flexibility to define selected portions of the controls to support
specific organizational requirements or objectives. After the application of the scoping guidance,
organizations should review the list of security controls for assignment and selection operations
and provide appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Where
specified, minimum and maximum values for organization-defined parameters should be adhered
to unless more restrictive values are prescribed by applicable laws, directives, executive orders,
policies, standards, or regulations or are indicated by the risk assessment in order to adequately
mitigate risk.

Compensating Security Controls
With the diverse nature of today’s information systems, organizations may find it necessary, on
occasion, to specify and employ compensating security controls. A compensating security
control is a management, operational, or technical control (i.e., safeguard or countermeasure)
employed by an organization in lieu of a recommended control in the low, moderate, or high
baselines described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, which provides equivalent or
comparable protection for an information system.30 A compensating control for an information
system may be employed by an organization only under the following conditions: (i) the

27
   When applying the “high water mark” process in Section 3.2, some of the original FIPS 199 confidentiality, integrity,
or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher baseline of security controls. As part of this
process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
28
   Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables, cryptographic
key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within an information system. Certain
security controls within an information system are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and
integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality
or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the downgrading action does not affect the security-relevant
information within the information system.
29
   Certain security controls that are uniquely attributable to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would
ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading (e.g., AC-16, AU-10, CP-5, IA-7, MP-7, PE-12, PE-14, PL-
5, SC-5, SC-13, SC-14, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls are either selected for use in all
baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded or the controls are optional and not selected for use in
any baseline.
30
  For example, an organization with significant staff limitations may have difficulty in meeting the separation of duty
security control but may employ compensating controls by strengthening the audit and accountability controls and
personnel security controls within the information system.

organization selects the compensating control from the security control catalog in NIST Special
Publication 800-53; (ii) the organization provides a complete and convincing rationale and
justification for how the compensating control provides an equivalent security capability or level
of protection for the information system; and (iii) the organization assesses and formally accepts
the risk associated with employing the compensating control in the information system. The use
of compensating security controls should be reviewed, documented in the system security plan,
and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

3.4 SUPPLEMENTING THE INITIAL BASELINE
The security control baselines listed in Appendix D should be viewed as foundations or starting
points in the selection of adequate security controls for information systems. The baselines
represent, for classes of information systems (derived from FIPS 199 security categorizations),
the minimum level of due diligence demonstrated by an organization toward the protection of its
operations and assets. As described in Section 3.1, the final determination of the appropriate set
of security controls necessary to provide adequate security is a function of the organization’s
assessment of risk. In many cases, additional or enhanced security controls will be needed to
address specific threats to and vulnerabilities in the information system or to satisfy the
requirements of applicable laws, directives, executive orders, policies, standards, or regulations.
Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of the security control catalog to facilitate
the process of enhancing security controls or adding controls to the current baselines. The
techniques and methodologies used by organizations in supplementing the security control
baselines are beyond the scope of this special publication.

                              information by the executive agency. For purposes of the
                              preceding sentence, equipment is used by an executive agency if
                              the equipment is used by the executive agency directly or is used
                              by a contractor under a contract with the executive agency which:
                              (i) requires the use of such equipment; or (ii) requires the use, to a
                              significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a
                              service or the furnishing of a product. The term information
                              technology includes computers, ancillary equipment, software,
                              firmware, and similar procedures, services (including support
                              services), and related resources.
 Information Type             A specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical,
 [FIPS 199]                   proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security
                              management) defined by an organization or in some instances, by
                              a specific law, executive order, directive, policy, or regulation.
 Integrity                    Guarding against improper information modification or
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]       destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation
                              and authenticity.
 Label                        See Security Label.
 Low-Impact System            An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e.,
                              confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS
                              199 potential impact value of low.
 Major Application            An application that requires special attention to security due to
 [OMB Circular A-130,         the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
 Appendix III]                unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the
                              application. Note: All federal applications require some level of
                              protection. Certain applications, because of the information in
                              them, however, require special management oversight and should
                              be treated as major. Adequate security for other applications
                              should be provided by security of the systems in which they
                              operate.
 Major Information System     An information system that requires special management
 [OMB Circular A-130]         attention because of its importance to an agency mission; its high

        he following table lists the minimum security controls, or security control baselines, for
        low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems. If a security control
        is selected for one of the baselines, the family identifier and control number are listed in
the appropriate column. If a control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked “not
selected.” Control enhancements, when used to supplement basic security controls, are indicated
by the number of the control enhancement. For example, an “IR-2 (1) (2)” in the high baseline entry
for the IR-2 security control indicates that the second control from the Incident Response family
has been selected along with control enhancements (1) and (2). Some security controls and control
enhancements in the security control catalog are not used in any of the baselines but are available
for optional use by organizations when indicated based on the results of a risk assessment. A
complete description of security controls, supplemental guidance for the controls, and control
enhancements is provided in Appendix F. A detailed listing of security controls and control
enhancements for each control baseline is available at: http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.

T
       he minimum assurance requirements for security controls described in the security control
       catalog are listed below. The assurance requirements are directed at the activities and
       actions that security control developers and implementers31 define and apply to increase
the level of confidence that the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
information system. The assurance requirements are applied on a control-by-control basis. The
requirements are grouped by security control baseline (i.e., low, moderate, and high) since the
requirements apply to each control within the respective baseline. Using a format similar to
security controls, assurance requirements are followed by supplemental guidance that provides
additional detail and explanation of how the requirements are to be applied. Bolded text indicates
requirements that appear for the first time in a particular baseline.

Low Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the low baseline, the focus is on the control being in place
with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are discovered, they are addressed in a
timely manner.

Moderate Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the control.
The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned
responsibilities and specific actions to ensure that when the control is implemented, it will meet its
required function or purpose. These actions include, for example, requiring the development of
records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the moderate baseline, the focus is on ensuring correct
implementation and operation of the control. While flaws are still likely to be uncovered (and addressed
expeditiously), the control developer/implementer incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities
and produces specific documentation to ensure the control meets its required function or purpose.

High Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis
and testing of the control (including functional interfaces among control components). The control
developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned responsibilities and specific
actions to ensure that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently (i.e., across

  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls for an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and software
vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as information
system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other individuals with
security responsibility for the information system.

the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the
effectiveness of the control. These actions include, for example, requiring the development of records
with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the high baseline, the focus is expanded to require, within
the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the control and
continuous improvement in the control’s effectiveness. The developer/implementer is expected to expend
significant effort on the design, development, implementation, and component/integration testing of the
controls and to produce associated design and implementation documentation to support these activities.
For security controls in the high baseline, this same documentation is needed by assessors to analyze and
test the internal components of the control as part of the overall assessment of the control.

Additional Requirements Enhancing the Moderate and High Baselines

Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
testing of the control. The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, actions
to ensure that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently (i.e., across the
information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the effectiveness of
the control. These actions include requiring the development of records with structure and content suitable
to facilitate making this determination. The control is developed in a manner that supports a high
degree of confidence that the control is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: The additional high assurance requirements are intended to supplement the
minimum assurance requirements for the moderate and high baselines, when appropriate, in order to protect
against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of
protection is required for those information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the risks
associated with the type of threat agents cited above.

APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE, AND CONTROL ENHANCEMENTS




T
       he following catalog of security controls provides a range of safeguards and
       countermeasures for information systems. The security controls are organized into
       families for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. Each family
contains security controls related to the security function of the family. A standardized, two-
character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. To uniquely identify
each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to indicate the number of
the control with the control family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. The control section
provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to protect a particular
aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific security-related
activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information system. For some
controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to
selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations within the main body of the
control.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations should consider supplemental guidance when defining, developing, and
implementing security controls. Applicable federal legislation, executive orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST
Special Publications) are listed in the supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the
particular security control.

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a
basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control.

With regard to cryptography employed in federal information systems, organizations must
comply with current federal policy and meet the requirements of FIPS 140-2, Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. The FIPS 140-2 standard also acknowledges the use of
cryptography approved by the National Security Agency as an appropriate alternative for
organizations. Consult FIPS 140-2 for specific guidance.

AC-1     ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
         documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and
         compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access
         control policy and associated access controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: The access control policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
         federal laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The access control policy
         can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Access
         control procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular
         information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on
         security policies and procedures.
         Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW AC-1                    MOD AC-1                    HIGH AC-1



AC-2     ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including establishing, activating,
         modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. The organization reviews information
         system accounts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: Account management includes the identification of account types (i.e.,
         individual, group, and system), establishment of conditions for group membership, and assignment
         of associated authorizations. The organization identifies authorized users of the information
         system and specifies access rights/privileges. The organization grants access to the information
         system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know that is determined by assigned official duties and
         satisfying all personnel security criteria; and (ii) intended system usage. The organization requires
         proper identification for requests to establish information system accounts and approves all such
         requests. The organization specifically authorizes and monitors the use of guest/anonymous
         accounts and removes, disables, or otherwise secures unnecessary accounts. The organization
         ensures that account managers are notified when information system users are terminated or
         transferred and associated accounts are removed, disabled, or otherwise secured. Account
         managers are also notified when users’ information system usage or need-to-know changes.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
               system accounts.
         (2)   The information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts after
               [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
         (3)   The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organization-
               defined time period].
         (4)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to ensure that account creation, modification,
               disabling, and termination actions are audited and, as required, appropriate individuals are
               notified.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

AC-3     ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

         Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to the
         system in accordance with applicable policy.
         Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
         ruled-based policies) and associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists,
         access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between
         users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes,
         programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to controlling access at the information
         system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
         necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. If encryption of stored
         information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS
         140-2 compliant.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The information system ensures that access to security functions (deployed in hardware, software,
               and firmware) and information is restricted to authorized personnel (e.g., security administrators).


           LOW AC-3                     MOD AC-3 (1)                 HIGH AC-3 (1)



AC-4     INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

         Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow of
         information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable
         policy.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are
         employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and
         destinations (e.g., individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected
         systems based on the characteristics of the information. Simple examples of flow control
         enforcement can be found in firewall and router devices that employ rule sets or establish
         configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet filtering
         capability. Flow control enforcement can also be found in information systems that use explicit
         labels on information, source, and destination objects as the basis for flow control decisions (e.g.,
         to control the release of certain types of information).
         Control Enhancements: None.

AC-5     SEPARATION OF DUTIES

         Control: The information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access
         authorizations.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility and
         separates duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and duties of
         individuals. There is access control software on the information system that prevents users from
         having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform fraudulent activity without
         collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information
         system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals
         perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming,
         quality assurance/testing, configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security
         personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.

         Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected            MOD AC-5                    HIGH AC-5



AC-6     LEAST PRIVILEGE

         Control: The information system enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses
         needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs the concept of least privilege for specific duties
         and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk
         assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational
         assets, and individuals.
         Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected            MOD AC-6                    HIGH AC-6



AC-7     UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

         Control: The information system enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number]
         consecutive invalid access attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time
         period] time period. The information system automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for
         an [Assignment: organization-defined time period], delays next login prompt according to
         [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm.]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
         attempts is exceeded.
         Supplemental Guidance: Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
         the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
         period established by the organization.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The information system automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator
               when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

AC-8     SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

         Control: The information system displays an approved, system use notification message before
         granting system access informing potential users: (i) that the user is accessing a U.S. Government
         information system; (ii) that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; (iii)
         that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
         (iv) that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording. The system use
         notification message provides appropriate privacy and security notices (based on associated
         privacy and security policies or summaries) and remains on the screen until the user takes explicit
         actions to log on to the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Privacy and security policies are consistent with applicable federal laws,
         directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. For publicly accessible systems: (i) the
         system use information is available as opposed to displaying the information before granting
         access; (ii) there are no references to monitoring, recording, or auditing since privacy
         accommodations for such systems generally prohibit those activities; and (iii) the notice given to
         public users of the information system includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
         Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW AC-8                    MOD AC-8                  HIGH AC-8



AC-9     PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION

         Control: The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon, of the date and time of
         the last logon, and the number of unsuccessful logon attempts since the last successful logon.
         Supplemental Guidance: None.

         Control Enhancements: None.

AC-11    SESSION LOCK

         Control: The information system prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock
         that remains in effect until the user reestablishes access using appropriate identification and
         authentication procedures.
         Supplemental Guidance: Users can directly initiate session lock mechanisms. The information
         system also activates session lock mechanisms automatically after a specified period of inactivity
         defined by the organization. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the information
         system.
         Control Enhancements: None.

AC-13    SUPERVISION AND REVIEW — ACCESS CONTROL

         Control: The organization supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect to the
         enforcement and usage of information system access controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews audit records (e.g., user activity logs) for
         inappropriate activities in accordance with organizational procedures. The organization
         investigates any unusual information system-related activities and periodically reviews changes to
         access authorizations. The organization reviews more frequently, the activities of users with
         significant information system roles and responsibilities.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the review of user activities.

AC-14    PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION

         Control: The organization identifies specific user actions that can be performed on the information
         system without identification or authentication.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization allows limited user activity without identification and
         authentication for public websites or other publicly available information systems.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization permits actions to be performed without identification and authentication only to
               the extent necessary to accomplish mission objectives.

AC-17    REMOTE ACCESS

         Control: The organization documents, monitors, and controls all methods of remote access (e.g.,
         dial-up, Internet) to the information system including remote access for privileged functions.
         Appropriate organization officials authorize each remote access method for the information
         system and authorize only the necessary users for each access method.
         Supplemental Guidance: Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than
         public web servers or systems specifically designed for public access. The organization restricts
         access achieved through dial-up connections (e.g., limiting dial-up access based upon source of
         request) or protects against unauthorized connections or subversion of authorized connections
         (e.g., using virtual private network technology). The organization permits remote access for
         privileged functions only for compelling operational needs. NIST Special Publication 800-63
         provides guidance on remote electronic authentication.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of
               remote access methods.
         (2)   The organization uses encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.
         (3)   The organization controls all remote accesses through a managed access control point.

AC-18    WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS

         Control: The organization: (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for
         wireless technologies; and (ii) documents, monitors, and controls wireless access to the
         information system. Appropriate organizational officials authorize the use of wireless
         technologies.
         Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-48 provides guidance on wireless network
         security with particular emphasis on the IEEE 802.11b and Bluetooth standards.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization uses authentication and encryption to protect wireless access to the information

         electronic authentication. For other than remote situations, when users identify and authenticate to
         information systems within a specified security perimeter which is considered to offer sufficient
         protection, NIST Special Publication 800-63 guidance should be applied as follows: (i) for low-
         impact information systems, tokens that meet Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 requirements are acceptable; (ii)
         for moderate-impact information systems, tokens that meet Level 2, 3, or 4 requirements are
         acceptable; and (iii) for high-impact information systems, tokens that meet Level 3 or 4
         requirements are acceptable. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information
         system level, identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level,
         when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
         Control Enhancements:

IA-3     DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

         Control: The information system identifies and authenticates specific devices before establishing a
         connection.
         Supplemental Guidance: The information system typically uses either shared known information
         (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control Program/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
         addresses) or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible
         Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS)
         authentication) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks.

IA-4     IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying each user; (ii)
         verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user identifier from an
         appropriate organization official; (iv) ensuring that the user identifier is issued to the intended
         party; (v) disabling user identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of
         inactivity; and (vi) archiving user identifiers.
         Supplemental Guidance: Identifier management is not applicable to shared information system
         accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73 and
         800-76 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) card token for use in the unique identification
         and authentication of federal employees and contractors.

IA-5     AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages information system authenticators (e.g., tokens, PKI
         certificates, biometrics, passwords, key cards) by: (i) defining initial authenticator content; (ii)
         establishing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised,
         or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators; and (iii) changing default
         authenticators upon information system installation.
         Supplemental Guidance: Users take reasonable measures to safeguard authenticators including
         maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators
         with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. For password-based
         authentication, the information system: (i) protects passwords from unauthorized disclosure and
         modification when stored and transmitted; (ii) prohibits passwords from being displayed when
         entered; (iii) enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions; and (iv) prohibits
         password reuse for a specified number of generations. For PKI-based authentication, the
         information system: (i) validates certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted
         trust anchor; (ii) establishes user control of the corresponding private key; and (iii) maps the
         authenticated identity to the user account. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73 and 800-76
         specify a personal identity verification (PIV) card token for use in the unique identification and
         authentication of federal employees and contractors. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides
         guidance on remote electronic authentication.

IA-6     AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK
         Control: The information system provides feedback to a user during an attempted authentication
         and that feedback does not compromise the authentication mechanism.
         Supplemental Guidance: The information system may obscure feedback of authentication
         information during the authentication process (e.g., displaying asterisks when a user types in a
         password).
         Control Enhancements: None.

MA-4     REMOTE MAINTENANCE

         Control: The organization approves, controls, and monitors remotely executed maintenance and
         diagnostic activities.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization describes the use of remote diagnostic tools in the
         security plan for the information system. The organization maintains maintenance logs for all
         remote maintenance, diagnostic, and service activities. Appropriate organization officials
         periodically review maintenance logs. Other techniques to consider for improving the security of
         remote maintenance include: (i) encryption and decryption of diagnostic communications; (ii)
         strong identification and authentication techniques, such as Level 3 or 4 tokens as described in
         NIST Special Publication 800-63; and (iii) remote disconnect verification. When remote
         maintenance is completed, the organization (or information system in certain cases) terminates all
         sessions and remote connections. If password-based authentication is used during remote
         maintenance, the organization changes the passwords following each remote maintenance service.
         For high-impact information systems, if remote diagnostic or maintenance services are required
         from a service or organization that does not implement for its own information system the same
         level of security as that implemented on the system being serviced, the system being serviced is
         sanitized and physically separated from other information systems before the connection of the
         remote access line. If the information system cannot be sanitized (e.g., due to a system failure),
         remote maintenance is not allowed.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization audits all remote maintenance sessions, and appropriate organizational
               personnel review the audit logs of the remote sessions.
         (2)   The organization addresses the installation and use of remote diagnostic links in the security plan
               for the information system.
         (3)   Remote diagnostic or maintenance services are acceptable if performed by a service or
               organization that implements for its own information system the same level of security as that
               implemented on the information system being serviced.

SC-2     APPLICATION PARTITIONING

         Control: The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)
         from information system management functionality.
         Supplemental Guidance:  The information system physically or logically separates user interface
         services (e.g., public web pages) from information storage and management services (e.g.,
         database management). Separation may be accomplished through the use of different computers,
         different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network
         addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate.

SC-3     SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION

         Control:   The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.
         Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
         functions by means of partitions, domains, etc., including control of access to and integrity of, the
         hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. The information system
         maintains a separate execution domain (e.g., address space) for each executing process.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The information system employs underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate security
               function isolation.
         (2)   The information system further divides the security functions with the functions enforcing access
               and information flow control isolated and protected from both nonsecurity functions and from
               other security functions.
         (3)   The information system minimizes the amount of nonsecurity functions included within the
               isolation boundary containing security functions.
         (4)   The information system security maintains its security functions in largely independent modules
               that avoid unnecessary interactions between modules.
         (5)   The information system security maintains its security functions in a layered structure minimizing
               interactions between layers of the design.

         shared system resources.
         Supplemental Guidance:   Control of information system remnants, sometimes referred to as object
         reuse, prevents information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the
         actions of a prior user/role (or the actions of a process acting on behalf of a prior user/role) from
         being available to any current user/role (or current process) that obtains access to a shared system
         resource (e.g., registers, main memory, secondary storage) after that resource has been released
         back to the information system.
         Control Enhancements: None.

SC-5     DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

         Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
         denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of denial of service
         attacks or reference to source for current list].
         Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
         effects of denial of service attacks. For example, network perimeter devices can filter certain
         types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network from being directly
         affected by denial of service attacks. Information systems that are publicly accessible can be
         protected by employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The information system restricts the ability of users to launch denial of service attacks against
               other information systems or networks.
         (2)   The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
               effects of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.

SC-7     BOUNDARY PROTECTION

         Control: The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary
         of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
         Supplemental Guidance:   Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or information
         systems, occur through controlled interfaces (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, encrypted
         tunnels). The operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms does not result in any
         unauthorized release of information outside of the information system boundary. Information
         system boundary protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels
         of protection as that of the primary site.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization physically allocates publicly accessible information system components (e.g.,
               public web servers) to separate subnetworks with separate, physical network interfaces. The
               organization prevents public access into the organization’s internal networks except as
               appropriately mediated.

SI-7     SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

         Control: The information system detects and protects against unauthorized changes to software and
         information.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs integrity verification applications on the
         information system to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. The
         organization employs good software engineering practices with regard to commercial off-the-shelf
         integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and
         uses tools to automatically monitor the integrity of the information system and the applications it
         hosts.

SI-8     SPAM AND SPYWARE PROTECTION

         Control: The information system implements spam and spyware protection.

         Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs spam and spyware protection mechanisms at
         critical information system entry points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, remote-access
         servers) and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network. The
         organization uses the spam and spyware protection mechanisms to detect and take appropriate
         action on unsolicited messages and spyware/adware, respectively, transported by electronic mail,
         electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, removable media (e.g., diskettes or compact disks),
         or other common means. Consideration is given to using spam and spyware protection software
         products from multiple vendors (e.g., using one vendor for boundary devices and servers and
         another vendor for workstations).
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)   The organization centrally manages spam and spyware protection mechanisms.
         (2)   The information system automatically updates spam and spyware protection mechanisms.

SI-9     INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS

         Control: The organization restricts the information input to the information system to authorized
         personnel only.
         Supplemental Guidance: Restrictions on personnel authorized to input information to the
         information system may extend beyond the typical access controls employed by the system and
         include limitations based on specific operational/project responsibilities.

SI-10    INFORMATION INPUT ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, AND VALIDITY

         Control: The information system checks information inputs for accuracy, completeness, and
         validity.
         Supplemental Guidance: Checks for accuracy, completeness, and validity of information should be
         accomplished as close to the point of origin as possible. Rules for checking the valid syntax of
         information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in
         place to ensure that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to
         interpreters should be prescreened to ensure the content is not unintentionally interpreted as
         commands. The extent to which the information system is able to check the accuracy,
         completeness, and validity of information inputs should be guided by organizational policy and
         operational requirements.
         Control Enhancements: None.

SI-11    ERROR HANDLING

         Control: The information system identifies and handles error conditions in an expeditious manner.

         Supplemental Guidance: The structure and content of error messages should be carefully considered
         by the organization. User error messages generated by the information system should provide
         timely and useful information to users without revealing information that could be exploited by
         adversaries. System error messages should be revealed only to authorized personnel (e.g., systems
         administrators, maintenance personnel). Sensitive information (e.g., account numbers, social
         security numbers, and credit card numbers) should not be listed in error logs or associated
         administrative messages. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and
         handle error conditions should be guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
         Control Enhancements: None.

APPENDIX G

SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS
RELATIONSHIP OF SECURITY CONTROLS TO OTHER STANDARDS AND CONTROL SETS




T
       he mapping table in this appendix provides organizations with a general indication of
       Special Publication 800-53 security control coverage with respect to other frequently
       referenced security control standards and control sets.32 The security control mappings are
not exhaustive and are based on a broad interpretation and general understanding of the control
sets being compared. The mappings are created by using the primary security topic identified in
each of the Special Publication 800-53 security controls and associated control enhancements (if
any) and searching for a similar security topic in the other referenced security control standards
and control sets. Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the mapping
table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 17799
business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not exactly the same, functionality. In some
instances, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different context,
perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information flow
broadly in terms of assigned authorizations for controlling access between source and destination
objects, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 addresses the information flow more narrowly as it applies to
interconnected network domains. And finally, the following cautionary notes are in order:
•    The granularity of the security controls sets being compared is not always the same. This
     difference in granularity makes the security control mappings less precise in some instances.
     Therefore, the mappings should not be used as a “checklist” for the express purpose of
     comparing security capabilities or security implementations across information systems
     assessed against different control sets.
•    Some of the control sets referenced in this appendix (e.g., Department of Defense Instruction
     8500.2) are organized into groups of security controls with each group reflecting different
     levels of protection. When the security control groups reflect a hierarchical enhancement of
     another group, only the paragraph reference from the lowest hierarchical group where the
     security topic first occurred is listed in the mapping column.

Organizations are encouraged to use the mapping table only as a starting point for conducting
further analyses and interpretation of control similarity and associated coverage when comparing
disparate control sets.

  The security control mapping table includes references to: (i) ISO/IEC FDIS 17799:2004Nov28, Code of Practice for
Information Security Management; (ii) NIST Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for
Information Technology Systems; (iii) GAO, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual; (iv) Director of
Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 Policy and Manual, Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information within
Information Systems; and (v) Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation. The
designations in the respective columns indicate the paragraph identifier(s) or number(s) in the above documents where
the security controls, control objectives, or associated implementation guidance may be found.

   References in this column are to both DCI Directive 6/3 and to its Manual (Administrative update, December 2003).
Paragraphs cited from the Directive are preceded by “DCID” and where there are also references for the same control
from the Manual, these are preceded by “Manual.” Where only paragraph numbers appear, they are references to the
Manual. References to paragraphs in the Manual should be construed to encompass all subparagraphs related to those
paragraphs. It should also be noted that Special Publication 800-53 contains a set of security controls that cover
personnel, physical, and technical security measures, and therefore, the scope of the publication is broader than DCID
6/3. Some of the controls in Special Publication 800-53 are explicitly not included in DCID 6/3 because they are
addressed in other DCID and Intelligence Community (IC) policy documents. The difference in scope/breadth between
Special Publication 800-53 and DCID 6/3 impacts the degree of correlation between the two documents. Thus, the lack
of a “mapping” for a particular Special Publication 800-53 control to a DCID 6/3 requirement does not mean that there
is no similar IC requirement. The IC Translation Review Board provided information for the DCID 6/3 mapping.
