105   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
106   with industry, government, and academic organizations.

107                                              Abstract

108   The macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP) provides resources that system administrators,
109   security professionals, security policy authors, information security officers, and auditors can
110   leverage to secure and assess macOS desktop and laptop system security in an automated way.
111   This publication introduces the mSCP and gives an overview of the resources available from the
112   project’s GitHub site, which is continuously curated and updated to support each new release of
113   macOS. The GitHub site provides practical, actionable recommendations in the form of secure
114   baselines and associated rules. This publication also describes use cases for leveraging the mSCP
115   content.

133                                        Call for Patent Claims

134   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
135   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
136   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
137   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
138   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
139   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

140   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
141   in written or electronic form, either:

142          •   assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
143              hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or

144          •   assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
145              applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
146              guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:

147                  o under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any
148                    unfair discrimination; or
149                  o without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
150                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

151   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
152   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
153   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
154   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
155   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

156   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
157   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

158   Such statements should be addressed to applesec@nist.gov, with the subject: “SP 800-219 Call
159   for Patent Claims.”

                                                                              GUIDANCE FROM THE MSCP

161   Executive Summary

162   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has traditionally published secure
163   configuration guides for Apple desktop/laptop operating system versions as prose-based Special
164   Publications (SPs), such as NIST SP 800-179 Revision 1, Guide to Securing Apple macOS 10.12
165   Systems for IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration Checklist. In order to provide
166   security configuration guidance to organizations more quickly and in a machine-consumable
167   format, NIST has established the open-source macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP).
168   Instead of NIST producing a prose SP guidance document for each macOS release, the mSCP
169   will continuously curate and update machine-consumable macOS guidance.

170   The mSCP seeks to simplify the macOS security development cycle by reducing the amount of
171   effort required to implement security baselines. Security baselines are groups of settings used to
172   configure a system to meet a target level or set of requirements, or to verify that a system
173   complies with requirements. The mSCP, a collaboration among federal agencies, minimizes
174   duplicate effort that would otherwise be needed for these agencies to administer individual
175   security baselines. Additionally, the secure baseline content provided is easily extensible by
176   other parties to implement their own security requirements.

177   This document provides a high-level overview of the mSCP, its components, and some common
178   use cases. Readers seeking more detailed information on mSCP content or the content itself
179   should visit the mSCP GitHub page (https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security) and wiki
180   (https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki).

181   Organizations using mSCP content, particularly security baseline examples, should take a risk-
182   based approach for selecting the appropriate settings and defining setting values that takes into
183   account the context under which the baseline will be utilized.

212   1     Introduction

213   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has traditionally published secure
214   configuration guides for Apple desktop/laptop operating system versions as prose-based Special
215   Publications (SPs), such as NIST SP 800-179 Revision 1, Guide to Securing Apple macOS 10.12
216   Systems for IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration Checklist. NIST will no longer
217   produce SP guidance documents for each macOS release, but instead will continuously curate
218   and update machine-consumable guidance as part of NIST’s macOS Security Compliance
219   Project (mSCP) to keep up with each macOS release version.

220   The latest macOS security baseline content is maintained and updated on the mSCP GitHub
221   page, https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security [1]. Security baselines are groups of settings
222   used to configure a system to meet a target level or set of requirements, or to verify that a system
223   complies with requirements. The mSCP seeks to simplify the macOS security development cycle
224   by reducing the amount of effort required to implement security baselines. This collaboration
225   between federal agencies minimizes duplicate effort that would otherwise be needed for these
226   agencies to administer individual security baselines. Additionally, the secure baseline content
227   provided is easily extensible by other parties to implement their own security requirements.

228   1.1   Purpose and Scope

229   The purpose of this document is to introduce the mSCP to broader audiences. This document
230   provides a high-level overview of the mSCP, its components, and some common use cases. It
231   refers readers to the online project documentation for in-depth technical information and use
232   instructions. This document is intended to be independent of macOS version releases; updates
233   will be released as needed when there are substantial changes to the mSCP.

234   The information in this document regarding the details of the mSCP GitHub site is accurate at
235   the time of publication. Check the project wiki
236   (https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki) for the latest information.

237   The release of SP 800-219 formally deprecates NIST SP 800-179 [2] and SP 800-179 Revision 1
238   [3]; their applicable recommendations have already been added to corresponding mSCP
239   baselines. Organizations needing to reference a NIST SP to demonstrate how they are complying
240   with United States Government mandates for adopting secure configurations for their macOS
241   devices may reference this SP instead of SP 800-179 or SP 800-179 Revision 1.

242   1.2   Audience

243   This document—and the mSCP GitHub site—are intended for system administrators, security
244   professionals, policy authors, privacy officers, and auditors who have responsibilities involving
245   macOS security. Additionally, vendors of device management, security, configuration
246   assessment, and compliance tools supporting macOS may find this document and the GitHub site
247   to be helpful.

261   2         Project Description

262   The mSCP is an open-source project providing a programmatic approach to generating and using
263   macOS security configuration baselines. The project’s content can be used to create customized
264   security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of rules, with each rule
265   mapped to requirements in one or more existing security standards, regulations, frameworks, etc.
266   This approach provides versioning and consistency of the content. Unifying and standardizing
267   macOS baseline efforts via the mSCP means that updating security guidance is simplified and
268   radically accelerated, even as new versions of macOS are introduced annually.

269   The mSCP started in August 2019 as a collaboration among operational IT security staff from
270   NIST, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Information
271   Systems Agency (DISA), and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Los Alamos National
272   Laboratory (LANL). 1 The mSCP sought to map macOS settings to the NIST SP 800-53 Revision
273   4 [4] document with an extensible, modern approach to security guidance that could be used by
274   any organization (e.g., government, enterprise, education) that needs to adhere to security
275   compliance frameworks and policy.

276   As of this writing, the configuration settings represent guidance and best practices from NIST SP
277   800-53 Revision 5 [5], NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2 [6], the macOS DISA Security Technical
278   Implementation Guide (STIG) [7], the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS)
279   Instruction (CNSSI) Number 1253 [8], and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical
280   Security Controls Version 8 [9], as well as internal organizational security guidance from NIST,
281   NASA, and LANL.

282   2.1       Project Goals

283   Apple releases a new macOS version every year, and generally, agencies and organizations must
284   wait for guidance or accept risk before deploying the new macOS version. Most agencies or
285   organizations must create their own internal security configuration, which delays deploying the
286   new macOS version or new hardware that only supports the new macOS version. The mSCP
287   assists organizations in upgrading sooner. The technical security settings in macOS generally do
288   not drastically change from release to release, with only a handful of new settings being
289   introduced. By pursuing a rules-based approach, mSCP rules that remain applicable can be
290   reused and incorporated into guidance for the latest macOS version. This enables quicker
291   adoption of new security features that are not offered in prior versions of macOS.

292   The goals of the mSCP are:
293         •    Develop recommended security baselines using a risk-based approach based on the
294              impact of the data
295         •    Normalize and accelerate annual adoption of the new operating system and hardware that
296              is specific to it by providing guidance to meet the security needs of new operating
297              systems at the earliest availability

                                                                                GUIDANCE FROM THE MSCP

298         •    Reduce worldwide effort in creating annual guidance by unifying and consolidating
299              compliance efforts into a single project
300         •    Develop a methodology to foster collaboration between baseline authors, reducing
301              overhead and redundancy
302         •    Establish a unified approach for configuration and assessment of controls across multiple
303              sources and tools
304         •    Enable the customization of existing content and the creation of new content, including
305              creating custom baselines in order to meet organization-specific security requirements
306         •    Provide device management and security tool vendors, auditors, and Apple insight into
307              customer security configuration needs

308   2.2       mSCP Content Use

309   mSCP content can be used by any organization to assist in setting and assessing the security
310   configuration of macOS systems. Security baselines can be made to map to existing guidance or
311   controls, such as those in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 [5], or they can be customized to meet an
312   organization’s specific needs. In mSCP terminology, a security baseline is represented as a
313   baseline file designating rules required to meet a specific set of requirements. The mSCP
314   provides a library of rules that are macOS settings. Each rule is mapped to a requirement within
315   a security standard, framework, etc. Baseline files and rules comprise much of the mSCP’s
316   content.

317   The mSCP offers several example baselines, including the following, with descriptions adapted
318   from FIPS 199 [10]:
319         •    The SP 800-53 Revision 5 low baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a system
320              defined as a low-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
321              availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational
322              operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
323         •    The SP 800-53 Revision 5 moderate baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a
324              system defined as a moderate-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality,
325              integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on
326              organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
327         •    The SP 800-53 Revision 5 high baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a system
328              defined as a high-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
329              availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on
330              organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

331   Organizations using any baseline example should take a risk-based approach for selecting the
332   appropriate settings and organizationally defined values depending on the context under which
333   the baseline will be applied. Organizations can tailor any of the baselines to include controls
334   specific to their needs and to produce evidence of control enforcement.

                                                                                                   GUIDANCE FROM THE MSCP

335   The mSCP provides scripts that can be used with baselines for several purposes, including the
336   following:
337        •    Creating scripts and profiles for configuring macOS
338        •    Generating a mapping between two security standards, regulations, frameworks, etc.
339        •    Producing human-readable documentation in a variety of formats
340        •    Customizing existing baselines

341   mSCP content can also be used to generate Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
342   content for automated security compliance scans. The SCAP generated follows the SCAP 1.3
343   specification [11]. Generation of SCAP content uses an Extensible Stylesheet Language
344   Transformations (XSLT) file to create an Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
345   (XCCDF) checklist document with an accompanying Open Vulnerability and Assessment
346   Language (OVAL) document.

347   The XCCDF and OVAL documents are bundled into an SCAP data stream collection document
348   with accompanying files that include Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) dictionary [12]
349   information and an Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) document. This creates an
350   SCAP 1.3 document that validates using the NIST SCAP Content Validation Tool 2 and can be
351   used by SCAP tools on macOS. More information on SCAP content generation is available at
352   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/SCAP-Content-Generation.

353   3         mSCP Components

354   This section provides an overview of several components of the mSCP: security baseline files,
355   configuration profiles and scripts, content generation scripts, customization capabilities, and
356   directories. More information about all of these is available from the GitHub wiki at
357   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki.

358   3.1       Security Baseline Files

359   In the mSCP, a security baseline is defined in a Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) file. A
360   YAML file is a human-readable file format commonly used by configuration files where data is
361   stored and/or transmitted. A baseline YAML file consists of the following required fields. The
362   code immediately below this list provides a partial example of a YAML file that illustrates the
363   use of these fields (with field names bolded).
364         •    title – a human-readable name for the baseline
365         •    description – a short description of the baseline, including its use case and target
366              operating system (OS) version
367         •    authors – developers of the baseline
368         •    profile – the security content portion of the baseline
369                 o   section – a keyword for organizing settings
370                 o   rules – the names of the rule files that are a part of this baseline

469   3.1.2   Rule File Categories

470   The mSCP organizes YAML files in the rules directory into the following subdirectories, each
471   corresponding to a category of settings:

      NIST SP 800-219 (DRAFT)                                              AUTOMATED SECURE CONFIGURATION
                                                                                  GUIDANCE FROM THE MSCP

472         •    audit – OpenBSM
473         •    auth – smartcard authentication
474         •    icloud – Apple’s iCloud/Apple ID service
475         •    os – settings that do not fit into the other categories
476         •    pwpolicy – password policy
477         •    sysprefs – settings controlled within the System Preferences application

478   The rules directory also includes a supplemental subdirectory, which contains additional
479   information that supports the guidance provided by the baselines. Supplemental content contains
480   information for rules that are not part of an existing baseline but could be beneficial for certain
481   use cases. Supplemental content may not have mappings and may or may not contain the YAML
482   rule file check and fix sections mentioned in Section 3.1.1. Supplemental content can be added to
483   enhance baselines where organizational requirements are different than the system baseline
484   requirements.

485   3.2       Configuration Profiles and Scripts

486   When an mSCP YAML file is processed, it yields a configuration script and/or configuration
487   profile (mobileconfig file) as outputs. Both are used to apply configuration settings to a system.

488   A configuration profile is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) formatted file with a
489   mobileconfig extension containing a configuration payload. macOS can automatically
490   configure itself based on a mobileconfig file’s contents upon execution. Configuration profiles
491   offer a convenient, Apple-supported mechanism for applying security settings to a macOS
492   environment. Additionally, they can be cryptographically signed to ensure integrity and
493   authenticity. These factors make configuration profiles the preferred vehicle for configuration
494   delivery. However, mobileconfig files cannot modify all macOS settings, so a configuration
495   script is needed for those that are not supported.

496   A configuration script is a shell script that manipulates operating system files directly. The script
497   content is derived from all YAML rule files that have a mobileconfig value of false and
498   belong to the specified baseline. The YAML rule file must contain the fix section in order to
499   generate its corresponding configuration script entry.

500   3.3       Content Generation Scripts

501   The mSCP provides several types of scripts for generating baselines, human-readable guidance,
502   baseline compliance checkers, and other types of content. Each script is described below.

503   3.3.1      Generate Baseline Script

504   The generate_baseline.py script compiles a list of security rules into a single baseline YAML
505   file. It can be used to modify an existing security baseline or create a new one. See
506   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Scripts#generate_baselinepy for additional
507   information.

                                                                              GUIDANCE FROM THE MSCP

508   3.3.2   Generate Guidance Script

509   The generate_guidance.py script can produce human-readable guidance as well as generate
510   the macOS Security Compliance Tool in the form of a Z shell script.

511   The generate_guidance.py script takes a baseline file and produces a human-readable guide in
512   the format of documentation from information available in the YAML rules files. The
513   documentation can be in any of several formats. The script always generates an Asciidoc file.
514   AsciiDoc (.adoc) is a plain text format that uses markup conventions for traditional document
515   formatting and organization. AsciiDoc files are easily transformable into many other formats via
516   the generate_guidance.py script, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), PDF, and
517   Excel. The Excel format is particularly useful for quickly viewing all the rules of a baseline, and
518   it contains all the data in the YAML rules files.

519   The generate_guidance.py script can also create configuration profiles (mobileconfig files)
520   and a compliance script. Using the -s argument, the generate_guidance.py script will
521   generate an org.{baseline}.audit.plist file and another script, the macOS Security
522   Compliance Tool that can check and remediate compliance settings. The audit.plist file can
523   be used to set an exemption to organizational rules for approved users so that compliance checks
524   can succeed without findings. To create an exemption for a rule, the exempt field should be set
525   to true and an exempt_reason should be added.

526   See https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Scripts#generate_guidancepy-script for
527   more information on the generate_guidance.py script.

528   3.3.3   macOS Security Compliance Tool

529   The {baseline}_compliance.sh script runs interactively by default. It can evaluate a system’s
530   conformance to a baseline or remediate any incorrectly configured settings. Alternatively, the
531   script can autonomously assess a system with the –check argument or automatically remediate
532   any possible settings with –fix.

533   The lines below provide an example of the results of running the script.
534   Thu Jan 21 15:09:41 UTC 2021 auth_pam_login_smartcard_enforce passed (Result:

547   3.3.4      OVAL Generation Script

548   The OVAL generation script, yaml-to-oval.py, takes a baseline YAML file and generates
549   OVAL checks for any rule file where possible. Note that this script does not recognize any
550   custom settings. For more information, see
551   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Scripts#yaml-to-ovalpy.

552   3.3.5      Generate Mapping Script

553   The generate_mapping.py script allows for the quick creation of custom rules and baselines for
554   a compliance framework not published by the mSCP. The script requires a user-created comma-
555   separated values (CSV) file containing control identifiers that maps to a new framework (CSV
556   column 1) from another already defined by the project (CSV column 2). By default, the script is
557   designed to map a framework to the NIST SP 800-53r5 [5] set of controls. Adding the -f
558   argument allows for mapping to another supported framework. See
559   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Generate-Mapping for more information on
560   the generate_mapping.py script.

561   3.4       Customization

562   Customization allows organizations to generate their own customized content outside of that
563   provided by the project. Additionally, it allows them to add content for internal-only controls,
564   which are not suitable for inclusion in a global baseline. Customization primarily takes place
565   within the custom folder. Here are examples of customization supported by mSCP:
566         •    Baselines: A baseline folder can be included within the custom folder to create
567              customized baselines that fit an organization’s needs. These baseline files may include
568              rule, section, and template customization (discussed below).
569         •    Rules: Existing rules can have their setting values overridden via the custom folder
570              instead of modifying the mSCP-supplied rule file. New rules can be created and added to
571              existing baselines or to user-defined baselines. Organizations can create their own
572              discussions, checks, results, fixes, and mappings of rules to security frameworks not
573              included in the project. In order to override an existing rule, the custom rule file name
574              must match an existing rule so the generate_guidance.py script will pick up the new
575              values. New rules not included in mSCP must be listed in the baseline YAML file
576              specified when running generate_guidance.py. Additional information on custom
577              rules can be found in an article written by mSCP contributor Allen Golbig [14].
578         •    Sections: Custom sections can be used to organize existing or custom YAML rule files.
579              Sections defined in the custom folder must be included in a baseline YAML file in order
580              to be used by generate_guidance.py.
581         •    Templates: Custom templates can be used to define new template structures for the
582              project and affect the organization and appearance of generated documentation. The
583              template files must match the name of an existing template and will override that
584              template when running generate_guidance.py.
585         •    Logos: An organization can include a custom logo when running the
586              generate_guidance.py script by using the -l argument to point to an image file.

603                   mSCP User Roles

604   The mSCP was designed to meet the needs of different security roles. These perspectives are
605   briefly examined below.

606   Security policy authors define the policies for their organizations. The customization and ease
607   of extensibility offered by the mSCP facilitate new content creation. Policy authors will need to
608   familiarize themselves with the YAML rule file format described in Section 3.1.1. Of particular
609   interest is the ability to map rules directly to references. Additionally, the generate mapping
610   script (Section 3.3.5) enhances portability between compliance frameworks.

611   System administrators and security professionals are responsible for configuring the systems
612   under their purview. They implement the guidance issued by security policy authors. As such,
613   configuration tools such as the macOS Security Compliance Tool’s (Section 3.3.3) automatic
614   remediation mode are of interest. Additionally, security professionals may wish to generate
615   baselines (Section 3.3.1), guidance (Section 3.3.2), and the macOS Security Compliance Tool
616   (Section 3.3.3).

617   Auditors approach macOS security compliance from a validator perspective, seeking proof that
618   a system is configured in the required way. They are more interested in system setting
619   documentation and compliance evidence than technical tools such as configuration scripts. Both
620   of these needs can be met by mSCP tools. The generate guidance script (Section 3.3.2) provides
621   the necessary documentation in a variety of formats including HTML, PDF, and Excel. The
622   macOS Security Compliance Tool (Section 3.3.3) assesses a system and produces a log of the
623   results. Additionally, some auditors may be interested in examining YAML rule content directly
624   (Section 3.1.1).

625   Information security officers have a variety of goals but are ultimately responsible for ensuring
626   that systems are configured according to their organizational requirements. To accomplish this,
627   they need policy documentation (Section 3.3.2) and the results of compliance scans (Section
628   3.3.3). Information security officers may also be responsible for reviewing the security rules
629   proposed by the policy authors. If this is the case, they may be interested in YAML rule file
630   components (Section 3.1.1).

631   Vendors of device management, security, configuration assessment, and compliance tools
632   can produce a series of audit files based on mSCP content to support different macOS versions
633   and associated security baselines. These audit files are maintained, tested, published, and
634   supported by the tool vendors. Tool customers can download and import the content into the tool
635   to assess the state of their system against a particular baseline in an automated way.

636   Specific audit files of the mSCP by tool vendors are described on the project wiki page. This
637   content will be updated as contributing tool vendors develop new audit content.

638                   Example of mSCP Usage by a Security Professional

639   This appendix provides examples of how a security professional might use mSCP content.
640   People in other roles might perform some of the same actions. The examples illustrated below
641   were accurate at the time of publication, but please see the mSCP wiki at
642   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki for up-to-date usage guidance. Note that the
643   mSCP scripts are not meant to replace enterprise-class configuration and management tools.
644   Configurations should be tested on development systems before being deployed on end users’
645   systems.

646   Preparing to use mSCP

647   All project components are available from the mSCP GitHub page [1] by navigating to
648   Releases and downloading the latest source code revision for the desired macOS version.
649   Alternatively, the project source code can be downloaded via git, as the example below
650   illustrates.




651
652   mSCP components rely on prerequisite software listed at
653   https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Getting-Started, so any missing software will
654   need to be installed.

655   Changing code branches and generating a baseline

656   After obtaining a copy of the source code, change directory to the mSCP git folder,
657   macos_security.




658
659   Next, select the appropriate code branch that corresponds to the target OS version. Then choose a
660   baseline and use the generate_baseline.py script to create a baseline YAML file. The
661   example below illustrates these steps for the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 moderate baseline for
662   macOS Big Sur.

663
664   Creating the macOS Security Compliance Tool and configuration profiles

665   Using the generate_guidance.py script, create the macOS Security Compliance Tool and
666   configuration profiles. The example below illustrates this, continuing from the previous example.




667
668   Running a compliance scan

669   As the example below shows, the macOS Security Compliance Tool is typically run with
670   administrator privileges so that it can access all the settings.



671
672   The example below shows the main menu presented by the macOS Security Compliance Tool.

674   Selecting option 2, “Run New Compliance Scan,” from the main menu launches the scan. The
675   example below shows output from the scan, which in this case reflects numerous rule failures,
676   each indicating a deviation from the expected configuration.




677
678   Selecting option 1, “View Last Compliance Report,” from the main menu displays a summary of
679   the compliance report results. The example below depicts results indicating that 30 tests passed
680   and 108 tests failed, for an overall score of 21.74% compliant.

682   Fixing non-compliant settings

683   Selecting option 3, “Run Commands to remediate non-compliant settings,” begins the process of
684   fixing non-compliant settings discovered during a previous compliance scan. The example below
685   illustrates the disclaimer to be reviewed and accepted before fixes are initiated. This disclaimer
686   indicates the potential risk in applying fixes.




687
688   After the disclaimer statement is accepted, the fixes are applied to the system, as the example
689   below illustrates.

691                   Example of mSCP Usage by an Assessment Tool Vendor

692   This appendix provides an example of how an assessment tool vendor converted mSCP content
693   to their tool’s proprietary format so their tool could perform compliance checks against mSCP
694   baselines and rules. Refer to the mSCP GitHub wiki page for the most current list of tool vendors
695   and associated content that will support the mSCP baselines.

696   This example is for Tenable, Inc. They automated the conversion of mSCP YAML rules into
697   their .audit format using Python and YAML libraries. Programmatically approaching this
698   conversion allows for faster future releases and greater consistency, and it also maintains the
699   integrity of the source content. Because the YAML content is all command-driven, it is
700   converted to Tenable’s CMD_EXEC check type for use with the Unix plugin. The YAML rules
701   have a “tags” section that was used to create unique audit profiles related to common
702   frameworks. An example of these profiles can be seen in the audit file naming convention:
703      •   NIST_macOS_Big_Sur_800-171_v1.4.0.audit
704      •   NIST_macOS_Catalina_800-53r5_high_v1.5.0.audit

705   See Tenable’s research highlight at
706   https://community.tenable.com/s/feed/0D53a00008E0hgYCAR for more details.

707   The following example shows a YAML-to-audit-check conversion. The content has been
708   condensed and abbreviated for the purposes of comparison:

713     If SSHD is enabled then it _MUST_ be configured to limit the ciphers to
714   algorithms that are FIPS 140 validated.
715   FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to
716   access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meet federal
717   requirements.
718   Operating systems utilizing encryption _MUST_ use FIPS validated mechanisms
719   for authenticating to cryptographic modules.
