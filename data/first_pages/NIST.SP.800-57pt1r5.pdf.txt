This publication has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST
is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.
Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This
publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject
to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
these new publications by NIST.

                                                                                                 In general, a single key shall be used for only one purpose (e.g., encryption, integrity

                                                                                                       1. The use of the same key for two different cryptographic processes may weaken the security
                                                                                                          provided by one or both of the processes.
                                                                                                       2. Limiting the use of a key limits the damage that could be done if the key is compromised.
                                                                                                       3. Some uses of keys interfere with each other. For example, consider a key pair used for both
                                                                                                          key transport and digital signatures. In this case, the private key is used as both a private

                                                                                                           then the cryptoperiod of the ephemeral public key does not end (from the perspective of

                                                                                                 This might be the case for several reasons, including:
                                                                                                    1. The cryptoperiod of the key has expired, and the keying material is no longer in operational

                                                                                                 saved somewhere or be constructible (e.g., derivable) from other available keying material. The

                                                                                                 (e.g., for the verification of MACs for archived documents); see Section 8.2.1. Key recovery may

                                                                                                 However, there are applications that may not need to save the keying material for an extended time

                                                                                                    1. If a lost key may have been compromised, then the key shall be replaced as soon as possible

                                                                                                       using the new key.
                                                                                                    2. If the key becomes inaccessible or has been modified, but compromise is not suspected,
                                                                                                       then the key may be recovered and used as discussed in Section 9.4.2.
                                                                                                 The following subsections provide discussions to assist an organization in determining whether or
                                                                                                 not key recovery is needed. Although the following discussions address only the recoverability of

                                                                                                 pair to apply digital signatures to information. The corresponding public key (the public signature-

                                                                                                 B.3.1.1    Private Signature Keys
                                                                                                 In general, private signature keys shall not be archived (see Table 9 in Section 8.3.1). Key backup
                                                                                                 is not usually desirable for the private key of a signing key pair since support for the non-

                                                                                                 replacing the private signature key and having its corresponding public signature-verification key
                                                                                                 distributed (in accordance with Section 8.1.5.1) in a timely manner may not be possible under
                                                                                                 some circumstances, so recovering the private signature key from backup storage may be justified.
                                                                                                 This may be the case, for example, for the private signature key of a CA.

                                                                                                    36. In Section 5.6.4, a paragraph has been inserted at the beginning about the strategy for

                                                                                                    37. In Section 6, the title has been changed to accommodate discussions on key information
                                                                                                        (rather than the less specific term cryptographic information). This is intended to raise

                                                                                                    42. In Section 6.2.1.3, “keying material” has been changed to a list of items to be kept secret:
                                                                                                        symmetric keys, private keys, key components, and secret metadata.
