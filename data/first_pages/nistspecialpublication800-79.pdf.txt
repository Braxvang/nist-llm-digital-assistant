EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification
Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, established a policy for all Federal
departments and agencies (hereafter “agencies”) to create and use a government-wide secure and
reliable form of identification for their Federal employees and contractors. It further specified
that this secure and reliable form of identification be issued only by service providers whose
reliability has been established by an official accreditation process. Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and
Contractors; NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity
Verification; NIST Special Publication 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal
Identity Verification; and NIST Special Publication 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key
Sizes for Personal Identity Verification (hereafter collectively called FIPS 201) specify the
requirements for an Integrated Circuit Card (i.e., a “Smart Card”) to be used as the secure and
reliable form (hereafter called a PIV Card) of identification.

The guidelines in this document should be used by Federal agencies issuing, or preparing to
issue, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards that comply with FIPS 201 to their Federal
employees and/or Federal contractor employees. These guidelines describe a set of attributes that
should be exhibited by a PIV Card Issuer (hereafter called a PCI) in order to be accredited. They
should be used by each agency for assessing the reliability of any organization providing its PCI
services.

These guidelines are patterned closely after those in NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security
Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems. SP 800-37 provides guidance
for certifying and accrediting the security of information systems. This document, SP 800-79,
provides guidance for certifying and accrediting the reliability of a PCI. Note that use of SP 800-
79 for accrediting the reliability of a PCI must be done in addition to accrediting the security of
computer systems used by the PCI by using SP 800-37 and SP 800-53 as guidance.

Specifically, these guidelines are intended to help Federal agency officials—

   •   Satisfy the requirement in HSPD-12 that all identity cards be issued by providers whose
       reliability has been established by an official accreditation process;

   •   Answer several questions about the PCI including— Does the PCI Manager and staff
       understand the requirements specified in FIPS 201? Can the PCI reliably provide the
       required services? Are the PCI processes implemented as designed and are they
       adequately documented in the PCI operations plan? Is there credible evidence to believe
       that the operations plan will be implemented as designed?

   •   Ensure more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of the required attributes
       of PCI’s;

   •   Ensure more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals for controlling
       the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and
       information systems; and


                                               Page 1
   •   Facilitate informed PCI accreditation decisions without significant delay or use of
       resources.

It is essential that agency officials have complete, accurate and trustworthy information about
their PCI in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize its
operation. Certification in this context means a formal process of assessing the attributes of a
PCI using various methods of assessment that verify that a PCI is reliable and capable of
enrolling approved applicants and issuing PIV Cards.

Accreditation of a PCI is the official management decision of a Designated Accreditation
Authority (DAA) to authorize operation of a PCI after determining that the PCI’s reliability has
satisfactorily been established through appropriate assessment and certification processes.
Accreditation provides one form of quality control and helps to assure that managers and the
technical staff of a PCI will implement procedures compliant with FIPS 201 and assure that all
its provisions are satisfied on a continuing basis. Certification directly supports accreditation by
providing the DAA with important information necessary to make credible decisions on whether
to authorize an organization to issue PIV Cards or to continue its PIV Card issuing operations.

The certification and accreditation processes consist of four phases: Initiation Phase,
Certification Phase, Accreditation Phase, and Monitoring Phase. Each phase consists of a set of
tasks that are to be carried out by specified agency officials (e.g., DAA, PCI Manager) and their
authorized support personnel.

Accreditation should be conducted in a manner that ensures— (i) continued reliability of the PCI
and its offered services; (ii) ongoing monitoring of management and quality assurance controls;
and (iii) that re-accreditation occurs periodically in accordance with agency policy and whenever
a significant change is made to the system or its operational environment.

Several models of a PIV Card issuing organization are possible. A centralized model and
distributed model are described. The primary responsibilities of a PCI include identity proofing
and registration, PIV Card Creation and Issuance, and PIV Card Life Cycle Management. The
certification and accreditation activities specified in this document cover all these operations
whether they are in a single organization or distributed across several organizations.

If one agency would like to use the services of a PCI of a second agency, the first agency should
review the second agency’s PIV policies and the PCI’s operations plan, accreditation package,
and Authorization to Operate. If acceptable the client agency may utilize the services of the
server agency’s PCI without re-accreditation.

Certain roles and responsibilities may be delegated and/or contracted. Specific time periods are
specified for re-accreditation and providing PIV services under an Interim Authorization to
Operate. These are specified in appropriate sections of the Guidelines. Some services of a PCI
may be accredited and provided without requiring that all potential services be accredited and
provided. In particular, PIV-I services should be accredited for a PCI when they are available but
before they are provided. PIV-II services should be accredited for a PCI as they become
available and added to PIV-I service offerings. Appropriate PCI attribute and assessment
methods should be selected by the SAO and the DAA and used for partial service accreditations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification
Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, established a Federal policy to create and use
a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for Federal employees and
contractors. It further specified secure and reliable identification that—

   •   Is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employee’s identity;

   •   Is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation;

   •   Can be rapidly authenticated electronically;

   •   Is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
       accreditation process.

From the HSPD-12 objectives, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal
Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, derived more specific objectives of
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card issuing organizations (hereafter called a PCI or Issuer)
including that—

   •   A PIV Card is issued only— (i) to an individual whose true identity has been verified; (ii)
       subsequent to a request to process an Applicant for a PIV Card by an authorized authority
       (e.g., employer, sponsor); and (iii) after an authorized authority (e.g., registrar) has
       authorized issuance of the Card;

   •   Only an individual with an acceptable background check which satisfies the requirements
       of FIPS 201 is issued a Card;

   •   An individual is issued a Card only after presenting two acceptable, authentic “identity
       source documents,” at least one of which is a valid Federal or State government issued
       picture ID;

   •   Fraudulent or altered identity source documents are not accepted as being authentic;

   •   Any person suspected by, or known to, the government as being a terrorist is not issued a
       Card;

   •   No substitution of one person for another can occur in the identity proofing and PIV Card
       issuing processes. Specifically, the individual who applies for a PIV Card, who submits
       identity source documents, who appears for identity proofing, whose fingerprints are
       checked against applicable databases, and who appears to obtain an issued PIV Card shall
       be the same person as the one to whom the PIV Card is issued;

   •   No single individual in a PCI acting alone is authorized or technically capable of issuing
       a PIV Card or is able to cause one to be issued.

The objectives of the guidelines in this document include—

                                                Page 3
       •    Establishing the attributes required and desired of organizations in order to reliably
            perform appropriate identity “proofing” and issuing of PIV Cards to Federal and
            contractor employees;

       •    Describing methods for determining if a PIV issuer exhibits the required attributes; and

       •    Providing guidance to Federal agencies in establishing or obtaining the services of a PCI
            whose reliability is accredited.

These guidelines describe a set of attributes required to be exhibited by a PIV issuer in order to
be accredited as well as other attributes that are considered highly desirable. They are intended to
be used by an agency to assess a PCI’s capabilities and reliability to perform the required
services described in FIPS 201.

Certification of a PIV Card issuing organization is a formal process of assessing the attributes
(availability, capability, and possessing adequately supported facilities, personnel, equipment,
finances and support infrastructures) of a PCI using various methods of assessment (e.g.,
interviews, document reviews, laboratory test results, procedure evaluations, component
validation reports) that support the assertion that a PIV Card issuing organization is reliable and
capable of enrolling approved applicants and issuing PIV Cards in accordance with FIPS 201.
Accreditation of a PCI is the official management decision of the Designated Accreditation
Authority (DAA) to authorize operation of a PCI after determining that the PCI’s reliability has
satisfactorily been established through appropriate assessment and certification processes.
These guidelines do not specifically cover certifying and accrediting the security of computer
systems, PIV system components, access control systems utilizing PIV services, or the network
comprising the PIV Card management system. These activities should be performed in
accordance with NIST SP 800-37 in addition to those specified in this document.

1.1 Intended Audience
These guidelines are intended for any Federal agency issuing or preparing to issue PIV Cards to
Federal employees and/or Federal contractor employees. HSPD-12 requires that all PIV Cards
be issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process.

2.0 THE FUNDAMENTALS
This chapter reviews fundamentals of certification and accreditation of PIV Issuing
organizations.

Accreditation is a term that is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings.
University departments are often accredited to provide assurance that graduates have capabilities
equivalent with those of similarly accredited departments. Testing laboratories may be
accredited to demonstrate that their results are equivalent with others similarly accredited. One
goal of PCI accreditation is to demonstrate that the capability and reliability of PCIs are
appropriate and adequate. Another goal of PCI accreditation is to authorize a PCI to create and
issue PIV Cards whose security is equivalent with those issued by other PCIs. Finally, PIV
Cards created by an accredited PCI should be trusted and acceptable to other organizations so
that access control decisions can be made relying on the accuracy of the information on the PIV
Card.

2.1 Certification and Accreditation
Accreditation is required for PCIs by HSPD-12, and will serve the interests of the entire Federal
government if performed appropriately. Accreditation can assist in establishing a common level
of trust among agencies for PIV Cards. Good physical and logical access control begin with
establishing the correct identity of a person and then subsequently verifying that it is still the
same person to whom specific credentials (e.g., the physical PIV Card, Applicant-unique data
stored in and on the Card) and authorizations (e.g., access privileges) have been issued.

Certification provides the DAA with important information necessary to make credible decisions
on whether to authorize an organization to issue PIV Cards or to continue its PIV Card issuing
operations. This information is produced by assessing various attributes and operations of the
organization to determine if the issuer is reliable and that the required services are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes.

The certification and accreditation (including re-accreditation) processes consist of four phases:

   •   Initiation Phase

   •   Certification Phase

   •   Accreditation Phase

   •   Monitoring Phase

Each phase consists of tasks that should be carried out by responsible agency officials (e.g., an
agency’s DAA, PCI Manager) and their designated and authorized support personnel.

The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) resource identification; and (iii)
plan analysis and acceptance. The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the appropriate agency
officials participate in the preparation and design of a new PIV Card issuing system or review of
an existing PIV Card issuing system.

                                                Page 6
The Certification Phase consists of two tasks: (i) performing assessments of the attributes of the
PCI; and (ii) preparing certification documentation. This phase is to determine the extent to
which the requirements of FIPS 201 are being achieved using the selected assessment methods
and verifying that they are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcomes. This phase includes recommending actions to be taken to correct deficiencies
and discrepancies found during the assessment. Upon successful completion of this phase, the
risk associated with the agency’s PCI operations should have been determined, documented, and
a recommendation made to the DAA regarding accrediting the capability and reliability of the
PCI.

The Accreditation Phase consists of two tasks: (i) making an accreditation decision; and (ii)
preparing accreditation documentation. The DAA should review the certification documentation
and the recommendation prepared by the certification agent(s). Following the review, the DAA
should prepare a letter (see Appendix D for examples) regarding operation of the PCI and a
transmittal letter similar to the example in Appendix D. The alternatives include— (i) full
authorization to operate (e.g., perform identity proofing, enroll PIV Applicants, and issue PIV
Cards); (ii) interim authorization to operate (i.e., perform these services under specific terms and
conditions); or (iii) denial of authorization to operate (i.e., the PCI may not perform PIV
services).

The Monitoring Phase consists of three tasks: (i) PCI management and control review; (ii) PCI
status monitoring; and (iii) PCI status reporting and documentation. This phase provides
continued oversight and ensures that monitoring of PCI operations are being conducted
appropriately, and informs the appropriate agency officials when changes will occur or have
occurred that may impact the capability and reliability of the PCI. The activities in this phase
should be ongoing as long as the PIV Card issuing process is in place.

Certification and accreditation should be an integral part of a dynamic, ongoing management
process. It should be stressed to a PCI that good information and facility security not only
includes establishing and verifying a claimed identity but also the creation of processes to protect
that identity and related information in identifiable form (IIF) through trusted procedures and
technically enforced processes in accordance with FIPS 201, FISMA, and other applicable
policies and standards of good practice. A PCI is authorized to operate for a specific time
depending on its accreditation status. The inevitable changes to any organization (including
policy, procedures, equipment, and people) and the potential impact of those changes may
require structured monitoring of the organization on an ongoing basis. Thus, the initial
accreditation needs to be followed by monitoring that— (i) tracks changes to the PCI; (ii)
analyzes the impact of those changes; and (iii) reports the status of the PCI changes to
appropriate agency officials.

The following questions should be answered during the monitoring phase—

   •   Have there been changes made to the PCI, its environment, or its automated support
       systems that could affect the PCI’s services or reliability?

   •   If so, would the resulting operational environment or status be unacceptable?

   •   When will re-accreditation be required?

                                               Page 7
Since the cost of certification and accreditation can be substantial, it is important to leverage the
results of previous assessments that have been conducted when applicable and creditable.

2.2 Roles and Responsibilities
The following sections describe the roles and responsibilities of key participants (see Figures 1-
3) involved in the certification and accreditation of a PCI.2 Recognizing that agencies have
widely varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming
conventions for certification and accreditation-related roles and how the associated
responsibilities are allocated among agency personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single
role or one individual filling multiple roles3). However, the basic functions remain the same.
The certification and accreditation processes described in these guidelines allow agencies to
achieve the goals of specific tasks within their organizational structures in a way that best
support their access control systems.

Senior Authorizing Official
The Senior Agency Official (SAO) (see Figure 2) is responsible for the establishment, budget,
and oversight of the PIV functions and services of an agency.

Designated Accreditation Authority
The Designated Accreditation Authority (DAA) is a senior agency official with the authority to
formally accredit the reliability of PCIs as required by HSPD-12.

PCI Manager
The PCI Manager (may be called an Agency Identity Management Official) is responsible for
ensuring that all the services specified in FIPS 201 are provided reliably and that PIV Cards are
produced and issued in accordance with its requirements.

Certification Agent
The Certification Agent (CA) should be an individual, group, or organization that has the
appropriate skills, resources, and competencies to perform certifications (i.e., comprehensive
assessments) of a PCI. The CA should identify discrepancies between the current status of the
PCI and the requirements of FIPS 201, and present them to the PCI Manager who will prepare
recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate the discrepancies. The CA should review
the corrective actions, report if they are adequate or not, and then ensure that the final set of
acceptable corrective actions are properly applied. Prior to initiating the activities of the
certification process, the CA provides a plan to ensure that a realistic assessment of the current
reliability of the PCI will be obtained.

To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of certifications, the CA should be independent of,
and organizationally separate from, the persons and the office(s) directly responsible for the day-

2
    Agencies may define other significant roles (e.g., government-wide PIV System liaisons, facilities managers, and operations
    managers) to support the PIV Card issuing organization certification and accreditation processes.
3
    No one individual should perform multiple roles in performing the certification and accreditation processes.


                                                               Page 8
to-day operation of the PCI. The CA should also be independent of those individuals responsible
for correcting deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the certification phase. The
independence of the CA is an important factor in assessing the credibility of the assessment
results and ensuring that the DAA receives objective information in order to make an informed
accreditation decision.

PIV Card Applicant Representative
A PIV Card Applicant Representative represents the interests of current or prospective Federal
employees and contractors who are the Applicants for PIV Cards. They should represent the
privacy concerns of applicants, assist an applicant who is denied a PIV Card because of missing
or incorrect information in an Identity Source document, or act as a surrogate for an applicant
that is not available for performing required actions. These representatives should be interviewed
during certification to assess if the rights of Applicants are being protected and that all
Applicants obtain useful information or assistance when desired.

Agency Official for Privacy
The role of the Agency Official for Privacy (AOP) is defined in FIPS 201 and may not assume
any other operational role in the PIV system. The AOP oversees privacy-related matters in the
PIV system and should work with the PIV Card Applicant Representative to ensure that the
rights of Applicants and PIV Subscribers (approved Applicants who have been issued a PIV
Card) are protected.

Delegation of Roles
Each agency should document its PIV certification and accreditation program, the operational
plan to be performed by its PIV Card issuing organization, and the geographical facility and
organizational model it has chosen. The SAO should document all the responsibilities, roles, and
procedures to be followed by the PCI and the certification and accreditation processes selected to
be used. The SAO should appoint, if they have not been previously appointed, qualified
individuals as the DAA, the Certification Agent(s), and the PCI Facility Manager for each
facility (i.e., location) that will be issuing PIV Cards. This selection will depend upon the FIPS
201 Appendix A Model selected, the appropriate roles required of the model, and the detailed
PIV credentials and technical details chosen. At the discretion of the SAO, certain certification
and accreditation responsibilities may be delegated to individuals and organizations, including
contractors. The SAO, DAA, and CAs should be Federal employees. All other roles should
serve under the auspices and oversight of the SAO. Table 1 designates different roles involved
in C&A and the two models specified in FIPS 201 Appendix A. Note that no correspondence is
implied among the rows of the table.

Sample PIV Card Issuing Organizations
Each agency could have a different structure for the organization that it establishes or uses for
issuing PIV Cards. Figure 1 provides a logical view of the PIV system. Agency A is shown
with its own PCI. The PCI uses a computer support system or systems connected to a network to
communicate with peer PCI support systems and access control systems. Agencies B and C have
chosen to utilize the services of a shared PCI and its associated support systems. Agency D is
large and geographically distributed and therefore has multiple (two are shown) PCIs. The DAA
for each agency is responsible for accrediting the reliability of the PCI or PCIs used.

 A simple model of a centralized PCI is depicted in Figure 2. This model could be used by a
small, centralized agency that does not have remote facilities. An SAO has, or is assigned, the
responsibility for creating or obtaining the services of a PCI. Several of the roles and
responsibilities established by FIPS 201 can be fulfilled by one person, multiple people, or an
entire organization. Most agencies will already have an AOP, a DAA and one or more
Certification Agents. They may be assigned additional responsibilities for the PIV processes if
appropriate. Agencies may already have a person or an organization for physical building access
identity badges, for information systems access control, or both. The sample organization shows
the services of Applicant identity proofing, registration, and Card issuance (including life cycle
management) to be under a single manager but these responsibilities could be fulfilled by
different managers with a coordinator or senior manager. For accreditation, the organizational
structure is not as important as ensuring that there is a formal structure with clear lines of
authority and the PCI is assessed for reliability assurance before PIV Cards are issued.

Figure 3 depicts a model of a distributed PCI. This model could be used by a large,
geographically distributed agency having several remote facilities. A senior agency official that
has jurisdiction and authority over all the facilities is depicted at the top of the organizational
chart. An agency-wide DAA is shown that would be responsible for reviewing all the
certification documentation of each of the PCI facilities and issuing an appropriate accreditation
decision and documentation for each. However, each of the other roles is shown having one
person or organization serving an agency-wide role (e.g., the AOP) with staff at each facility
performing that role locally. These guidelines should be interpreted within the context of each
agency, its mission(s), its organization structure, its geographical location(s), and its automated
systems when selecting and performing the certification and accreditation procedures that are
appropriate for that agency and its PCI(s) and using those that will provide the highest
expectation of producing an accurate assessment of reliability.

2.3 Accreditation Decisions
Accreditation recommendations resulting from certification processes should be conveyed to the
DAA by the CA. To ensure the agency’s business and operational needs are fully considered,
the DAA should meet with the CA and the PCI Manager prior to issuing an accreditation
decision to discuss the certification findings and the terms and conditions of the authorization.
There are three accreditation alternatives that can be rendered by the DAA:

   •   Authorization to operate;

   •   Interim authorization to operate; or

   •   Denial of authorization to operate.

Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the certification phase assessments, the DAA deems that PCI
exhibits all the required attributes to an acceptable degree, an authorization to operate (ATO) is
issued. The PCI is authorized to perform without restrictions or limitations those services that
have been certified as being reliable. Re-accreditation should occur at the discretion of the DAA
when significant changes occur in the PCI’s status or within a specified time period (three years
is recommended).

Interim Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the certification phase assessments, the DAA deems that the
discrepancies are significant but there is an overarching mission necessity to allow the PIV issuer
to operate, an interim authorization to operate (IATO) may be issued. An interim authorization
to operate is rendered when the identified deficiencies in PCI procedures are significant but can
be addressed in a timely manner. An interim authorization is an authorization to operate under
specific terms and conditions. Re-accreditation should be initiated within three (3) months. PIV
Cards issued during the Interim Authorization to Operate period should be noted in the PIV
system so that agencies may determine if a requested access should be granted. No more than
two (2) consecutive Interim Authorizations to Operate may be granted for a PCI. Failure to
correct deficiencies for a third period should result in a Denial of Authorization to Operate.

A PCI is not considered accredited during the interim authorization to operate. When the
deficiencies have been corrected, the interim authorization should be lifted and the PCI should be
accredited. Monitoring phase activities should focus on the identified deficiencies. Significant
changes in the status of the PCI that occur during the period of limited authorization to operate
should be reported immediately to the DAA.

Denial of Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the certification phase assessments, the DAA deems operation of
the PCI to be unacceptable, a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) is transmitted to the PCI
Manager. The PCI is not accredited and PIV Cards should not be issued. If the PCI is currently


                                              Page 13
in operation, all issuance of PIV Cards should be halted. If the PCI was previously accredited
and had issued PIV Cards under a ATO, the PIV Cards issued since the last accreditation should
be marked in the PIV System (not on the Cards themselves) with a code that may be read by an
access control system and used in making a decision to grant or deny a requested access. Cards
so marked may be reviewed by an accredited PCI and the encoded mark in the PIV System may
be removed if the Card’s information and the Subscriber’s identity are found to be correct.
Failure to receive authorization to operate indicates that there are major deficiencies in the
required attributes of the PCI. The DAA, CA, or their designated representatives should work
with the PCI manager to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct the deficiencies.

2.4 Accreditation Package and Supporting Documentation
The accreditation package documents the results of the certification phase and provides the
DAA with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to
authorize operation of the PCI. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the DAA, the PCI
Manager is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and submission of the accreditation
package. The accreditation package contains the following documents:

      •    PCI’s operational plan

      •    PCI’s assessment reports

      •    PCI’s corrective action plan

The PCI’s operations plan that is prepared by the PCI Manager and previously approved by the
SAO should specify all the requirements for issuing PIV Cards and describes the processes in
place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan should also contain supporting
material and identity management related documents such as the PCI’s privacy policy for
Applicants, descriptions of management procedures for assuring continued reliable operations,
and all agreements with agencies regarding using the services of the PCI.

The PCI’s attribute assessment reports, prepared by the certification agent, provide the results of
assessing the required attributes of the PCI to determine the extent to which the attributes are
exhibited now and expected to continue during future operations. The assessment report should
also contain recommended corrective actions if deficiencies or discrepancies are found.

The corrective action plan (CAP), which is prepared by the PCI Manager, describes the
measures that are being implemented— (i) to correct deficiencies noted during the assessment;
and (ii) to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities to the creation and issuance of secure PIV Cards.

The Manager submits the accreditation package to the DAA.4 Figure 4 illustrates the primary
sections of the accreditation package.

    Accreditation packages may be submitted in either paper or electronic format. Appropriate measures should be employed to
    protect the information contained in accreditation packages (electronic or paper format) in accordance with agency policy.

The accreditation decision letter transmits the accreditation decision from the DAA to the PCI
Manager. The accreditation decision letter contains the following information:

   •   Accreditation decision;

   •   Supporting rationale for the decision; and

   •   Terms and conditions for the authorization.

The accreditation decision letter (see Appendix D for examples) indicates to the PCI Manager
whether the PIV Card issuing system is— (i) authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on
an interim basis; or (iii) not authorized to operate. The supporting rationale includes the
justification for the DAA’s decision. The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a
description of any limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the PCI. The
accreditation decision letter is attached to the original accreditation package and provided to the
PCI. A copy of the decision letter and the transmittal letter should be e-mailed to
PIVaccreditation@nist.gov.

Upon receipt of the accreditation decision letter and accreditation package, the PCI manager
should review the terms and conditions of the authorization. The DAA should also retain a copy
of the accreditation decision letter and accreditation package. The certification and
accreditation-related documentation (especially information dealing with vulnerabilities) should
be— (i) marked and protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy; and (ii) retained
in accordance with the agency’s record retention policy.

3.0 ATTRIBUTES OF PCIS AND ASSESSMENT METHODS
This chapter discusses the attributes that should be assessed when determining a PCI’s reliability
and the ability to comply with the requirements of FIPS 201.

3.1 Attributes
HSPD-12 requires that all PIV Cards be issued by providers whose reliability has been
established through an official accreditation process. Reliability is the primary attribute to be
exhibited and accredited in a PCI and is the characteristic of an organization that requires
functions be performed and services provided as expected and that this expectation will continue
in the future. A PCI’s reliability should be evaluated and established by assessing that it is—

   •   Knowledgeable— the characteristic of a person or organization of having both the ability
       and capacity of understanding all the management, documentation, document control,
       work flow, privacy, security, technical foundation, data, devices, communications, and
       electronic processing requirements in FIPS 201;

   •   Capable— the characteristic of a person or organization of possessing the management,
       personnel, facilities, equipment, funding, and technical abilities of performing the
       required services of FIPS 201 including development of a plan, initiation of required
       acquisitions and initiation of corrective actions as appropriate.

   •   Accountable—the requirement of a person or organization for accepting responsibility
       for assigned tasks and then being held personally or organizationally responsible for
       performing the tasks successfully or for accepting the results of failing to accomplish
       them.

   •   Available— the characteristic that required functions and services will be performed, by
       the PCI, whenever desired by the consumer or customer.

   •   Legal— operating within all the applicable laws.

   •   Compliant— operating consistent with, and utilizing as required, all applicable policies,
       standards, rules, and regulations.

   •   Well Managed— possessing the abilities needed to plan, initiate, coordinate, and provide
       services required by FIPS 201 with the cooperation and support of all its operations
       personnel and staff.

   •   Trustworthy—the characteristic of a person or organization in which their statements
       may be accepted as being true without question and that their functions will be performed
       and services provided as advertised or expected.

   •   Adequately supported— having the personnel, facilities, equipment, finances, and
       support infrastructures needed to perform assigned duties and fulfill responsibilities.



                                              Page 16
   •   Secure—the characteristic of a person, organization, facility, or information system that
       safety, valuable asset protection, and sensitive and critical information assurance will be
       provided to the level desired and expected.

The following desired attributes of a PCI should similarly be exhibited and assessed—

   •   Prepared/responsive/efficient— characteristics of a person or organization exhibiting
       proper planning to be able to perform a service, capable of responding to it in a normal or
       expedited requests, and able to perform it without undue expenditure of time or
       resources.

   •   Cost effective— characteristic of a product, service, person, or organization that the cost
       for obtaining a product or service or using a person or organization to perform a service is
       proportional to the value of the product or service.

   •   Adaptable— able to change to exhibit new characteristics, perform new services, use
       new technology, and operate in new environments as requirements change.

   •   Cooperative—characteristic of a person or organization to work with other people or
       organizations in performing a service without causing delay, anxiety, or frustration.

These organizational attributes or characteristics are not independent. They are defined to
provide a foundation of attributes of a PCI that would meet the requirements of most agencies
and satisfy the consumers of the offered services.

Accreditation based on assessment of these attributes is intended to assist an agency determine
that the PCI services and operations will be conducted in an acceptable, consistent and
predictable manner. The certification and accreditation processes to be performed initially and
periodically thereafter should use the recommended and additional selected methods of assessing
the attributes, determine if they are presently in, and adequately exhibited by, the PCI now and
determine if they will be reasonably expected to continue in the future. If the results of these
processes are positive, an approval to operate should be issued by the DAA and the accreditation
requirement of HSPD-12 should be considered satisfied. If one or more of the required attributes
are not present or not expected to continue in the future, then accreditation should be postponed
or denied. If postponed, an action plan for improving the attribute or removing discrepancies
between expectations and assessment should be produced and implemented within three months.
Re-accreditation should then be initiated.

3.2 Assessment Methods
The following methods of assessment are described in the context of being used to determine if
the required attributes of a PCI are adequately exhibited in order to achieve successful
accreditation. They are common methods of assessing or evaluating an organization and
comparing one organization with others seeking to provide products or services to consumers
and customers. The following descriptions may be used by a DAA in selecting appropriate
methods for establishing that the required attributes of the PCI are present.



                                              Page 17
   •   Review and analysis— broad methods of assessment that may be applied to most
       attributes but are best applied to reviewing documents (plans, policies, rules) and
       analyzing them in accordance with applicable standards.

   •   Interview— direct conversation with an assessment subject in which both pre-
       established and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
       encouraged, and conclusions reached.

   •   Demonstration/Observation— a product producer or service provider showing an
       assessor how a product works or a service is performed.

   •   Sampling/statistics— actively selecting relevant process information in accordance with
       a statistical sampling plan in order to verify that the functions or services produced on an
       on-going basis also satisfy the initial requirements.

   •   Evaluation/Measurement— analyzing an attribute of a product, service, or organization
       using a metric that is selected to produce a result useful for assessing a quality and
       reliability.

   •   Compliance/conformance with standards— analyzing a product, service, or
       organization to determine if the specified standards are being followed appropriately.

   •   Precedence/Accepted Practice— assessing an attribute and deeming it acceptable
       because it has been successfully used previously by others or has been used so frequently
       that it has become a de facto standard.

   •   Comparison with peers— assessing an attribute of a person or organization by
       comparing the result of an assessment with that of a similar person or organization;
       comparing the certification and accreditation documentation and results of one PCI
       against those of others to seek equivalence in operational capability and reliability and
       trust.

   •   Experience— assessing one or more attributes of an organization based on evaluating
       previously provided products or services similar or identical to those required by FIPS
       201.

   •   Testing/validation— actively testing a product or service against a set of specifications
       using applicable test methods and metrics; validation is testing against a standard; PIV
       Cards produced by a PCI may be tested for quality and may be validated against the
       specifications of FIPS 201.

The methods of assessment described above should be used to verify that a PCI exhibits all
required attributes in order to become accredited. The desirable attributes should also be
assessed and included in a certification report but accreditation should not be denied if they are
not adequately exhibited.




                                               Page 18
4.0 PCI FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS
The attributes and methods of assessment described in chapter three should be used to assess the
reliability of PCI functions and operations. The primary PCI functions are overviewed in this
document to give the DAA information about the expected operations needed to support services
provided by a PCI. Certification and accreditation processes should look to determine the
reliability of these functions and operations. Detailed technical specifications and service
descriptions required of a PCI are provided in FIPS 201, and additional information is provided
in the FICC Identity Management Handbook.

4.1 Planning
A PCI Manager plays a significant role and has major responsibilities in planning, initiating,
operating, and managing a PCI to service one or more agencies. The Manager must have a plan
for the design, implementation and operation of the PIV Card issuing system, the performance of
the required PIV Card Issuing services, and the management of all required support activities of
the organization including certification and accreditation. In addition, the Manager must be able
to create a corrective actions plan to correct any deficiencies discovered in the organization
during the certification phase. The Manager must be knowledgeable about the requirements of
HSPD-12 and FIPS 201, be organized in having access to the needed documents, and be
qualified to carry out all responsibilities of the position.

The Manager should be interviewed to assess his knowledge and skills, and the documentation of
the organization should be reviewed and analyzed by the CA.

4.2 Documentation
A PCI is required to collect, organize, store, and disseminate many documents important to its
operations. The Manager and staff must be knowledgeable of the documentation requirements,
including protection of the privacy of the Card Applicants and proper handling of the identity
source documents. Appropriate references listed in Appendix A should be reviewed and
analyzed to assure that the organization is operating in accordance with legal and standards
requirements. Document management should be patterned after other experienced PCIs to show
adherence to precedence. All of the documentation should be kept current.

   •   Plans— includes PCI’s operational plan and the corrective action plan resulting from
       certification activities.

   •   Policies— includes the PIV Privacy requirements as specified in section 2.4 of FIPS 201
       and information security policies relevant to the organization.

   •   Standards and Guidelines— includes all FIPS and NIST Guidelines relevant to the
       organization as well as international, national, and industry standards applicable to the
       services and operations of the organization, especially those related to PIV Cards as
       specified in FIPS 201 and NIST SP 800-73, biometric characteristics of people as
       specified in NIST SP 800-76, and cryptography as specified in NIST SP 800-78.



                                              Page 19
   •   Identity source documents— PIV Card Applicants must supply identity source
       documents as specified in FIPS 201 so that a PCI can prove that their identity is authentic
       and can be verified by the originators of the documents. These documents must be stored
       in a manner that assures that their contents are protected, used only for authorized
       purposes, and be able to be retrieved at some later time for re-verification if needed.

   •   Forms/Reports— Various forms will be used to obtain information and reports will be
       produced to provide information. Agency officials may obtain or provide information in
       various ways without resorting to developing new forms whose formats may require prior
       approval.

The most appropriate assessment methods include review and analysis of said documentation.

4.3 Implementation
Subsequent to planning the services and documenting the needed operations of a PCI, the PCI
Manager implements the operations plan. The following items should be addressed in the plan
and will be assessed during the certification phase of the PCI.

Personnel
Obtaining knowledgeable, qualified, trustworthy, honest, and reliable personnel for the PCI is the
first task of the PCI Manager. These people may already be operating the existing agency
identity badge management system and may need only to be trained in the requirements of FIPS
201 and indoctrinated in the new policy of HSPD-12 in order to perform reliably in the new PCI.
They will need to be organized in a structure that supports the requirements of FIPS 201 and to
be assigned the roles and responsibilities specified in that standard. Assessments of the required
attributes of the PCI personnel may include interviews, direct observation, and testing for
knowledge of FIPS 201 and organizational policy requirements.

Facilities
Adequate facilities are required to house and support—

   •   Personnel (Note— All actions pertaining to personnel recommended in these guidelines
       should be coordinated with appropriate agency Human Resource Management
       organizations.),

   •   Storage of vital and sensitive records,

   •   Test systems and associated components (Hardware/software/firmware), and

   •   Other operational components.

The most appropriate assessment methods include review and analysis of plans for facilities,
interviewing the operations staff, assessing the security of IIF storage facilities, and testing the
computer system components in accordance with FIPS 201 requirements.




                                                 Page 20
Equipment
Obtaining adequate and reliable equipment to support the services provided by the PCI is
fundamental to success of its operations. Demonstration and testing equipment will be needed to
assure that PIV Card stock meets FIPS 201 specifications when obtained from the supplier; that
PIV Card Readers/Writers are able to initialize the supplied cards; that the biometric data can be
captured from the Applicant and entered into the Integrated Circuit “Chip” memory in the PIV
Cards; that required software, credentials, and data can be loaded securely; and that completed
PIV Cards will operate properly when issued. Assessments of the required attributes include
review and analysis of plans for equipment to meet FIPS requirements, and ensuring that PIV
system components have received validation certificates from NIST accredited testing
laboratories.

Procurement
If adequate personnel, facilities, or equipment are not available, they must be procured by the
PCI. Procurement includes personnel transfers, acquiring additional staff if needed,
establishment of support contracts, and purchasing or leasing of equipment. Procurement must
be conducted in a manner that assures that reliable personnel services are obtained and that
reliable and conformant equipment is obtained. These attributes may be assessed through
interviews, demonstrations, direct observations and evaluations. Precedence of demonstrated
capability and reliability of service providers and successful previous assessments attesting to
these attributes may be used to assess the success of procurement. (Note— All action pertaining
to procurement recommended in these guidelines should be coordinated with appropriate agency
procurement organizations.)

4.4 Operation
A critical aspect of the certification and accreditation processes is the post-accreditation period
involving the monitoring of the operations and status of the PCI. An effective monitoring
program requires—

   •   Configuration management processes;

   •   Review and analysis of changes to the PCI’s procedures and practices; and

   •   Assessment and reporting of status changes to appropriate agency officials.

It is important to document proposed or actual changes to the overall operation of the PCI and to
determine the impact of those changes to its reliability. The PIV System will typically be in a
state of migration due to changes in technology and modifications to the surrounding
environment. Documenting PIV System and PCI changes and assessing their potential impact is
an essential aspect of monitoring and maintaining accreditation. The reliability of the
organization should also be evaluated by statistical sampling of the products and services of the
organization, and by direct observation of the day-to-day operations of the PCI for periods
selected on a random basis during certification.




                                               Page 21
5.0 PIV SERVICES AND OPERATIONS
The PCI attributes and methods of assessment described in chapter three should be used to assess
the capabilities of a PCI and the reliability of its services and operations.

5.1 Applicant Identity Proofing and Registration
FIPS 201 Sections 2.2 and 5.2 require the adoption and use of an approved identity proofing and
registration process. FIPS 201 Appendix A describes two models that satisfy the requisite PIV
control objectives and requirements and are approved for PIV Identity Proofing and Registration.

The Role Based Model defines the roles that must be played by various individuals or
organizations in order to prove the identity of an Applicant and then register the Applicant in the
PIV System and then authorize the Applicant to be issued a PIV Card. The roles in this model
are Applicant, PIV Sponsor, PIV Registrar, PIV Card Issuer, PIV Digital Signatory, and PIV
Authentication Certification Authority. The roles of Applicant, Sponsor, Registrar, and PCI
must be played by different people when issuing a PIV Card.

The System-Based Model uses slightly different terminology and processes to accomplish
equivalent results. The roles in this model are Applicant, Employer/Sponsor, Enrollment
Official, Approval Authority, Issuing Authority (PCI). This model calls for using best practices
and procedures for assuring separation of roles and performing responsibilities according to risk.
This model further stipulates that all roles and processes must be provided by accredited service
providers compliant with this standard. A PCI should be knowledgeable of the two approved
models, the differences between the roles defined in the models, and the requirement for
operating only an approved model to issue PIV Cards. A PCI needs to implement and support
only one approved model.

Applicant Interactions
Both identity proofing and registration approved models are designed to service PIV Card
Applicants by processing their identity source documents and obtaining authorization for issuing
a PIV Card to approved applicants in accordance with FIPS 201. A PCI must interact with the
applicant at various times under various circumstances. An Applicant should be notified
electronically or in writing of his/her responsibilities regarding identity proofing,
registration/enrollment, and issuance of a PIV Card. An Applicant should be notified all his/her
rights if a PIV Card is not approved. A PCI must be capable of assuring appropriate privacy to
the Applicant and his/her IIF, fairness and consistency in processing PIV Card Applications, and
protection of the Integrity and Confidentiality of information in the PIV System. The PCI should
exhibit the attributes of being knowledgeable, capable, accountable, available, trustworthy and
reliable in all dealings with an Applicant. These attributes should be assessed using document
review and analysis, interviews, direct observation, sampling, evaluation, and accepted practice.

Notification of Responsibilities and Rights
The Applicant should be notified of what information will be required to obtain a PIV Card,
what documents will be required in either original or paper copy form, what use will be made of
the Information in Identifiable Form (IIF), what protection it will be provided, what will be
required if the Application is approved, and what can be done by the Applicant if the Application

                                              Page 22
is denied. The Applicant should be notified of the responsibilities of holding a PIV Card and
notified of requirements to protect it in accordance with agency, PCI, and the PIV System’s
policies and rules. Such rules/agreements should include that the Applicant will not attempt to
clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card; will not assist others in gaining unauthorized
access to Federal facilities or information; and will report the loss or theft of an issued PIV Card
within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.

The Applicant should be notified of his/her rights under all applicable laws, rules, regulations,
directives, and policies. These include all privacy rights of the Applicant, including notification
how the IIF requested from the Applicant will be protected while stored or being processed, both
manually and electronically. The rights of the Applicant to reapply for the current position or for
other Federal or contractor positions if the Applicant is not accepted should be disclosed to the
Applicant. The procedures for correcting incorrect information in the Identity Source
Documents and all decisions based on them should be disclosed.

The PCI Manager should document how various outcomes of Identity Proofing will be handled
prior to the outcome arising and obtain agency approval for the planned responses to the
Applicant. To ensure protection of the rights of the Applicant as well as the security of the PIV
System, the PCI should exhibit the attributes of being knowledgeable, accountable, legal,
compliant, trustworthy, adequately supported, and secure. The most appropriate assessment
methods include review and analysis of documented plans and procedures; assessing the
knowledge of the PCI Manager and senior staff about laws, policies, human resource
management requirements, and Applicant legal rights and responsibilities; interviews of
Applicants (both successful and unsuccessful) selected using appropriate sampling and statistical
practices; comparison of the PCI under assessment with peer PCIs; and verification of
organizational adherence to established standards and SOPs. Interviews of Applicants and
Applicant Representatives selected by approved statistical sampling techniques and of Applicant
Representatives should be performed.

Application for a PIV Card
The following information should be solicited in a PIV Card application that is used by an
agency. Only items applicable to the Applicant and required by the agency for the position
should be used. They include Applicant’s full name; date and place of birth; Identity Source
Documents as required in FIPS 201; and other relevant information useful for proving the
claimed identity of the Applicant. PCIs should exhibit knowledge of the Identity Proofing
processing models and documentation requirements; legal rights of the Federal government and
the applicant; be available and responsive to the needs of an Applicant and the Applicant’s
sponsor/employer; be compliant with standards of good practice; be trustworthy in handling of
the Applicant’s IIF; and be adaptable and cooperative in responding to an agency’s needs. PCI
attribute assessment methods should include review and analysis of application forms; interviews
with sponsors, employers, registrars, Applicants, and Applicant Representatives; and comparison
of experience with peer PCI’s.

Authorization to Conduct Identity Proofing
The Applicant should be requested to authorize the PCI to process the Application in accordance
with the requirements of FIPS 201 and to conduct any and all Identity Proofing needed to verify
the authenticity of the Identity Source Documents and otherwise prove that the claimed Identity

                                               Page 23
is valid for the Applicant. The authorization should include the printed name and signature of
the PIV Card Applicant and the name of the PCI. The PCI must be knowledgeable and capable
of identity proofing, trustworthy in performing sensitive applicant interviews and background
reviews, available and accountable for performing the needed services, and cost effective in
providing a potentially time consuming and expensive procedure. The most appropriate
assessment methods should include review of documentation kept by PCI during the application
process; comparison with peers in obtaining identity proofing results rapidly and efficiently; and
testing of the procedures by submitting false claims of identity on a random basis.

Notification of Identity Proofing Results
The Applicant should be notified in writing of the results of Identity Proofing. The notification
should be originated by the PCI and submitted to the PIV Card Sponsor/Employer for
notification of the Applicant. The notification should include disclosure of additional rights of
the Applicant if the application is denied or instructions for proceeding to PIV Card Issuance if
the application is approved. The Applicant should be notified which PIV Applicant
Representative is available to assist in removing any incorrect information that adversely
affected the Identity Proofing process. The agency and PCI should have a written policy for
when and how often an Applicant may reapply if an Application is denied. Appropriate PCI
assessment methods include review of documentation of the application process and interviews
with a random sample of Applicants who have gone through the Identity Proofing and
registration/enrollment processes.

Agency Interactions5
A PCI should be explicitly authorized by an agency to issue PIV Cards for its employees, its
contractors, and other parties as defined in FIPS 201. One or more agencies may use the same
PCI and one agency may utilize more than one authorized PCI (see Figure 1). There will be
numerous interactions between an agency and its PCI(s).

The certification and accreditation processes specified in this document include initial and
periodic interactions between the agency DAA and the PCI Manager, often through a CA that is
an employee of the agency but not connected with the PCI. A primary goal of the PCI Manager
and the PCI’s personnel should be maintaining capable and available PIV Card Issuing services
in support of the agency, its employees and contract personnel to meet the reliability objective.
These attributes may be assessed through review and analysis of documented interactions, direct
observation of teams and committees established to optimize PIV Card adoption and utilization,
and interviews of agency officials and PCI Management.

Request for Identity Proofing
An agency PIV Employer/Sponsor issues a request for identity proofing to the PIV Registrar
who is responsible for identity proofing of the Applicant and ensuring successful completion of
the required background checks. The most appropriate PCI assessment method may be review of
documentation kept by the PCI during the application process.


5
    One or more agencies may use the same PIV Card Issuer. In this case, only one accreditation is needed but the PCI policy and
    accreditation package should be reviewed and approved by all agencies that use the PCI’s services.


                                                              Page 24
Enrollment/Registration of Applicant
Subsequent to satisfactory completion of Applicant Identity Proofing, the PIV Registrar registers
or enrolls the Applicant in the PIV System’s database and approves issuing of a PIV Card to the
Applicant. The most appropriate PCI assessment method may be review of documentation kept
by the PCI during the application process.

Notification of Identity Proofing Results
The PIV Registrar notifies the Applicant’s Employer/Sponsor that the identity proofing has been
completed and if the applicant has been approved. The Employer/Sponsor notifies the
Applicant. The most appropriate PCI assessment method may be review of documentation kept
by the PCI during the application process.

5.2 PIV Card Issuance
The PCI Manager is responsible for ensuring that PIV Cards are designed and produced in
accordance with the requirements in FIPS 201 and of the agencies using the PCI’s services.
During the design and production planning, the PCI must establish the responsibilities and
authorities for design and production. Inputs to establishing the complete set of Card
requirements include physical, electrical, functional, and interface requirements as specified in
FIPS 201; performance requirements as specified by the using agencies; and applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements as stated in HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 and those established by the
departments or agencies using the services, and overseeing the operations, of the PCI.
Specifications defined in these documents include secure and reliable forms of identification;
Identify Proofing; PIV Card Applicant privacy assurance; capture/acquisition and encoding of
biometrics; collecting, processing, and protecting personally identifiable information; and
maintaining a complete production record of PIV Cards from procurement of the blank cards
through issuance of a completed PIV Card. The most appropriate PCI assessment methods
include sampling and statistics of organizational adherence to established standards and standard
operating procedures (SOPs).

Design and development plans and specifications should be documented in a form that enables
verification against the design and operation requirements. The documents should provide
appropriate information for creating, establishing, or acquiring the needed facilities, automated
support equipment, operations staff, conformance tests, PCI System components, PIV Card
Readers/Writers, and other materials needed to operate a competent and reliable PCI and set of
services. The most appropriate PCI assessment methods include review and analysis of plans.

Periodic reviews of plans, processes and services should be performed in order to evaluate the
continued ability of the PCI to produce conformant and reliable PIV Cards and identify any
problems and propose corrective actions. Records of the results of the reviews and any necessary
actions shall be maintained and protected. The most appropriate PCI assessment methods include
review and analysis of plans.

Validation testing should be performed on the first PIV Cards produced by a PCI to ensure they
meet the stated requirements and periodically thereafter on a statistical sample of production
Cards to ensure that the production processes are operating properly. Initial validation shall be
performed prior to deeming that the PIV Card production process is operational. Records of the

                                              Page 25
results of validation and any necessary corrective actions must be maintained and made available
during subsequent certification phases. PCI assessment methods should include evaluation of
the results of validation testing, sampling of PIV components tested and passed by the validation
laboratory, and comparison with peers performing the testing services.

The PCI is responsible for ensuring that purchased, leased, or created PIV System services
comply with FIPS 201 specifications and that similarly acquired PIV Card stock, integrated
circuit chips, applications software, communications services and software, and biometric
marker (fingerprint and facial images) acquisition equipment conform to relevant standards’
requirements. The type and extent of control that should be applied to the supplier and the
purchased elements is dependent on the overall effect of the purchased items on the availability,
capability, and reliability of subsequently issued PIV Cards. The most appropriate PCI
assessment methods include review and analysis of supplier contracts, testing and validation of
the products, review and analysis of the experience of the supplier, accepted practice within the
PIV component industry, and conformance with standards required for the products.

The PCI should evaluate and select suppliers based on their ability to supply validated, FIPS 201
conformant Card components or related services in accordance with organizational and
regulatory requirements. Criteria for selection, evaluation and re-evaluation should be
established by the PCI Manager and documented for later assessment. The appropriate PCI
assessment methods include review and analysis of supplier contracts, experience, precedence or
accepted practices, sampling and testing.

Acquisition documentation should specify the requirements of Card components or related
services including requirements for delivery and acceptance; requirements for the supplier’s
procedures, processes and equipment in order to demonstrate reliability, requirements for
supplier’s personnel; protection of personally identifiable information of PIV Card Applicants if
applicable; and the overall organizational security posture of supplier. The PCI Manager or staff
should ensure that all procurement documents, actions, and controls satisfy the attributes of
compliant, legal, organized, and adequately supported. These attributes should be assessed using
the methods of review and analysis, direct observation, interviews, statistical sampling,
evaluation/measurement, compliance, conformance, and prior experience.

The PCI should exercise due diligence and care with an individual’s personally identifiable
information while it is under the Card issuer’s control or being used by the PCI in accordance
with regulations and organizational requirements. The PCI shall identify, verify, protect and
safeguard identity credentials and other personally identifiable information provided for use in
initializing or incorporation into the Card. If any individual’s personally identifiable information
is lost, damaged or found to be unsuitable for use, this should be reported to the individual and
the affected record should be changed. The PCI must have the capability and procedures for de-
enrolling employees, revoking and destroying Cards, and reissuing Cards, all in compliance with
FIPS 201. The most appropriate PCI assessment method may be review and analysis of plans and
sampling and statistics of organizational adherence to established standards and SOPs.

The PCI Manager is responsible for ensuring that the monitoring phase of the certification
and accreditation processes is undertaken and resources provided to collect and assess
relevant evidence of continued reliability of the PCI. The attributes that should be exhibited
include that the managers and operational personnel remain knowledgeable, capable, well

                                              Page 26
managed, available, and adequately supported throughout the life cycle of every issued PIV
Card. The PCI organization personnel should undergo assessment for continued organizational
reliability through review and analysis of required documentation, direct observation of day-to-
day operations, and continued compliance with standards.

Commitment of the PCI to the implementation and operation of a secure and reliable PIV System
can be demonstrated by documenting and communicating to the organization the importance of
meeting the requirements stated in HSPD-12, FIPS 201 and the FICC Identity Management
Handbook; conducting reviews and analysis of the PCI’s documentation; and ensuring the
availability of appropriate resources for the PCI. The PCI Manager should inform all managers
and operational personnel of this commitment and assure that all required policies, procedures,
and operational requirements are communicated throughout the organization.

5.3 PIV Card Life Cycle Management
The PCI Manager has the responsibility for reporting to agency management on the
performance of the PIV System and any need for improvement. The Manager is responsible for
reviewing the status of the PIV System on a periodic basis to ensure its continuing reliability.
The appropriate PCI assessment methods include review and analysis of reports and other
documentation.

PCI vital records should include PIV Applicant Enrollment/Registration performance, status of
recommended corrective actions, changes to the PCI’s operations that may affect the overall PIV
System, recommendations for improvements or modifications needed to adapt to changing
agency requirements, and changing resource needs along with a plan for acquiring the needed
resources. The appropriate PCI assessment methods include review and analysis of plans and
other records.

PCI personnel need to be reliable as determined by adherence to policies and standards
including FIPS 201 and HSPD-12, by appropriate interviews, and by passing background checks
and security clearances applicable to the position of the individual. The PCI’s Manager should
satisfy this requirement by determining the necessary education, experience, and areas of
competence needed by employees and contractors. The CA should assess if the management and
training of employees is being appropriately performed.

The PCI Manager must obtain and maintain the infrastructure needed to support performing the
services required of FIPS 201. Support infrastructure includes buildings, utilities, secure
transportation and storage of sensitive records and secure communications among system
components. The appropriate PCI assessment method is direct observation and demonstration of
the components, systems, and sub-systems. Comparison with peers and compliance with
accepted practice should be used to assess that the facility is adequately supported, well
managed, available when needed, secure and adaptable to change.


6.0 CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION
Certification and accreditation consists of four phases: (i) Initiation; (ii) Certification; (iii)
Accreditation; and (iv) Monitoring. Each phase consists of tasks and subtasks that are to be

                        Figure 5. Certification and Accreditation Processes

6.1 Initiation Phase
The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) resource identification; and (iii)
operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
DAA has identified the attributes of the PCI that should be exhibited before the certification
agent begins the assessment tasks. The early involvement of the DAA with key participants helps
assure the success of the certification and accreditation.

Task 1: Preparation
The objectives of this task are to prepare for certification and accreditation by reviewing the PCI
operations plan and confirming that the plan is consistent with FIPS 201 and the provided
services and operations comply with it.

Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the PCI system has been fully described and documented in the
               PCI‘s operations plan.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager
               Guidance: A PCI description includes— (i) the names of the agencies sponsoring
               and using the PCI; (ii) a unique identifier for the PCI; (iii) the status of the
               operations plan; (iv) the name of the DAA; (v) contact information for the PCI


                                                    Page 28
              Manager; (vi) the applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, and standards
              affecting the operations of the PCI; (vii) the PCI’s organization chart; (viii) a
              description of the automated system(s) used by the PCI in performing the required
              services; (ix) a description of the network used for communicating with
              information systems and the PIV System; (x) encryption algorithms and
              cryptographic key types and sizes used for protecting information processing,
              transmission, and storage; (xi) identification of public key infrastructures and
              certificate authorities; (xii) the physical environment in which the PCI and
              supporting automated systems operate; and (xiii) the distributed, collaborative
              computing environments comprising the PIV System.

Subtask 1.2: Confirm that the applicability of the PCI’s services and supporting automated
              system has been documented in the PCI’s plan and that it is not categorized as
              National Security.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: Consult NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-59, Guideline for
              Identifying an Information System as a National Security System, to confirm that
              the applicability of the PCI’s services are not related to National Security.

Subtask 1.3: Confirm that the PCI has adopted and will use approved identity proofing and
              registration processes as required in FIPS 201 and that all required roles,
              responsibilities, activities, and actions specified in the approved model (Role
              Based and System Based Models are pre-approved) are adequately documented in
              the PCI operations plan and are used for performing the required services.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: FIPS PUB 201, Sections 2.2 and 5.2, require the adoption and use an
              approved identity proofing and registration process. All identity proofing and
              registration systems must satisfy the PIV objectives and requirements stated in
              Sections 2.2 and 5.2 in order to be approved. Two models (Role Based and
              System Based) are approved in FIPS 201 as satisfying the requirements.
              Agencies presently using the System Based model may continue to use it for
              issuing PIV Cards. Agencies not having a current program based on the use of
              Integrated Circuit Cards for personal identity verification should design their PIV
              Card issuing service using the Role Based model.
Subtask 1.4: Confirm that the PCI has adopted and will use approved PIV Card Issuance and
              Life Cycle maintenance procedures.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: Section 2.3 of FIPS 201 requires the adoption and use of an approved
              PIV Card issuance and maintenance process. All PIV issuance and maintenance
              systems must satisfy the PIV-I objectives and requirements stated in Section 2.3
              in order to be approved. Two examples of PIV issuance process sets that satisfy
              the requisite PIV-II objectives and requirements are provided in Appendix A,
              Section A.1.2 and Appendix A Sections A.2.2 through A.2.4. The heads of
              Federal departments and agencies may approve other identity issuance process
              sets that are accredited as satisfying the requisite PIV-I objectives and

                                             Page 29
               requirements. Departments and agencies may enhance their issuance process to
               meet their local constraints and requirements.
Task 2: Resource Identification
The objectives of the resource identification task are to— (i) identify and document the resources
required for providing the services of FIPS 201 its specifications; and (ii) prepare a plan of
certification and accreditation activities indicating the proposed schedule and key milestones.

Subtask 2.1: Identify the DAA, AOP, CA(s), PIV Applicant representative(s), and other
               interested agency officials that are involved with agency personal identity
               verification, identity badge management, physical and information system access
               control, and information security that will be providing certification and
               accreditation support.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager
               Guidance: Identification of key agency officials is an important activity to
               establish that certification and accreditation processes are an integral part of the
               PCI system development life cycle and to verify that they will be participating in
               the processes. Identification and role assignments serve as a notification that the
               officials will be participants in the upcoming certification and accreditation tasks.

Subtask 2.2: Determine the resources required for the certification and accreditation of the PCI
               services and supporting automated system and prepare a plan of execution.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager; DAA
               Guidance: The level of effort required for certification depends on— (i) the size
               the PCI; (ii) its location and proximity to the agency personnel being served; (iii)
               the history and status of the PCI; and (iv) the specific methods and procedures
               used to assess the management and technical controls being used to determine the
               extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
               producing the desired outcome. Identifying appropriate resources (e.g., supporting
               organizations, funding, and individuals with critical skills) needed for the
               certification effort is essential and is typically integrated within development life
               cycle and capital planning and budgeting processes. Once a CA is selected (or
               certification services procured), an execution plan for conducting the certification
               and accreditation is prepared by the CA in conjunction with the PCI Manager and
               DAA. The execution plan contains specific tasks, milestones, and delivery
               schedule. This information can be included in a system development/change plan
               and need not be in a separate plan of execution.
Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are to— (i) perform an
analysis of the PCI attributes required and desired by the senior agency officials; (ii) obtain an
independent analysis of the PCI operations plan and revise as needed; and (iii) obtain acceptance
of the plan by the DAA prior to conducting an assessment of the attributes of the organization.




                                               Page 30
Subtask 3.1: Review the list of desired attributes of a PCI described in these guidelines and
              select those that should be exhibited by the PCI in addition to the required
              attributes in order to satisfy agency requirements.
              Responsibility: DAA; CA
              Guidance: HSPD-12 specified that the reliability of a PCI be officially accredited
              before it could issue PIV Cards. Reliability includes all required attributes. The
              attributes to be exhibited by an accredited PCI must be specified by the agency
              using a PCI’s services and then assessed to determine the extent to which the
              attributes are now being, or reasonably will be expected to be, exhibited.

Subtask 3.2 Select appropriate methods to assess the required and desired attributes of the
              PCI.
              Responsibility: CA
              Guidance: The CA(s) should review FIPS 201 and these guidelines to select
              methods and procedures for assessing the required and desired attributes of the
              PCI. The CA, as directed by the DAA, may supplement these assessment methods
              and procedures as desired by the agency using the services of the PCI.
              Assessment methods and procedures may need to be created or tailored for
              assessing additional attributes of, or services provided by, a PCI.

Subtask 3.3: Analyze the PCI operations plan to determine if there are vulnerabilities that
              would result in not satisfying all the policies, procedures, and other requirements
              in FIPS 201 and of the agency being serviced by the PCI if the plan was
              implemented properly and the specified operations performed as planned.
              Responsibility: DAA; CA
              Guidance: The PCI operations plan should specify the PIV Applicant vetting;
              identity source document proofing; and PIV Card creation, issuance, and life-
              cycle management services and procedures of the PCI. The independent analysis
              of the plan by the CA and review by the DAA determine if the plan is complete
              and consistent with the requirements of FIPS 201. The CA and DAA can then
              determine if potential risks vulnerabilities in the provided services and automated
              support system appear to be adequately assessed, countered, and that the residual
              risks are reasonable. Based on the results of the analysis by the CA and review by
              the DAA, changes to the operations plan should be recommended to the PCI
              Manager.

Subtask 3.4: Accept the PCI operations plan as acceptable.
              Responsibility: DAA
              Guidance: If the PCI operations plan and the residual risks are deemed
              acceptable, the DAA accepts the plan. Acceptance allows the certification and
              accreditation processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of the PCI plan
              also approves the resources required to initiate and complete the certification and
              accreditation activities.



                                             Page 31
6.2 Certification Phase
The Certification Phase consists of two tasks— (i) PCI attribute assessment; and (ii) certification
documentation. The purposes of this phase are to determine the extent to which the services and
specifications of FIPS 201 are provided and implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the requirements of the agency using the
services of the PCI. This phase also specifies actions to be taken to correct deficiencies in the
operations of the PCI and to minimize risks and mitigate vulnerabilities. Upon successful
completion of this phase, the DAA will have the information needed from the certification
activities to recommend the appropriate accreditation decision.

Task 4: PCI Services and Attribute Assessment
The objectives of this task are to— (i) initiate assessments of the required and desired attributes
of the PCI; (ii) conduct the assessments; and (iii) document the results of the assessments.
Initiation of attribute assessments involves gathering appropriate PIV policies, standards,
guidelines, service requirements, attribute evidence, and results from previous assessments or
audits. Initiation includes specifying the methods to be used to assess the attributes. The CA
should determine that the specified attributes of the PCI are exhibited in such a manner that any
Federal agency will accept the personal identity verification procedures performed by, and PIV
Cards produced, by the PCI. The CA should also be in a position to make recommendations on
corrective actions for discovered deficiencies and offer advice to the PCI Manager and DAA on
how to proceed with the certification.

Subtask 4.1: Assemble all documentation and supporting materials necessary for the
               assessment of the PCI; if these documents include previous assessments, then
               review the findings, results, and evidence.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager; CA
               Guidance: The PCI Manager should assist the CA in gathering all relevant
               documents and supporting materials from the agency that will be required during
               the assessment of the required and desired attributes of the PCI. Supporting
               materials include PCI policies, the approved PCI service description and
               operations plan, relevant standards, guidelines, identity management handbooks,
               documentation available from other previously accredited PCIs, and any records
               showing evidence of the required and desired attributes of the PCI. Assessment
               results from validation programs that test and evaluate features of commercial
               PIV components and products are especially important. If assessment results of
               similar PCI support systems are available, the CA may incorporate those results
               into the certification. CAs should maximize the use of previous assessment results
               whenever feasible.

Subtask 4.2: Assess the required and desired attributes of the PCI using methods and
               procedures selected or developed.
               Responsibility: CA
               Guidance: Assessment should determine the extent to which the attributes are
               inherent in, or exhibited by, the PCI. The results of the assessments, including


                                               Page 32
              recommendations for correcting any deficiencies in the attributes of the PCI, PIV
              Card services offered, or procedures used should be documented in the
              assessment report.

Subtask 4.3: Prepare the assessment report.
              Responsibility: CA
              Guidance: The assessment report contains— (i) the results of assessments; and
              (ii) recommendations for correcting deficiencies in the organization, its services,
              its procedures, and its results. The assessment report is part of the final
              accreditation package along with the revised PCI operations plan and corrective
              actions plan (CAP). The assessment report is the CA’s statement regarding the
              capabilities and reliability, among other required and desirable attributes, of the
              PCI.
Task 5: Certification Documentation
The security certification documentation task— (i) provides the certification findings and
recommendations to the PCI Manager; (ii) recommends revision of the PCI’s plan as needed;
(iii) prepares the CAP (including milestones); and (iv) assembles the accreditation package. The
PCI Manager has an opportunity to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the PCI operations plan
prior to the assembly of the accreditation package and submission to the DAA. This is
accomplished by implementing corrective actions recommended by the CA. The CA should
assess service modifications or enhancements added during this process.

Subtask 5.1: Provide the PCI Manager with the certification report.
              Responsibility: CA
              Guidance: The PCI Manager relies on the expertise, experience and judgment of
              the CA to— (i) assess the required and desired attributes exhibited by the PCI;
              and (ii) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the planned or
              performed operations. The PCI Manager may choose to act on selected
              recommendations of the CA before the accreditation package is finalized. To
              optimize utilization of resources agency-wide, any actions taken by the PCI
              Manager prior to the final accreditation decision should be coordinated with the
              DAA. The CA assesses any changes made in response to the corrective actions
              and revises the assessment report as appropriate.

Subtask 5.2: Revise the PCI operations plan.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: The PCI operations plan should reflect changes made in response to
              recommendations for corrective actions from the CA. At the completion of the
              Certification Phase, the plan should accurately describe what PIV services are to
              be offered, how they will be performed, how all the managerial and technical
              requirements specified in FIPS 201 shall be satisfied, how the required services
              are to be offered and to whom, and how the attributes of the PCI considered to be
              required or desirable will be continued throughout the life cycle of the
              organization.


                                              Page 33
Subtask 5.3: Prepare the CAP.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager
               Guidance: The CAP, one of the three primary documents in the accreditation
               package, describes actions to be taken by the PCI Manager to correct deficiencies
               identified in the Certification phase. The CAP identifies— (i) the tasks to be
               accomplished; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; and (iii)
               scheduled completion dates for the tasks.

Subtask 5.4: Assemble the accreditation package and submit to DAA.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager; CA
               Guidance: The PCI Manager is responsible for the assembly and compilation of
               the accreditation package with inputs from the CA. The accreditation package
               contains— (i) the assessment report from the CA providing the results of the
               assessment of the attributes of the PCI and recommendations for corrective
               actions if needed; (ii) the CAP from the PCI Manager; and (iii) the revised PCI
               operations plan. Certification agent input to the accreditation package provides an
               independent assessment of the capabilities and reliability, along with the other
               required and desired attributes, of the PCI in fulfilling all FIPS 201 requirements.
               The PCI Manager may also wish to consult with other key agency participants
               (e.g., the AOP and the PIV Applicant’s representatives) prior to submitting the
               final accreditation package to the DAA. The DAA should use this information
               during the Accreditation Phase to determine if the PCI procedures, operations,
               and reliability should be accredited and that the PCI should be authorized to
               operate. The accreditation package can be submitted in either paper or electronic
               form. The contents of the accreditation package should be protected appropriately
               in accordance with agency policy.

6.3 Accreditation Phase
The Accreditation Phase consists of two tasks— (i) making an appropriate accreditation
decision; and (ii) completing the accreditation documentation. Upon successful completion of
this phase, the PCI Manager will have— (i) an authorization to operate the PCI services defined
in its operations plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms (e.g., three (3)
months) and conditions; or (iii) a denial of authorization.

Task 6: Accreditation Decision
The accreditation decision task determines if the certification phase has resulted in a
recommendation to authorize operation of the PCI in accordance with the operations plan. The
DAA, working with the CA and the assessments produced during the previous phase, reviews the
identified vulnerabilities and the CAP to reduce or eliminate those vulnerabilities. This
information is used to determine the final risk to the agency and the acceptability of that risk.

Subtask 6.1: Determine the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on
               the PCI’s vulnerabilities and the CAP and perform a final certification review.
               Responsibility: DAA


                                                Page 34
              Guidance: The DAA receives the final accreditation package from the PCI
              Manager or the CA. The vulnerabilities in the PCI should be assessed by the CA
              to determine how those particular vulnerabilities translate into risk to agency
              operations, agency assets, or individuals. The DAA should judge which PCI
              vulnerabilities are of greatest concern to the agency and which vulnerabilities can
              be tolerated without creating unreasonable agency-level risk. The CAP should
              also be considered in determining the risk to the agency. The DAA may consult
              the PCI manager, CA, or other agency officials before making the final risk
              determination.

Subtask 6.2: Determine if the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is
              acceptable, that the required and desired attributes are exhibited as needed, that
              the reliability of the PCI has been adequately assessed, and prepare the final
              accreditation decision letter.
              Responsibility: DAA
              Guidance: The DAA should consider many factors when deciding if the risk to
              agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is acceptable. Balancing risk
              considerations with mission and operational needs is paramount to achieving an
              acceptable accreditation decision. The DAA renders an accreditation decision
              after reviewing all of the relevant information and, where appropriate, consulting
              with key agency officials.
              If, after assessing the results of the certification, the DAA deems that the agency-
              level risk is acceptable, an authorization to operate is issued. The PCI is
              accredited without any restrictions or limitations on its operation.
              If, after assessing the results of certification, the DAA deems that the agency-level
              risk is unacceptable, but there is an important mission-related need to place the
              PCI into operation, an interim authorization to operate may be issued. The interim
              authorization to operate is a limited authorization under specific terms and
              conditions (e.g., a three (3) month duration) including corrective actions to be
              taken by the PCI Manager and a required timeframe (e.g., two (2) months) for
              completion of those actions. A detailed CAP should be submitted by the PCI
              Manager and CA and approved by the DAA prior to the interim authorization to
              operate taking effect. The PCI is not accredited during this period. The PCI
              Manager is responsible for completing the corrective actions identified in the
              CAP and resubmitting an updated accreditation package upon completion of those
              actions.
              If, after assessing the results of the certification, the DAA deems that the agency-
              level risk is unacceptable, the PCI is not authorized for operation and not
              accredited.
              The DAA’s administrative staff prepares the final accreditation decision letter.
              The letter includes the accreditation decision, the rationale for the decision, the
              terms and conditions for the PCI’s operation, and required corrective actions, if
              appropriate. The accreditation decision letter states whether the system is— (i)
              authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis under strict
              terms and conditions; or (iii) not authorized to operate. The supporting rationale

                                             Page 35
               provides the rationale for the DAA’s decision. The terms and conditions for the
               authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions that must be
               followed. The accreditation letter is included in the final accreditation package.
               The contents of the accreditation package should be protected appropriately in
               accordance with agency policy.
Task 7: Accreditation Documentation
The objective of the accreditation documentation task is to— (i) transmit the final accreditation
package to the appropriate individuals and organizations; and (ii) update the PCI’s operations
plan.

Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the final accreditation package including the accreditation
               decision letter, in either paper or electronic form, to the PCI Manager and any
               other agency officials having interests, roles, or responsibilities in the PIV
               System. A copy of the submittal letter and the selected authorization letter should
               be forwarded electronically to PIVaccreditation@nist.gov when they are delivered
               to the intended recipient.
               Responsibility: DAA
               Guidance: The accreditation package including the accreditation decision letter is
               transmitted to the PCI manager. Upon receipt of the accreditation decision letter
               and accreditation package, the PCI manager reviews the terms and conditions of
               the authorization. The original accreditation package is kept on file by the PCI
               manager. The DAA retains copies of the decision letter and accreditation package.
               The accreditation package should be appropriately safeguarded and stored,
               whenever possible, in a centralized agency filing system to ensure accessibility.
               The accreditation package should be readily available to auditors and oversight
               agencies upon request. The accreditation package should be retained in
               accordance with the agency’s records retention policy.

Subtask 7.2: Update the PCI’s operations plan.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager
               Guidance: The operations plan should be updated to reflect any changes made as
               the result of the C&A processes. Any conditions set forth in the accreditation
               decision should also be noted in the plan. Any PIV Card issued by a PCI (i)
               between accreditation and the loss of accreditation; and/or (ii) during a three-
               month period of operation with an interim authorization should be encoded in the
               PIV system with an appropriate warning to any agency making an access control
               decision based on the PIV Card.

6.4 Monitoring Phase
The Monitoring Phase consists of three tasks— (i) PCI management and control; (ii) PCI status
monitoring; and (iii) status reporting and documentation. The purposes of this phase are to
provide oversight and monitoring of the day-to-day operations of the PCI on an ongoing basis
and to inform the DAA when changes occur that may impact the reliability of the PIV System or
any of its components. The activities in this phase are performed continually throughout the life

                                              Page 36
cycle of the PIV System. Re-accreditation may be required because of changes in operation,
management, technology, or support systems or because agency policies require periodic re-
accreditation or independent accreditation of the PIV system or its components. No more than
three (3) years should pass between PCI reliability accreditations.

Task 8: PCI Management and Control
The objectives of the PCI management and control task are to— (i) document proposed or actual
changes to the PCI and its operations plan; and (ii) determine the impact of proposed or actual
changes on the services, operations, and reliability of the PCI. Any organization or automated
system will undergo changes in personnel, facilities, environments, hardware, software, or
firmware. Documenting changes and assessing their potential impacts on an ongoing basis is an
essential aspect of maintaining accreditation.

Subtask 8.1: Using established management and control procedures, document any changes
              that may be significant with respect to service offerings, PIV Card operations, or
              the PIV support automated system (including hardware, software, firmware, and
              surrounding environment).
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: An orderly and disciplined approach to managing, controlling, and
              documenting changes to PCI policies, procedures, services, and support systems
              is critical to the assessment of the PIV Card life cycle management of the PCI. It
              is important to record all relevant information about changes to procedures,
              hardware, firmware, or software and modified features or capabilities. It is also
              important to record any changes to the working environment such as
              modifications to the physical facilities, management, and key personnel. The PCI
              Manager should use this documentation in assessing the potential impact of
              changes to the required and desired attributes of the PCI. Significant changes
              should not be undertaken without assessing impact of such changes.
Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the PCI (including hardware, software,
              firmware, and surrounding environment) services and operations and analyze
              them to determine the impact of such changes.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: Changes in the PIV System may affect the operations of the PCI,
              produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate requirements for new
              procedures. If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the PCI
              could affect the PCI’s operations, corrective actions should be initiated and the
              CAP updated. The DAA or the PCI Manager should consult with potentially
              affected agency officials prior to making the changes.
Task 9: PCI Status Monitoring
The objectives of the monitoring task are to— (i) select an appropriate set of attributes to be
monitored; and (ii) assess the selected attributes using methods and procedures selected by the
PCI Manager. The monitoring phase helps to identify potential problems during operations that
are not identified during the certification phase.



                                             Page 37
Subtask 9.1: Select the attributes of the PCI to be monitored.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager
               Guidance: The attributes of the PCI established by the PCI Manager to be
               monitored should reflect the agency’s priorities and importance of the PIV
               services to the agency. For example, certain attributes may be considered more
               critical than others because of the potential impact on the operations if those
               attributes were reduced or circumvented. The attributes being monitored should
               be reviewed over time to ensure that a representative sample is included in the
               ongoing assessments. The DAA and PCI Manager should agree on the attributes
               that should be monitored as well as the frequency of such monitoring activity. The
               level of effort applied to the assessment should be commensurate with the
               sensitivity of the assets being protected by PIV Cards, and the risks remaining in
               the PCI (i.e., the level of effort should be increased corresponding to increases in
               the potential impact on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals
               increases).
Subtask 9.2: Assess the required and selected desired attributes to determine the extent to
               which they are exhibited by the PCI in all aspects of providing services to the
               agency and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
               requirements specified in FIPS 201.
               Responsibility: DAA, PCI Manager
               Guidance: The assessing of the attributes of an organization can be accomplished
               in a variety of ways. The methods and procedures employed to assess the PCI’s
               attributes during the monitoring process are at the discretion of the DAA
               coordinating with the PCI Manager. The monitoring process should be
               documented and available for review by the DAA, an external auditor, or
               accreditation organization (if applicable) upon request. If the results of the
               attribute assessment indicate that processes are less than effective and are
               affecting reliability of the operations of the PCI, corrective actions should be
               initiated and the CAP updated.
Task 10: Status Reporting and Documentation
Status reporting and documentation includes— (i) updating the PCI’s operations plan to reflect
changes that could affect the reliability of the PCI and; (ii) updating the CAP based on the results
of assessments conducted during the monitoring phase; and (iii) reporting the status of the PCI’s
reliability critical and desirable attributes and experiences (problems and successes) to the DAA.
The information in the status reports should be used as part of the determination of the need for
re-accreditation and to satisfy agency policy and specified requirements (e.g., re-accreditation
should be performed at least every three (3) years).

Subtask 10.1: Update the PCI’s operations plan based on documented changes to the PCI’s
               operational requirements, personnel, facilities, equipment, and technology
               available to implement PIV systems and components and the results of the
               monitoring process.
               Responsibility: PCI Manager



                                               Page 38
              Guidance: The PCI’s operations plan should contain the most up-to-date
              information about the services being offered, the technology being used, the
              statistics on false acceptance and false rejection rates of the Cards it issues, and
              the changes being planned. The frequency of plan updates is at the discretion of
              the PCI Manager. The updates should occur at appropriate intervals to capture
              significant changes to the operations, but not so frequently as to generate
              unnecessary work. The DAA, PCI Manager and CA should use the plan to guide
              future certification and accreditation activities.
Subtask 10.2: Update the CAP based on the documented changes to the operations plan and the
              results of the monitoring process.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: The CAP is used by the DAA to monitor progress in correcting
              deficiencies noted during certification. The CAP should— (i) report progress in
              correcting deficiencies noted in the operations plan; (ii) address vulnerabilities in
              the PCI discovered during monitoring; and (iii) describe how the deficiencies will
              be corrected and the vulnerabilities eliminated or minimized.
Subtask 10.3: Report the status of the PCI to the DAA.
              Responsibility: PCI Manager
              Guidance: The status report should describe the PCI monitoring activities and
              report the results of monitoring. The status report should include descriptions of
              changes to the PCI’s services, management, key personnel, PIV Card issuing
              support automated systems, and deficiencies. The frequency of status reports
              should be responsive to the detected risks in the operations of the PCI and re-
              accreditation should be initiated as necessary. The status report should be handled
              and protected in accordance with agency policy.

Terminology as
used in this document      Definition or explanation of term

CAP                        Corrective Action Plan of a PCI for removing or reducing
                           deficiencies or risks during PCI operations.

Certification              Certification in this context means a formal process of assessing the
(as applied to a PCI)      attributes (e.g., knowledge, availability, accountability, trustworthy,
                           security) of a PCI using various methods of assessment (e.g.,
                           interviews, document reviews, test results, evaluations, validation
                           reports) that support the assertion that a PCI is reliable and capable
                           of identity proofing and enrolling approved applicants and issuing
                           PIV Cards in accordance with FIPS 201.

Certification Agent (CA)   The individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting
                           certification activities under the guidance and direction of a

                              services (e.g., identity proofing and registration, issuing PIV
                              Cards).

Identification                The process of discovering the true identity (i.e., origin, initial
                              history) of a person or item from the entire collection of similar
                              persons or items.

Identifier                    Unique data used to represent a person’s identity and associated
                              attributes. A name or a card number are examples of identifiers.

Identity                      The set of physical and behavioral characteristics by which an
                              individual is uniquely recognizable.

Identity Proofing             The process of providing sufficient information (e.g., identity
                              history, credentials, documents) to a PIV Registrar when attempting
                              to establish an identity.

Identity Registration         The process of making a person’s identity known to the PIV
                              system, associating a unique identifier with that identity, and
                              collecting and recording the person’s relevant attributes into the
                              system.

Identity Verification         The process of confirming or denying that a claimed identity is
                              correct by comparing the credentials (something you know,
                              something you have, something you are) of a person requesting
                              access with those previously proven and stored in the PIV Card or
                              system and associated with the identity being claimed.

Subject: PCI Accreditation Package for [PCI]


A certification of the [PCI NAME] located at [LOCATION] has been conducted in accordance with
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-79, Guidelines for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV
Card Issuing Organizations and the [AGENCY] policy on PCI accreditation. The attached
accreditation package contains— (i) the PCI operations plan; (ii) the assessment report; and (iii)
a corrective action plan (CAP).

The PCI operations plan, its procedures, and its attributes have been assessed by [CERTIFICATION
AGENT] using the assessment methods and procedures defined in SP 800-79 and specified in the
assessment report to determine the extent to which the required and desired attributes of a
capable and reliable PCI are exhibited and if the PIV Card issuing procedures are operating as
intended and producing the desired results. The CAP describes the corrective actions that we
plan to perform to remove or reduce any remaining deficiencies detected in the PCI’s procedures
and attributes.

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI MANAGER]


After reviewing the results of the certification and accreditation package of the [PCI] and its
supporting automated PIV system support components located at [LOCATION] and the evidence
provided in the associated accreditation package, I have determined that the PCI’s plan and
procedures and capabilities are in compliance with FIPS 201 and our privacy and security
policies and are acceptable. Accordingly, I am issuing an authorization to operate (ATO) the
PCI’s services in its existing or specified operating environment. The PCI is accredited without
any significant restrictions or limitations. This accreditation is my formal declaration that
adequate attributes are being exhibited by the PCI, that a satisfactory level of capability and
reliability is present, and that the PCI is expected to this maintain this capability, reliability, and
operational status for at least the next three years or until a major change is made to its operation.

This accreditation and ATO will remain in effect as long as— (i) the required monitoring is
performed and status reports for the PCI are submitted to this office every [TIME PERIOD – ONE
YEAR IS RECOMMENDED]; (ii) the problems detected during the monitoring process do not result
in agency-level risks that are unacceptable; and (iii) the capability and reliability of the PCI is
re-accredited within the lesser time of three (3) years or the re-accreditation requirements
established by agency policy.

A copy of this letter with all supporting certification and accreditation documentation should be
retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.

From: Designated Accreditation Authority                                    Date:

To: PCI Manager

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI]

After reviewing the results of the certification of the [PCI] and its supporting automated PIV
system support components located at [LOCATION] and the evidence provided in the associated
accreditation package, I have determined that the required attributes exhibited by the [PCI] are
not acceptable. However, I have determined that there is an overarching need for the PCI to
provide the needed services due to mission necessity and other considerations. Accordingly, I am
issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO) the PCI services in its existing operating
environment. Operation of the PCI must be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and
conditions during the IATO period and all detected risks of operation and problems encountered
during operation should be documented. The PCI is not considered accredited during the IATO
period.

Reliability of the PCI operations and security of the PCI’s automated support systems must be
monitored rigorously during the IOTA period. Monitoring activities should focus on the specific
areas of concern identified during the certification assessments. Significant changes in the status
of the operations during the IOTA period should be reported immediately. All PIV Cards issued
by the PCI during this period should be marked in the PIV System so that agencies accepting the
Cards for access control decisions are aware they were issued by the PCI during an IOTA period.
Once accreditation is obtained by the PCI, these Cards should be examined and the marking
removed for the Cards that are determined to meet the requirements of the accredited PCI.

This interim authorization to operate is valid for a maximum of three (3) months. The limited
authorization will remain in effect as long as— (i) the required status reports for the system are
submitted to this office every month; (ii) the problems or deficiencies reported during the
monitoring process do not result in additional risk which is deemed unacceptable; and (iii)
continued progress is being made in reducing or eliminating the deficiencies in accordance with
the CAP. At the end of the IOTA period, the PCI must either be certified and accredited and
authorized to operate or the authorization for further operation will be denied. A second IOTA
will be granted only under extenuating circumstances. This office will review the CAP submitted
with the accreditation package during the IOTA period and monitor progress on removal or
reduction of concerns and discrepancies before re-accreditation is initiated.

A copy of this letter and all supporting certification and accreditation documentation should be
retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.

To: PCI Manager

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI Manager]

After reviewing the results of the certification of the [PCI] located at [LOCATION] and the
supporting evidence provided in the associated accreditation package, I have determined that the
attributes exhibited by the PCI are unacceptable. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of
authorization to operate (DATO) the PCI in its planned or existing operating environment. The
PCI is not accredited and [MAY NOT BE PLACED INTO OPERATION or ALL CURRENT OPERATIONS
MUST BE HALTED].

The Corrective Action Plan (CAP) should be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Re-certification and
re-accreditation should be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of
correcting the deficiencies.

A copy of this letter with all supporting certification and accreditation documentation should be
retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention schedule.
