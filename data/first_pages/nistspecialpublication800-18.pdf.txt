rhe         National Institute of Standards and Technology was established in 1988 by Congress to "assist industry in
         the development of technology             .   needed to improve product quality, to modernize manufacturing processes,
                                                       .   .



to ensure product reliability     .   .   .   and to facilitate rapid commercialization ... of products based on new scientific
discoveries."
       NIST, originally founded as the National Bureau of Standards in 1901, works to strengthen U.S. industry's
competitiveness; advance science and engineering; and improve public health, safety, and the environment. One
of the agency's basic functions is to develop, maintain, and retain custody of the national standards of
measurement, and provide the means and methods for comparing standards used in science, engineering,
manufacturing, commerce, industry, and education with the standards adopted or recognized by the Federal
Government.
       As an agency of die U.S. Commerce Department's Technology Administration, NIST conducts basic and
applied research in the physical sciences and engineering, and develops measurement techniques, test
methods, standards, and related services. The Institute does generic and precompetitive work on new and
advanced technologies. NIST's research facilities are located at Gaithersburg,                  MD 20899, and at Boulder, CO 80303.
Major technical operating units and their principal activities are listed below. For more information contact the

                                   Executive Summary

The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information
technology (IT) resources. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require
protection as part of good management practice. The protection of a system must be
documented in a system security plan. The completion of system security plans is a
requirement of the Office of Management and Budget (0MB) Circular A- 130,
"Management of Federal hiformation Resources," Appendix III, "Security of Federal
Automated Information Resources," and Public Law 100-235, "Computer Security Act of
1987."


The purpose of the security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of
the system and describe the controls in place or plarmed for meeting those requirements.
The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all
individuals who access the system. The security plan should be viewed as documentation
of the structured process of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a
system. It should reflect input from various managers with responsibilities concerning
the system, including information owners, the system operator, and the system security
manager. Additional information may be included in the basic plan and the structure and
format organized according to agency needs, so long as the major sections described in
this document are adequately covered and readily identifiable.



In order for the plans to adequately reflect the protection of the resources, a management
official must authorize a system to process information or operate.   The authorization of a
system to process information, granted by a management official, provides an important
quality control.   By authorizing processing in a system, the manager accepts its
associated risk.


Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management,
operational, and technical controls. Since the security plan establishes and documents the
security controls, it should form the basis for the authorization, supplemented by more
specific studies as needed. In addition, a periodic review of controls should also
contribute to fiiture authorizations. Re-authorization should occur prior to a significant
change in processing, but at least every three years. It should be done more often where
there is a high risk and potential magnitude of harm.

1      Introduction

Today's rapidly changing technical environment requires federal agencies to adopt a
minimum set of management controls to protect their information technology (IT)
resources. These management controls are directed at individual information technology
users in order to reflect the distributed nature of today's technology. Technical and
operational controls support management controls. To be effective, these controls all
must interrelate. This document provides a guideline for federal agencies to follow when
developing the security plans that document the management, technical, and operational
controls for federal automated information systems.




 1.1    Background

The completion of system security plans is a requirement of the Office of Management
and Budget (0MB) Circular A- 130, "Management of Federal Information Resources,"
Appendix EI, "Security of Federal Automated hiformation Resources," updated in 1996,
and of Public Law 100-235, "Computer Security Act of 1987."

0MB Circular A- 130, Appendix     III, does not distinguishbetween sensitive and non-
sensitive systems. Rather, consistent with the Computer Security Act of 1987, the
Circular recognizes that federal automated information systems have varied sensitivity
and criticality. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require protection
as part of good management practice. The generic term "system" is used in this
document to mean either a major application or a general support system.


                                                                                      *


 1.2    Major Application or General Support System Plans

All applications and systems must be covered by system security plans if they are
categorized as a "major application" or "general support system." Specific security
plans for other applications are not required because the security controls for those
applications or systems would be provided by the general support systems in which they
operate. For example, a department-wide Financial Management System would be a
major application requiring its own security plan. A local program designed to track
expenditures against an office budget might not be considered a major application and
would be covered by a general support system security plan for an office automation
system or a local area network (LAN). Standard commercial off-the-shelf software (such
as word processing software, electronic mail software, utility software, or other general-
purpose software) would not typically be considered a major application and would be
covered by the plans for the general support system on which they are installed.

                                                                    Guide for Developing Security

    1.3   Relationship to Other NIST Security Documents

This document completes the NIST trilogy of IT security program-level guidance. The
planning guide is intended to be a companion to NIST Special Publication 800-12, An
Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook (Handbook) and NIST Special
Publication 800-14, Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing
Information Technology Systems (Principles and Practices). The NIST Handbook
contains over 200 pages of guidance in securing computer-based resources.        The
document explains important concepts, cost considerations, and interrelationships of
security controls. It provides a broad overview of computer security and provides the
"why" to many security-related issues. The Handbook served as the template for
deriving the practices recommended in the NIST Special Publication 800-14, Generally
Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems.

The Principles and Practices document provides the "what" should be done in securing
IT resources. The principles section contains the intrinsic expectations that must be met
whether the system is small, large or owned by a government agency or by a private
corporation. The practices section is the next level in the foundation of the document. The
practices show what should be done to enhance or measure an existing computer security
program or to aid in the development of a new program.

This planning guide builds on the practices portion in this document, most practices are
further expanded and in some cases, excerpts are provided for clarity. The NIST
Handbook and the Principles and Practices documents should be referenced for further
information. The NIST Handbook should be used to obtain additional detail or
explanation on any of the controls listed. The Principles and Practices document should
be used as a reference to describe the controls and used as a guide for reviewing the plan.
Each planning guide control chapter easily maps to the NIST Handbook and the
Principles and Practices document since the chapters in all three documents are listed
under the same three controls, i.e., management, operational, and technical.


The NIST Handbook and the Principles and Practices documents can be obtained from
the NIST Computer Security Resource Clearinghouse Web site at the URL:

    1.4   Purposes of Security Plans

The purposes of system security plans are to:

•     Provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the
      controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements; and


•     Delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access the
      system.

                                                                      Use for All Systems
                                                                              Guide for Developing Security
                                                                  Plans for Information Technology Systems




 1.5    Security Plan Responsibilities

The System Owner' is responsible for ensuring that the security plan is prepared and for
implementing the plan and monitoring its effectiveness. Security plans should reflect
input from various individuals with responsibilities concerning the system, including
functional "end users," Information Owners,^ the System Administrator, and the System
Security Manager.


Agencies may require contractor compliance with this guide as a contract requirement.                      A
security plan in the format specified in this document or in another agreed upon format is
suggested in those cases where vendors are operating a system under contract to the
federal government. In those instances where a contractor or other entity (e.g., state or
local government) operates a system that supports a federal function, a security plan is
required.


0MB Circular A- 130 requires a summary of the security plan to be incorporated into the
strategic   IRM plan required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).

Agencies should develop policy on the security planning process. Security plans are
living documents that require periodic reviews, modifications, and milestone or
completion dates for planned controls. Procedures should be in place outlining who
reviews the plans and follows up on planned controls. In addition, procedures are needed
describing how security plans will be used in the authorization for processing process.




 1.6    Recommended Format

While the format in this guide is recommended, it is recognized that some agencies have
developed plans using other formats that meet the A- 130 requirements described in this
document. This document is intended as guidance only and should not be construed as
the only format allowed.    A standardized approach, however, not only makes the
development of the plan easier by providing examples, but also provides a baseline to
review plans. The level of detail included within the plan should be consistent with the
criticality and value of the system to the organization's mission (i.e., a more detailed plan

is required for systems critical        to the organization's mission).    The security plan should
fiilly identify and describe the controls currently in place or planned for the system and

should include a list of rules of behavior.




          The System Owner is responsible for defming the system's operating parameters, authorized
functions, and security requirements.  The information owner for information stored within, processed by,
or transmitted by a system may or may not be the same as the System Owner. Also, a single system may
utilize information from multiple Information Owners.
 ^
          The Information Owner is responsible for establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection
of the subject data/information (rules of behavior). The Information Ovmer retains that responsibility even
when the data/information are shared with other organizations.

                                                                                Use for All Systems
                                                                       Guide for Developing Security
                                                            Plans for Information Technology Systems



 1.7   Advice and Comment on Plan

Independent advice and comment on the security plan shall be solicited prior to the plan's
implementation. Independent advice and comment must be obtained from individuals
within or outside the organization, who are not responsible for the system's development,
implementation, or operation. Organizational policy should define who will provide the
independent advice. Individuals providing advice and comment should be independent of
the system owner's reporting chain and should have adequate knowledge or experience to
ensure the plan contains appropriate information and meets organizational security policy
and standards. Appropriate individuals might include an organization's IT Security
Program Manager, IT managers of other systems, outside contractors, or personnel fi^om
another federal organization.




 1.8   Audience

This guide has two distinct uses.   It is to   be used by those individuals responsible for IT
security at the system level and at the organization level.     The document is intended as a
guide when creating security plans. It is written specifically for individuals with little or
no computer security expertise. The document also can be used as an auditing tool by
auditors, managers, and IT security officers. The concepts presented are generic and can
be applied to organizations in private and public sectors.



 1.9   Organization of Document

Chapter 1 introduces the document and explains its relationship to other NIST guidance
on IT security. Chapter 2 describes the system analysis process. Chapter 3 provides
guidance on the general information contained in all security plans. Chapter 4 presents
the management controls that should be considered. Chapter 5 describes the operational
controls and Chapter 6 presents the technical controls. Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 have
been split into two formats: one format for major applications and another format for
general support systems. Differences between the operational and technical controls of
major applications and general support systems warrant separate sections. The formats
are depicted by 5. MA  and 6. MA for major applications and 5.GSS and 6.GSS for general
support systems. Appendix A provides an example of Rules of Behavior for a major
application. Appendix B provides an example of Rules of Behavior for a general support
system. To assist the reader in preparing the plan with the appropriate format, Appendix
C contains two security plan templates, one for major applications and one for general
support systems. Appendix D contains a glossary of terms.         The terms found in the
glossary are highlighted in this document the first time used. Appendix E lists references
that may be useful in preparing security plans and finally, an Index is provided for
locating specific topics.

2      System Analysis

Once completed, a security plan will contain technical information about the system, its
security requirements, and the controls implemented to provide protection against its
risks and vulnerabilities. Before the plan can be developed, a determination must be
made as to which type of plan is required for a system. This section walks the reader
through an analysis of the system to determine the boundaries of the system and the type
of system.



 2.1    System Boundaries

Defining what constitutes a "system" for the purposes of this guideline requires an
analysis of system boundaries and organizational responsibilities.   A system, as defined
by this guideline, is identified by constructing logical boundaries around a set of
processes, communications, storage, and related resources. The elements within these
boundaries constitute a single system requiring a security plan. Each element of the
system must:


•   Be under the same direct management control;

•   Have the same function or mission objective;

•   Have essentially the same operating characteristics and security needs; and

•   Reside in the same general operating environment.


All components of a system need not be physically connected (e.g., [1] a group of stand-
alone personal computers (PCs) in an office; [2] a group of PCs placed in employees'
homes under defined telecommuting program rules; [3] a group of portable PCs provided
to employees who require mobile computing capability for their jobs; and [4] a system
with multiple identical configurations that are installed in locations with the same
environmental and physical safeguards).



2.2     Multiple Similar Systems

An organization may have systems that differ only in the responsible organization or the
physical environment in which they are located (e.g., air traffic control systems). In such
instances, it is appropriate and recommended to use plans that are identical except for
those areas of difference. This approach provides consistent levels of protection for
similar systems.

                                                                     Use for All Systems
                                                                    Guide for Developing Security
                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems




                         Example for Multiple Similar Systems

   A general support system in Washington, D.C., provides distributed application and
   telecommunications support for three remote sites located in California, Colorado, and
   Alaska. A separate security plan may be prepared for each location (a total of four
   plans) or a single plan may be prepared with abbreviated, subordinate plans for each
   remote site. Specifically, a "master plan" would be developed for the Washington,
   D.C., site by the organization that has responsibility for system development,
   operation, and maintenance. Remote site security plans would be a shorter "system
   site plan" that references the security plan for the Washington, D.C., system (using its

   unique name identifier) and that contains information unique to the site (e.g., physical,
   environmental, responsible individuals, hardware, contingency plan, risk assessment,
   authorization for processing, and milestone or completion dates for planned controls).
   System plans that reference the master plan must also be listed in the master plan by
   their unique name identifiers.


   This approach facilitates analysis of the security provided to the entire distributed
   system and helps ensure that there are no weak security links.




2.3     System Category

The next step is to categorize each system as either a "major application" or as a
"general support system." All applications should be covered by a security plan. The
applications will either be covered individually if they have been designated as a major
application or within the security plan of a general support system.   A system may be
designated as a major application even though it is also supported by a system that has
been designated as a general support system. For example, a LAN may be designated a
general support system and have a security plan. The organization's accounting system
may be designated as a major application even though it is supported by the computing
and communication resources of the LAN. In this example, the major application
requires additional security requirements due to the sensitivity of the information the
application processes. When a security plan is required for a major application that is
supported by a general support system, coordination of both plans is required.



2.3.1   Major Applications

All federal applications have value and require some level of protection. Certain
applications, because of the information they contain, process, or transmit or because of
their criticality to the organization's missions, require special management oversight.
These applications are major applications.




                                             6
                                                                      Use for All Systems
                                                                    Guide for Developing Security
                                                         Plans for Information Technology Systems


Agencies are expected to exercise management judgment in determining which of their
appHcations are major apphcations and to ensure that the security requirements of non-
major apphcations are discussed as part of the security plan for the applicable general
support systems.


Major applications are systems that perform clearly defined functions for which there are
readily identifiable security considerations and needs (e.g., an electronic funds transfer
system).   A major application might comprise many individual programs and hardware,
software, and telecommunications components. These components can be a single
software application or a combination of hardware/software focused on supporting a
specific mission-related function.   A major application may also consist of multiple
individual applications if all are related to a single mission function (e.g., payroll or
personnel). If a system is defined as a major application and the application is run on
another organization's general support system:


•   Notify the system owner that the application is critical or contains sensitive
    information and provide specific security requirements;


•   Provide a copy of the major application's security plan to the operator of the general
    support system;


•   Request a copy of the system security plan of the general support system and ensure it
    provides adequate protection for the application and information; and


•   Include a reference to the general support system security plan, including the unique
    name/identifier information in Section 3.5, System Environment.




2.3.2   General Support System

A general support system is interconnected information resources under the same direct
management control which shares common functionality. A general support system
normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications,
facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and/or applications.     A
general support system, for example, can be a:


•   LAN including smart terminals that support a branch office;

•   Backbone (e.g., agency-wide);

•   Communications network;

•   Departmental data processing center including its operating system and utilities,


•   Tactical radio network; or


•   Shared information processing service organization.

A major application can run on a general support system. The general support system
plan should reference the major application plan(s) in Section 3.4, General
Description/Purpose.

3       Plan Development — All Systems

The remainder of this document guides the reader in writing a security plan. This section
provides and requires general information that apphes to all systems. Note:      A template
of all sections contained in a security plan is provided in Appendix C. The template is
separated into two formats, one for major applications and one for general support
systems.




3.1      Plan Control

All security plans, at a minimum, should be marked, handled, and controlled to the level
of sensitivity determined by organizational policy. In addition, all security plans should
be dated for ease of tracking modifications and approvals. Dating each page of a security
plan may be appropriate if updates are to be made through change pages. All plans begin
with the following system identification section.



3.2      System Identification

The first section of the plan provides basic identifying information about the system.
Both types of plans must contain general descriptive information regarding who is
responsible for the system, the purpose of the system, and the sensitivity level of the
system.



3.2.1     System Name/Title

The plan begins with listing the name and title of the system/application. Each
system/application should be assigned a unique name/identifier. Assigning a unique
identifier to each system helps to ensure that appropriate security requirements are met
based on the unique requirements for the system, and that allocated resources are
appropriately applied. Further, the use of unique system identifiers is integral to the IT
system investment models and analyses established under the requirements of the
Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (also known as the Clinger-
Cohen Act). The identifier could be a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters
and can be used in combination with the system/application name. The unique
name/identifier should remain the same throughout the life of the system to allow the
organization to track completion of security requirements over time. Note: If no unique
name/identifier has been assigned or is not known, contact the security or information
resource management office for assistance.

3.2.3   Information Contact(s)

List the name, title, organization, and telephone number of one or more persons
designated to be the point(s) of contact for this system.   One of the contacts given should
be identified as the system owner. The designated persons should have sufficient
knowledge of the system to be able to provide additional information or points of contact,
as needed.

3.2.4     Assignment of Security Responsibility

An individual must be assigned responsibility in writing to ensure that the application or
general support system has adequate security. To be effective, this individual must be
knowledgeable of the management, operational, and technical controls used to protect the
system.


Include the name, title, and telephone number of the individual who has been assigned
responsibility for the security of the system.

3.3     System Operational Status

Indicate one or more of the following for the system's operational status. If more than
one status is selected, list which part of the system is covered under each status.

•   Operational    —    the system is operating.


•   Under development        —   the system is being designed, developed, or implemented.


•   Undergoing a major modification        —   the system is undergoing a major conversion or
          transition.


If the system is under development or undergoing a major modification, provide
information about the methods used to assure that up-front security requirements are
included. Include specific controls in the appropriate sections of the plan depending on
where the system is in the security life cycle.



3.4     General Description/Purpose

Present a brief description (one-three paragraphs) of the function and purpose of the
system (e.g., economic indicator, network support for an organization, business census
data analysis, crop reporting support).

If the system is a general support system, list all applications supported by the general
support system. Specify if the application is or is not a major application and include
unique name/identifiers, where applicable. Describe each application's function and the
information processed. Include a list of user organizations, whether they are internal or
external to the system owner's organization, and a general description of the type of
information and processing provided. Request information from the application owners
(and a copy of the security plans for major applications) to ensure their requirements are
met.




 3.5      System Environment

Provide a brief (one-three paragraphs) general description of the technical system.
Include any envirormiental or technical factors that raise special security concerns, such
as:


•     The system is connected to the Internet;

•     It is   located in a harsh or overseas environment;


•     Software is rapidly implemented;


•     The software resides on an open network used by the general public or with overseas
      access;


•     The application is processed at a facility outside of the organization's control; or

•     The general support mainframe has dial-up lines.




                               Example System Environment

              The system is physically housed in a government-owned building located
              in Washington, D.C. The entire building is occupied by Department of
              ABC Civil Service and contractor personnel and is not open to the general
              public. The system uses mainframe hardware. The system consists of a
              Brand X 9999 supercomputer and a Brand Y 8888 mainframe
              configuration. The operating system running on the Brand X 9999 system
              is OS-YYYY and on the Brand Y 8888 system is OS-00001           .The
              security software protecting all system resources from the top levels are
              XYZ and PDQ. DOA-XX-0123, a complex, wide-area communication
              network system, provides support to client agencies nationwide.

                                                                    Guide for Developing Security
                                                         Plans for Information Technology Systems



Describe the primary computing platform(s) used (e.g., mainframe, desk top, LAN or
Wide Area Network (WAN). Include a general description of the principal system
components, including hardware, software, and communications resources. Discuss the
type of communications included (e.g., dedicated circuits, dial circuits, public data/voice
networks, Internet). Describe controls used to protect communication lines in the
appropriate sections of the security plan.


Include any security software protecting the system and information. Describe in general
terms the type of security protection provided (e.g., access control to the computing
platform and stored files at the operating system level or access to data records within an
application).   Include only controls that have been implemented or are planned, rather
than listing the controls that are available in the software. Controls that are available, but
not implemented, provide no protection.




3.6    System Interconnection/Information Sharing

System interconnection is the direct connection of systems for the purpose of sharing
information resources. System interconnection, if not appropriately protected, may result
in a compromise of all connected systems and the data they store, process, or transmit. It
is important that system operators, information owners, and management obtain as much

information as possible about the vulnerabilities associated with system interconnection
and information sharing and the increased controls required to mitigate those
vulnerabilities.   The security plan for the systems often serves as a mechanism to effect
this security information exchange and allows management to make informed decisions
regarding risk reduction and acceptance.


0MB Circular A- 130 requires that written management authorization (often in the form
of a Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement,) be obtained prior to connecting with
other systems and/or sharing sensitive data/information. The written authorization shall
detail the rules of behavior and controls that must be maintained by the interconnecting
systems. A description of the rules for interconnecting systems and for protecting shared
data must be included with this security plan. See Section 4.3, Rules of Behavior.


In this section, provide the following information concerning the authorization for the
connection to other systems or the sharing of information:


•   List of interconnected systems (including Internet);


•   Unique system identifiers, if appropriate;

•   Name of system(s);

•   Organization owning the other system(s);


•   Type of interconnection (TCP/IP, Dial, SNA, etc.);

•   Short discussion of major concerns or considerations in determining interconnection
    (do not repeat the system rules included in Section 4.3);


•   Name and title of authorizing management official(s);

•   Date of authorization;

•   System of Record, if applicable (Privacy Act data);

•   Sensitivity level of each system;


•   Interaction among systems; and


•   Security concerns and Rules of Behavior of the other systems that need to be
    considered in the protection of this system.




3.7     Sensitivity of Information Handled


This section provides a description of the types of information handled by the system and
an analysis of the criticality of the information. The sensitivity and criticality of the
information stored within, processed by, or transmitted by a system provides a basis for
the value of the system and is one of the major factors in risk management.        The
description will provide information to a variety of users, including:


•   Analysts/programmers who will use it to help design appropriate security controls;


•   Internal and external auditors evaluating system security measures; and


•   Managers making decisions about the reasonableness of security countermeasures.

The nature of the information sensitivity and criticality must be described in this section.
The description must contain information on applicable laws, regulations, and policies
affecting the system and a general description of sensitivity as discussed below.




3.7.1   Laws, Regulations, and Policies Affecting the System

List any laws, regulations, or policies that establish specific requirements for
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data/information in the system. The
Computer Security Act of 1987, 0MB Circular A- 130, and general agency security
requirements need not be listed since they mandate security for all systems. Each
organization should decide on the level of laws, regulations, and policies to include in the
security plan. Examples might include the Privacy Act or a specific statute or regulation
concerning the information processed (e.g., tax or census information). If the system

processes records subject to the Privacy Act, include the number and title of the Privacy
Act system(s) of records and whether the system(s) are used for computer matching
activities.,



See Appendix E for reference to the NIST Computer Security Division's Computer
Security Resource Clearinghouse (CSRC) Web site. CSRC contains information on a
wide variety of computer security resources, including a list of applicable laws and
regulations.




         Example Applicable Laws or Regulations Affecting the System

               Privacy Act of 1 974 (PL-93-579)

               0MB Circular A- 123


3.7.2   General Description of Sensitivity

Both information and information systems have distinct life cycles. It is important that
the degree of sensitivity of information be assessed by considering the requirements for
availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the information. This process should
occur at the beginning of the information system's life cycle and be re-examined during
each life cycle stage.


The integration of security considerations early in the life cycle avoids costly retrofitting
of safeguards. However, security requirements can be incorporated during any life cycle
stage. The purpose of this section is to review the system requirements against the need
for availability, integrity, and confidentiality. By performing this analysis, the value of
the system can be determined. The value is one of the first major factors in risk
management. A system may need protection for one or more of the following reasons:

•   Confidentiality


The system contains information that requires protection from unauthorized disclosure.


         Example of Information Requiring Protection             — Confidentiality
         Timed dissemination information (e.g., crop report information), personal
         information (covered by Privacy Act), proprietary business information (e.g.,
         business plans).

                                                                       Guide for Developing Security

•   Integrity


The system contains information which must be protected from unauthorized,
unanticipated, or unintentional modification.




                  Example of Information Requiring Protection              —   Integrity


        Census information, economic indicators, or financial transaction systems.



•   Availability


The system contains information or provides services which must be available on a
timely basis to meet mission requirements or to avoid substantial losses.



                 Example of Information Requiring Protection              —   Availability


                Systems critical to safety, life support, and hurricane forecasting.




Describe, in general terms, the information handled by the system and the need for
protective measures. Relate the information handled to each of the three basic protection
requirements above (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). Include a statement of
the estimated risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to or modification of information in the system.      To the extent possible, describe
this impact in terms of cost, inability to carry out mandated ftmctions, timeliness, etc.



For each of the three categories (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), indicate if
the protection requirement is:


•   High—       a critical concern of the system;


•   Medium— an        important concern, but not necessarily paramount in the organization's
    priorities; or


•   Low   — some minimal
            -                  level or security is required, but not to the same degree as the
    previous two categories.

         Examples of a General Protection Requirement Statement

A high degree of security for the system is considered mandatory to protect the
confidentiahty, integrity, and availabiUty of information.     The protection requirements
for all applications are critical concerns for the system.


                         or


Confidentiality is not a concern for this system as it contains information intended for
immediate release to the general public concerning severe storms. The integrity of the
information, however, is extremely important to ensure that the most accurate
information is provided to the public to allow them to make decisions about the safety
of their families and property. The most critical concern is to ensure that the system is
available at all times to acquire, process, and provide warning information immediately
about life-threatening storms.




                     Example Confidentiality Considerations
    Evaluation                                            Comment
       High                   The application contains proprietary business information and
                              other financial information, which if disclosed to unauthorized
                              sources, could cause unfair advantage for vendors, contractors,
                              or individuals and could result in financial loss or adverse legal
                              action to user organizations.

     Medium                   Security requirements for assuring confidentiality are of
                              moderate importance. Having access to only small portions of
                              the information has little practical purpose and the satellite
                              imagery data does not reveal information involving national
                              security.

        Low                   The mission of this system is to produce local weather forecast
                              information that is made available to the news media forecasters
                              and the general public at all times. None of the information
                              requires protection against disclosure.

              Example Integrity Considerations
Evaluation                                    Comment
  High          The application is a financial transaction system. Unauthorized or
                                                                            m

                under or over payments of obligations, fines, or penalties resulting
                from late or inadequate payments, and loss of public confidence.

 Medium         Assurance of the integrity of the information is required to the extent
                that destruction of the information would require significant
                expenaiiures oi time ano erion to replace. A.unougn corrupiea
                information would present an inconvenience to the staff, most
                information, and all vital information, is backed up by either paper
                documentation or on disk.

   Low          The system mainly contains messages and reports. If these messages
                and reports were modified by unauthorized, unanticipated or
                unintentional means, employees would detect the modifications;
                however, these modifications would not be a major concern for the
                organization.




             Example Availability Considerations
Evaluation                                    Comment
  High          The application contains persormel and payroll information
                concerning employees of the various user groups.
                Unavailability of the system could result in inability to meet
                payroll obligations and could cause work stoppage and failure of
                user organizations to meet critical mission requirements.       The
                system requires 24-hour access.

 Medium         Information availability is of moderate concern to the mission.
                Macintosh and IBM PC availability would be required within
                the four to five-day range. Information backups maintained at
                off-site storage would be sufficient to carry on with limited
                office tasks.

   Low          The system serves primarily as a server for e-mail for the seven
                users of the system. Conference messages are duplicated
                between Seattle and D.C. servers. Should the system become
                unavailable, the D.C. users would coimect to the Seattle server
                and continue to work with only the loss of old mail messages.

4     Management Controls

In this seetion, describe the management control measures (in place or planned) that are
intended to meet the protection requirements of the major application or general support
system. Management controls focus on the management of the computer security system
and the management of risk for a system. The types of control measures shall be
consistent with the need for protection of the major application or general support system.
To aid the reader, a brief explanation of the various management controls is provided.
For more detail on management controls, see NIST Special Publication 800-12, An
Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook.




4.1    Risk Assessment and Management

0MB Circular A- 130 no longer requires the preparation of a formal risk analysis.      It

does, however, require an assessment of risk as part of a risk-based approach to
determining adequate, cost-effective security for a system.   The methods used to assess
the nature and level of risk to the system should include a consideration of the major
factors in risk management: the value of the system or application, threats,
vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of current or proposed safeguards.   The methods
used should be described in at least one paragraph. For example, did the selected risk
assessment methodology identify threats, vulnerabilities, and the additional security
measures required to mitigate or eliminate the potential that those threats/vuhierabilities
could have on the system or its assets? Include the date that the system risk assessment
was conducted.   State how the identified risks relate to the requirements for
confidentiality, integrity, and availability determined for the system.


If there is no risk assessment for your system, include a milestone date (month and year)
for completion of the risk assessment. If the risk assessment is more than three years old
or there have been major changes to the system or functions, include a milestone date
(month and year) for completion of a new or updated risk assessment. Assessing the risk
to a system should be an ongoing activity to ensure that new threats and vulnerabilities
are identified and appropriate security measures are implemented.




4.2    Review of Security Controls

0MB Circular A- 130 requires that at least every three years an independent review of the
security controls for each major application be performed. For general support systems,
0MB Circular A- 130 requires that the security controls be reviewed by an independent
audit or self review at least every three years. Describe the type of review and findings
conducted on the general support system or major application in the last three years.
Include information about the last independent audit or review of the system and who
conducted the review. Discuss any findings or recommendations from the review and
include information concerning correction of any deficiencies or completion of any
recommendations. Indicate if the review identified a deficiency reportable under      0MB


                                           19
                                                                     Use for All Systems
                                                                     Guide for Developing Security
                                                          Plans for Information Technology Systems



Circular No. A- 123 or the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act if there is no
assignment of security responsibility, no security plan, or no authorization to process for
a system. Indicate in this section if an independent audit or review has not been
conducted on this system.

Security reviews, assessments, or evaluations may be conducted on your system by
internal or external organizations or groups.   Such reviews include ones conducted on
your facility or site by physical security specialists from other components of your
organization, system audits, or security program reviews performed by your Inspector
General's staff or contractors. These reviews may evaluate the security of the total
system or a logical segment/subsystem. The system descriptions, findings, and
recommendations from these types of reviews may serve as the independent review, if the
review is thorough, and may provide information to support your risk assessment and risk
management. If other types of security evaluations have been conducted on your system,
include information about who performed the review, when the review was performed,
the purpose of the review, the findings, and the actions taken as a result of the review.


The review or audit should be independent of the manager responsible for the major
application or general support system. Independent audits can be internal or external but
should be performed by an individual or organization free from personal and external
factors which could impair their independence or their perceived independence (e.g., they
designed the system under review). For some high-risk systems with rapidly changing
technology, three years may be too long and reviews may need to be conducted more
frequently. The objective of these reviews is to provide verification that the controls
selected and/or installed provide a level of protection commensurate with the acceptable
level of risk for the system.   The determination that the level of risk is acceptable must be
made relative to the system requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability as
well as the identified threats.


The security of a system may degrade over time, as the technology changes, the system
evolves, or people and procedures change. Periodic reviews provide assurance that
management, operations, personnel, and technical controls are functioning effectively and
providing adequate levels of protection.


The type and rigor of review or audit should be commensurate with the acceptable level
of risk that is established in the rules for the system and the likelihood of learning usefril
information to improve security. Technical tools such as virus scanners, vulnerability
assessment products (which look for known security problems, configuration errors, and
the installation of the latest hardware/software "patches"), and penetration testing can
assist in the ongoing review of system security measures.     These tools, however, are no
substitute for a formal management review at least every three years.




4.3    Rules of Behavior

Attach the rules of behavior for the general support system or major application as an
appendix and reference the appendix number in this section, or insert the rules into this



                                             20                        Use for All Systems

                                                         Plans for Information Technology Systems



section.   A set of rules of behavior must be established for each system. The security
required by the rules is only as stringent as necessary to provide adequate security for the
system and the information it contains. The acceptable level of risk should form the basis
for determining the rules. Appendix A contains a sample rules of behavior for a financial
system, which is categorized as a major application. Appendix B contains a sample rules
of behavior for a local area network, which is categorized as a general support system.

The rules of behavior should clearly delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of
all individuals with access to the system. The rules should state the consequences of
inconsistent behavior or noncompliance. The rules should be in writing and form the
basis for security awareness and training.


Rules of Behavior shall also include appropriate limits on interconnections to other
systems and define service provision and restoration priorities. They should cover such
matters as work at home, dial-in access, connection to the Internet, use of copyrighted
works, unofficial use of government equipment, the assignment and limitation of system
privileges, and individual accountability. Rules should reflect administrative and
technical security controls in the system. For example, rules regarding password use
should be consistent with technical password features in the system. Such rules would
also include limitations on changing information, searching databases, or divulging
information. Rules of behavior may be enforced through administrative sanctions
specifically related to the system (e.g., loss of system privileges) or through more general
sanctions as are imposed for violating other rules of conduct.


The rules of behavior should be made available to every user prior to receiving
authorization for access to the system. It is recommended that the rules contain a
signature page for each user to acknowledge receipt.




4.4    Planning for Security in the Life Cycle

Although a computer security plan can be developed for a system at any point in the life
cycle, the recommended approach is to draw up the plan at the beginning of the computer
system life cycle. It is recognized that in some cases, the system may at any one time be
in several phases of the life cycle. For example, a large human resources system may be
in the operation/maintenance phase, while the older, batch-oriented, input sub-system is
being replaced by a new, distributed, interactive user interface. In this case, the life cycle
phases for the system are the disposal phase (data and equipment) related to the
retirement of the batch-oriented transaction system, the initiation and acquisition phase
associated with the replacement interactive input system, and the operations/maintenance
phase for the balance of the system.

In this section, determine which phase(s) of the life cycle the system, or parts of the
system, are in. Identify how security has been handled during the applicable life cycle
phase. Listed below is a description of each phase of the life cycle, which includes
questions that will prompt the reader to identify how security has been addressed during
the life cycle phase(s) that the major application or general support system is in. There

                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems



are many models for the IT system life cycle but most contain five basic phases:
Initiation, development/acquisition, implementation, operation, and disposal.




4.4.1   Initiation Phase


During the initiation phase, the need for a system is expressed and the purpose of the
system is documented. A sensitivity assessment can be performed which looks at the
sensitivity of the information to be processed and the system itself. If the system or part
of the system is in the initiation phase, reference the sensitivity assessment described in
Section 3.7, Sensitivity of Information Handled.




4.4.2   Development/Acquisition Phase


During this phase, the system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or
otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other defined cycles, such as the
system development cycle or the acquisition cycle.


During the first part of the development/acquisition phase, security requirements should
be developed at the same time system planners define the requirements of the system.
These requirements can be expressed as technical features (e.g., access controls),
assurances (e.g., background checks for system developers), or operational practices
(e.g., awareness and training).  If the system or part of the system is in this phase,
include a general description of any specifications that were used and whether they are
being maintained. Among the questions that should be addressed are the following:


•   During the system design, were security requirements identified?

•   Were the appropriate security controls with associated evaluation and test procedures
    developed before the procurement action?


•   Did the solicitation documents (e.g., Request for Proposals) include security
    requirements and evaluation/test procedures?


•   Did the requirements permit updating security requirements as new
    threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented?


•   If this is a purchased commercial application or the application contains commercial,
    off-the-shelf components, were security requirements identified and included in the
    acquisition specifications?

                                                                     Use for All Systems
                                                                   Guide for Developing Security
                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems



4.4.3   Implementation Phase

In the implementation phase, the system's security features should be configured and
enabled, the system should be tested and installed or fielded, and the system authorized
for processing. (See Section 4.5, Authorize Processing, for a description of that
requirement.)     A design review and systems test should be performed prior to placing the
system into operation to assure that it meets security specifications. In addition, if new
controls are added to the application or the support system, additional acceptance tests of
those new controls must be performed. This ensures that new controls meet security
specifications and do not conflict with or invalidate existing controls.   The results of the
design reviews and system tests should be fully documented, updated as new reviews or
tests are performed, and maintained in the official organization records.


If the system or parts of the system are in the implementation phase, describe when and
who conducted the design reviews and systems tests. Include information about
additional design reviews and systems tests for any new controls added after the initial
acceptance tests were completed. Discuss whether the documentation of these reviews
and tests have been kept up-to-date and maintained in the organization records.



4.4.4   Operation/Maintenance Phase

During this phase, the system performs its work. The system is almost always being
continuously modified by the addition of hardware and software and by numerous other
events. If the system is undergoing modifications, determine which phase of the life cycle
the system modifications are in and describe the security activities conducted or planned
for in that part of the system. For the system in the operation/maintenance phase, the
security plan documents the security activities. In appropriate sections of this security
plan, the following high-level items should be described:


•   Security Operations and Administration. Operation of a system involves many
    security activities. Performing backups, holding training classes, managing
    cryptographic keys, keeping up with user administration and access privileges, and
    updating security software are some examples.


•   Operational Assurance. Operational assurance examines whether a system is
    operated according to its current security requirements. This includes both the
    actions of people who operate or use the system and the functioning of technical
    controls.   A management official must authorize in writing the use of the system based
    on implementation of its security plan. (See Section 4.5, Authorize Processing for a
    description of that requirement.)


•   Audits and Monitoring. To maintain operational assurance, organizations use two
    basic methods: system audits and monitoring. These terms are used loosely within
    the computer security community and often overlap.      A system audit is a one-time or
    periodic event to evaluate security. Monitoring refers to an ongoing activity that




                                            23                       Use for All Systems
                                                                          Guide for Developing Security

    examines either the system or the users, hi general, the more "real-time" an activity
    is, the more it falls into the category of monitoring.




4.4.5       Disposal Phase


The disposal phase of the IT system life cycle involves the disposition of information,
hardware, and software. If the system or part of the system is at the end of the life cycle,
briefly describe in this section how the following items are disposed:


•   Information. Information may be moved to another system, archived, discarded, or
    destroyed.     When archiving information, consider the method for retrieving the
    information in the future. While electronic information is generally easier to retrieve
    and store, the technology used to create the records may not be readily available in
    the ftiture. Measures may also have to be taken for the future use of data that has
    been encrypted, such as taking appropriate steps to ensure the secure long-term
    storage of cryptographic keys. It is important to consider legal requirements for
    records retention when disposing of IT systems. For federal systems, system
    management officials should consult with their office responsible for retaining and
    archiving federal records.


•   Media Sanitization. The removal of information from a storage medium (such as a
    hard disk or tape) is called sanitization. Different kinds of sanitization provide
    different levels of protection.      A distinction can be made between clearing
    information (rendering it unrecoverable by keyboard attack) and purging (rendering
    information unrecoverable against laboratory attack). There are three general
    methods of purging media: overwriting, degaussing (for magnetic media only), and
    destruction.




4.5     Authorize Processing

The term "authorize processing" is the authorization granted by a management official
for a system to process information. (Note:          Some agencies refer to this authorization as
accreditation.) Authorization provides a form of quality control and is required under
0MB Circular A- 130.              managers and technical staff to find the best fit for
                             It forces

security, given technical constraints, operational constraints, and mission requirements.
By authorizing processing in a system, a manager accepts the risk associated with it. In
this section of the plan, include the date of authorization, name, and title of management
official.    If not authorized, provide the name and title of manager requesting approval to
operate and date of request.


Both the security official and the authorizing management official have security
responsibilities. The security official is closer to the day-to-day operation of the system
and will direct, perform, or monitor security tasks. The authorizing official will normally
have general responsibility for the organization supported by the system. Authorization is

                                                                       Guide for Developing Security
                                                            Plans for Information Technology Systems



not a decision that should be made by the security staff.Some agencies have established
the system approval process as a formal accreditation procedure where the approving
authority is termed the Designated Approving/Accreditation Authority (DAA).
Formalization of the system authorization process reduces the potential that systems will
be placed into a production environment without appropriate management review.

Management authorization must be based on an assessment of management, operational,
and technical controls. Since the security plan establishes the system protection
requirements and documents the security controls in the system, it should form the basis
for the authorization. Authorization is usually supported by a technical evaluation and/or
security evaluation, risk assessment, contingency plan, and signed rules of behavior.
Note:   Some agencies refer to the technical evaluation and/or security evaluation as a
certification review. Re-authorization should occur prior to a significant change in the
system, but at least every three years.   It should be   done more often where there is high
risk and potential magnitude of harm.


Below is the minimum security controls that must be in place prior to authorizing a
system for processing. The level of controls should be consistent with the level of
sensitivity the system contains.


•   Technical and/or security evaluation complete.


•   Risk assessment conducted.


•   Rules of behavior established and signed by users.


•   Contingency plan developed and tested.


•   Security plan developed, updated, and reviewed.


•   System meets all applicable federal laws, regulations, policies, guidelines, and
    standards.


•   hi-place and planned security safeguards appear to be adequate and cippropriate for
    the system.


•   In-place safeguards are operating as intended.

5    Operational Controls

Beginning in this chapter and continuing through Chapter 6, Technical Controls, there are
two formats and related guidance provided: one format and related guidance for major
applications and another set for general support systems. From this chapter on, there is
enough of a difference between the controls for a major application and a general support
system to warrant a division by system type. The section numbering of these two
chapters differs from the rest of the document. The two chapters are numbered as 5.     MA
and 6.MA for Major Application, then 5.GSS and 6.GSS for General Support System.

A template of all sections contained in a security plan is provided in Appendix C. The
template is separated into two formats, one for Major Applications and another for
General Support Systems.

5.MA. Major Application - Operational Controls

The operational controls address security methods that focus on mechanisms that
primarily are implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). These
controls are put in place to improve the security of a particular system (or group of
systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise — and often rely upon
management activities as well as technical controls. In this section, describe the
operational control measures (in place or planned) that are intended to meet the
protection requirements of the major application.




 5.MA.1        Personnel Security

The greatest harm/disruption to a system comes from the actions of individuals, both
intentional and unintentional. All too often, systems experience disruption, damage, loss,
or other adverse impact due to the well-intentioned actions of individuals authorized to
use or maintain a system (e.g., the programmer who inserts one minor change, then
installs the program into the production environment without testing).



hi this section, include detailed information about the following personnel security
measures. It is recommended that most of these measures be included as part of the Rules
of Behavior.    If they are incorporated in the Rules of Behavior, reference the applicable
section.


•   Have all positions been reviewed for sensitivity level? If all positions have not been
    reviewed, state the planned date for completion of position sensitivity analysis.


•   A statement as to whether individuals have received the background screening
    appropriate for the position to which they are assigned. If all individuals have not had
    appropriate background screening, include the date by which such screening will be
    completed.


•   If individuals are permitted system access prior to completion of appropriate
    background screening, describe the conditions under which this is allowed and any
    compensating controls to mitigate the associated risk.


•   Is user access restricted (least privilege) to data files, to processing capability, or to

    peripherals and type of access (e.g., read, write, execute, delete) to the minimum
    necessary to perform the job?


•   Are critical functions divided among different individuals (separation of duties) to
    ensure that no individual has all necessary authority or information access which
    could result in fraudulent activity?


•   Is there a process for requesting, establishing, issuing, and closing user accounts?

•   What are the termination procedures for a friendly termination and an unfriendly
    termination?




 5.MA.2 Physical and Environmental Protection

Physical and environmental security controls are implemented to protect the facility
housing system resources, the system resources themselves, and the facilities used to
support their operation.   An organization's physical and environmental security program
should address the following seven topics which are explained below. In this section,
briefly describe the physical and environmental controls in place for the major
application




5.MA.2.1 Explanation of Physical and Environment Security

Access Controls. Physical access controls restrict the entry and exit of personnel (and
often equipment and media) from an area, such as an office building, suite, data center, or
room containing a local area network (LAN) server. Physical access controls should
address not only the area containing system hardware, but also locations of wiring used to
connect elements of the system, supporting services (such as electric power), backup
media, and any other elements requu^ed for the system's operation. It is important to
review the effectiveness of physical access controls in each area, both during normal
business hours and at other times — particularly when an area may be unoccupied.


Fire Safety Factors. Building fires are a particularly important security threat because of
the potential for complete destruction of both hardware and data, the risk to human life,
and the pervasiveness of the damage. Smoke, corrosive gases, and high humidity from a
localized fire can damage systems throughout an entire building. Consequently, it is
important to evaluate the fire safety of buildings that house systems.


Failure of Supporting Utilities. Systems and the people who operate them need to have a
reasonably well-controlled operating environment. Consequently, failures of electric
power, heating and air-conditioning systems, water, sewage, and other utilities will
usually cause a service interruption and may damage hardware. Organizations should
ensure that these utilities, including their many elements, function properly.


Structural Collapse.   Organizations should be aware that a building may be subjected to a
load greater than it can support. Most commonly this results from an earthquake, a snow
load on the roof beyond design criteria, an explosion that displaces or cuts structural
members, or a fire that weakens structural members.
Plumbing Leaks. While plumbing leaks do not occur every day, they can be seriously
disruptive. An organization should know the location of plumbing lines that might

                                                                   Guide for Developing Security
                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems


endanger system hardware and take steps to reduce risk (e.g., moving hardware,
relocating plumbing lines, and identifying shutoff valves.)


Interception of Data. Depending on the type of data a system processes, there may be a
significant risk if the data is intercepted. Organizations should be aware that there are
three routes of data interception: direct observation, interception of data transmission,
and electromagnetic interception.

Mobile and Portable Systems. The analysis and management of risk usually has to be
modified if a system is installed in a vehicle or is portable, such as a laptop computer.
The system in a vehicle will share the risks of the vehicle, including accidents and theft,
as well as regional and local risks.   Organizations should:


•   Securely store laptop computers when they are not in use; and


•   Encrypt data files on stored media, when cost-effective, as a precaution against
    disclosure of information if a laptop computer is lost or stolen.

Appropriate and adequate controls will vary depending on the individual system
requirements.     The example list shows the types of controls for an application residing on
a system in a computer room.     The list is not intended to be all-inclusive or to imply that
all systems should have all controls listed.

In this section, provide a synopsis of the procedures in place that support the operations
of the application. Below is a sampling of topics that should be reported.


•     User support.   Is there a help desk or group that offers advice and can respond to

      security incidents in a timely manner? Are there procedures in place documenting

    how to recognize, handle, and report incidents and/or problems? Additional
    questions are provided in Section 5.GSS.8, hicident Response Capability.


•   Procedures to ensure unauthorized individuals cannot read, copy, alter, or steal
    printed or electronic information.


•   Procedures for ensuring that only authorized users pick up, receive, or deliver input
    and output information and media.


•   Audit trails for receipt of sensitive inputs/outputs.


•   Procedures for restricting access to output products.


•   Procedures and controls used for transporting or mailing media or printed output.


•   hitemal/extemal labeling for appropriate sensitivity      (e.g.. Privacy Act, Proprietary).



•   External labeling with special handling instructions (e.g., log/inventory identifiers,
    controlled access, special storage instructions, release or destruction dates).


•   Audit trails for inventory management.


•   Media storage vault or library physical and environmental protection controls and
    procedures.


•   Procedures for sanitizing electronic media for reuse (e.g., overwrite or degaussing of
    electronic media).


•   Procedures for controlled storage, handling, or destruction of spoiled media or media
    that cannot be effectively sanitized for reuse.


•   Procedures for shredding or other destructive measures for hardcopy media when no
    longer required.




5.MA.4 Contingency Planning

Procedures are required that will permit the organization to continue essential functions if
information technology support is interrupted. These procedures (contingency plans,
business interruption plans, and continuity of operations plans) should be coordinated
with the backup, contingency, and recovery plans of any general support systems,
including networks used by the application.      The contingency plans should ensure that
interfacing systems are identified and contingency/disaster planning coordinated.


Briefly describe the procedures (contingency plan) that would be followed to ensure the
application continues to be processed if the supporting IT systems were unavailable and

provide the detailed plans as an attachment. Include consideration of the following
questions in this description:


•   Are tested contingency plans in place to permit continuity of mission-critical
    functions in the event of a catastrophic event?


•   Are tested disaster recovery plans in place for all supporting IT systems and
    networks?


•   Are formal written emergency operating procedures posted or located to facilitate
    their use in emergency situations?


•   How often are contingency, disaster, and emergency plans tested?

•   Are all employees trained in their roles and responsibilities relative to the emergency,
    disaster, and contingency plans?


Include descriptions of the following controls:


•   Any agreements for backup processing (e.g., hotsite contract with a commercial
    service provider).


•   Documented backup procedures including frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and
    scope (fijU backup, incremental backup, and differential backup).


•   Location of stored backups (off-site or on-site).


•   Generations of backups kept.


•   Coverage of backup procedures, e.g., what is being backed up.




5.MA.5 Application Software Maintenance Controls

These controls are used to monitor the installation of, and updates to, application
software to ensure that the software fiinctions as expected and that a historical record is
maintained of application changes. This helps ensure that only authorized software is
installed on the system.Such controls may include a software configuration policy that
grants managerial approval (re-authorize processing) to modifications and requires that
changes be documented. Other controls include products and procedures used in auditing
for or preventing illegal use of shareware or copyrighted software.   Software maintenance
procedures may also be termed version control, change management, or configuration
management. The following questions are examples of items that should be addressed in
responding to this section:

•   Was the application software developed in-house or under contract?

•   Does the government own the software?

•   Was the application software received ft-om another federal agency with the
    understanding that it is federal government property?


•   Is the application software a copyrighted commercial off-the-self product or

    shareware?


•   If a copyrighted commercial off-the-self product (or shareware), were sufficient
    licensed copies of the software purchased for all of the systems on which this
    application will be processed?


•   Is there a formal change control process in place for the application, and if so, does it

    require that all changes to the application software be tested and approved before
    being put into production?


•   Are test data "live" data or made-up data?

•   Are all changes to the application software documented?

•   Have trap door "hot keys" been activated for emergency data repairs?

•   Are test results documented?

•   How are emergency fixes handled?

•   Are there organizational policies against illegal use of copyrighted software or
    shareware?


•   Are periodic audits conducted of users' computers (PCs) to ensure only legal licensed
    copies of software are installed?


•   What products and procedures are used to protect against illegal use of software?

•   Are software warranties managed to minimize the cost of upgrades and cost-
    reimbursement or replacement for deficiencies?

    5.MA.6 Data Integrity           alidation Controls

Data integrity controls are used to protect data from accidental or malicious alteration or
destruction and to provide assurance to the user that the information meets expectations
about its quality and that it has not been altered. Validation controls refer to tests and
evaluations used to determine compliance with security specifications and requirements.


hi this section, describe any controls that provide assurance to users that the information
has not been altered and that the system functions as expected. The following questions
are examples of some of the controls that fit in this category:


•     Is virus detection and elimination software installed?   If so, are there procedures for:


      >   Updating virus signature files;


      >   Automatic and/or manual virus scans (automatic scan on network log-in,
          automatic scan on client/server power on, automatic scan on diskette insertion,
          automatic scan on download from an unprotected source such as the Internet, scan
          for macro viruses); and


      >   Virus eradication and reporting?


•     Are reconciliation routines used by the system, i.e., checksums, hash totals, record
      counts? Include a description of the actions taken to resolve any discrepancies.


•     Are password crackers/checkers used?

•     Are integrity verification programs used by applications to look for evidence of data
      tampering, errors, and omissions? Techniques include consistency and
      reasonableness checks and validation during data entry and processing. Describe the
      integrity controls used within the system.


•     Are intrusion detection tools installed on the system? Describe where the tool(s) are
     placed, the type of processes detected/reported, and the procedures for handling
      intrusions. (Reference Section 5. MA. 3 Production, Input/Output Controls if the
     procedures for handling intrusions are already described.)


•     Is system performance monitoring used to analyze system performance logs in real

      time to look for availability problems, including active attacks, and system and
      network slowdowns and crashes?


•     Is penetration testing performed on the system?   If so, what procedures are in place to
      ensure they are conducted appropriately?


•    Is message authentication used in the application to ensure that the sender of a

     message is known and that the message has not been altered during transmission?

    State whether message authentication has been determined to be appropriate for your
    system. If so, describe the methodology.



5.MA.7 Documentation

Documentation is a security control in that it explains how software/hardware is to be
used and formalizes security and operational procedures specific to the system.
Documentation for a system includes descriptions of the hardware and software, policies,
standards, procedures, and approvals related to automated information system security in
the application and the support system(s) on which it is processed, to include baciaxp and
contingency activities, as well as descriptions of user and operator procedures.


Documentation should be coordinated with the general support system and/or network
manager(s) to ensure that adequate application and installation documentation are
maintained to provide continuity of operations


List the documentation maintained for the application. The example list is provided to
show the type of documentation that would normally be maintained for a system and is
not intended to be all inclusive or imply that all systems should have all items listed.

    5.MA.8 Security Awareness and Training

The Computer Security Act requires federal agencies to provide for the mandatory
periodic training in computer security awareness and accepted computer security
practices for all employees who are involved with the management, use, or operation of a
federal computer system within or under the supervision of the federal agency. This
includes contractors as well as employees of the agency. 0MB Circular A- 130,
Appendix III, issued in 1996, enforces such mandatory training by requiring its
completion prior to granting access to the system and through periodic refresher training
for continued access. Therefore, each user must be versed in acceptable rules of
behavior for the application before being allowed access to the system. The training
program should also inform the user on how to get help when having difficulty using the
system and procedures for reporting security incidents.


Access provided to members of the public should be constrained by controls in the
applications, and training should be within the context of those controls and may consist
only of notification at the time of access.

hiclude in this section of the plan information about the following:


•     The awareness program for the application (posters, booklets, and trinkets).

•    The type and frequency of application-specific training provided to employees and
      contractor personnel (seminars, workshops, formal classroom, focus groups, role-
     based training, and on-the-job training).


•    The type and frequency of general support system training provided to employees and
     contractor personnel (seminars, workshops, formal classroom, focus groups, role-
     based training, and on-the-job training).

•    The procedures for assuring that employees and contractor personnel have been
     provided adequate training.

Note: Contractor employees are required to receive the same level of automated
information systems security awareness and training as federal employees. This training
requirement should be included as appropriate in all contracts.

6.MA Major Application - Technical Controls

Technical controls focus on security controls that the computer system executes. The
controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate
detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and
data. The implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant
operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security
within the organization. In this section, describe the technical control measures (in place
or planned) that are intended to meet the protection requirements of the major
application.




6.MA.1 Identification and Authentication

Identification and Authentication is a technical measure that prevents unauthorized
people (or unauthorized processes) from entering an IT system. Access control usually
requires that the system be able to identify and differentiate among users. For example,
access control is often based on least privilege, which refers to the granting to users of
only those accesses minimally required to perform their duties. User accountability
requires the linking of activities on an IT system to specific individuals and, therefore,
requires the system to identify users.




6.MA.1.1 Identification

Identification is the means by which a user provides a claimed identity to the system.
The most common form of identification is the user ID.     In this section of the plan,
briefly describe how the major application identifies access to the system


Unique Identification. An organization should require users to identify themselves
uniquely before being allowed to perform any actions on the system unless user
anonymity or other factors dictate otherwise.

Correlate Actions to Users.   The system should internally maintain the identity of all
active users and be able to link actions to specific users. (See Section 6.MA.4, Audit
Trails.)


Maintenance of User IDs. An organization should ensure that all user IDs belong to
currently authonztd users. Identification data must be kept current by adding new users
and deleting former users.

Inactive User IDs. User IDs that are inactive on the system for a specific period of time
(e.g., three months) should be disabled.

6.MA.1.2 Authentication

Authentication is the means of establishing the validity of a user's claimed identity to the
system. There are three means of authenticating a user's identity which can be used alone
or in combination: something the individual knows (a secret - e.g., a password, Personal
Identification Number (PIN), or cryptographic key); something the individual possesses
(a token~ e.g., an ATM card or a smart card); and something the individual is (a
biometrics ~ e.g., characteristics such as a voice pattern, handwriting dynamics, or a
fingerprint).


In this section, describe the major application's authentication control mechanisms.
Below is a list of items that should be considered in the description:

•   Describe the method of user authentication (password, token, and biometrics).


•   If a password system is used, provide the following specific information:


    •   Allowable character set,
    •   Password length (minimum, maximum),
    •   Password aging time frames and enforcement approach,
    •   Number of generations of expired passwords disallowed for use,
    •   Procedures for password changes,
    •   Procedures for handling lost passwords, and
    •   Procedures for handling password compromise.


•   Procedures for training users and the materials covered.


Note: The recommended minimum number of characters in a password is six to eight
characters in a combination of alpha, numeric, or special characters.


•   Indicate the frequency of password changes, describe how password changes are
    enforced (e.g., by the software or System Administrator), and identify who changes
    the passwords (the user, the system, or the System Administrator).


•   Describe any biometrics controls used. Include a description of how the biometrics
    controls are implemented on the system.


•   Describe any token controls used on the system and how they are implemented.


    >   Are special hardware readers required?

    >   Are users required to use a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN)?

    > Who selects the PIN, the user or System Administrator?

    > Does the token use a password generator to create a one-time password?

    >   Is a challenge-response protocol used to create a one-time password?



•   Describe the level of enforcement of the access control mechanism (network,
    operating system, and application).


•   Describe how the access control mechanism supports individual accountability and
    audit trails (e.g., passwords are. associated with a user identifier that is assigned to a
    single individual).


•   Describe the self-protection techniques for the user authentication mechanism (e.g.,
    passwords are transmitted and stored with one-way encryption to prevent anyone
    [including the System Administrator] from reading the clear-text passwords,
    passwords are automatically generated, passwords are checked against a dictionary of
    disallowed passwords, passwords are encrypted while in transmission).


•   State the number of invalid access attempts that may occur for a given user identifier
    or access location (terminal or port) and describe the actions taken when that limit is
    exceeded.


•   Describe the procedures for verifying that all system-provided administrative default
    passwords have been changed.


•   Describe the procedures for limiting access scripts with embedded passwords (e.g.,
    scripts with embedded passwords are prohibited, scripts with embedded passwords
    are allowed only for batch applications).


•   Describe any policies that provide for bypassing user authentication requirements,
    single-sign-on technologies (e.g., host-to-host, authentication servers, user-to-host
    identifier, and group user identifiers) and any compensating controls.



•   If digital signatures are used, the technology must conform with Federal Information
    Processing Standards (FIPS) 186, Digital Signature Standard and PIPS 180-1, Secure
    Hash Standard issued by NIST, unless a waiver has been granted. Describe any use
    of digital or electronic signatures. Address the following specific issues:


    •   State the digital signature standards used. If the standards used are not NIST
        standards, please state the date the waiver was granted and the name and title of
        the official granting the waiver.


    •   Describe the use of electronic signatures and the security control provided.


    •   Discuss cryptographic key management procedures for key generation,
        distribution, storage, entry, use, destruction and archiving.

    6.MA.2 Logical Access Controls (Authorization/Access Controls)

Logical access controls are the system-based mechanisms used to specify who or what
(e.g., in the case of a process) is to have access to a specific system resource and the type

of access that is permitted.


hi this section, discuss the controls in place to authorize or restrict the activities of users
and system personnel within the application. Describe hardware or software features that
are designed to permit only authorized access to or within the application, to restrict users
to authorized transactions and functions, and/or to detect unauthorized activities (e.g.,
access control lists).   The following are areas that should be considered.

•     Describe formal policies that define the authority that will be granted to each user or
      class of users. Indicate if these policies follow the concept of least privilege which
      requires identifying the user's job functions, determining the minimum set of
      privileges required to perform that function, and restricting the user to a domain with
      those privileges and nothing more. Liclude in the description the procedures for
      granting new users access and the procedures for when the role or job function
      changes.


•     Identify whether the policies include separation of duties enforcement to prevent an
      individual from having all necessary authority or information access to allow
      fraudulent activity without collusion.


•     Describe the application's capability to establish an Access Control List or register of
      the users and the types of access they are permitted.


•     Indicate whether a manual Access Control List is maintained.


•     Indicate if the security software allows application owners to restrict the access rights
      of other application users, the general support system administrator, or operators to
      the application programs, data, or files.


•     Describe how application users are restricted from accessing the operating system,
      other applications, or other system resources not needed in the performance of their
      duties.


•     Indicate how often Access Control Lists are reviewed to identify and remove users
      who have left the organization or whose duties no longer require access to the
      application.


•     Describe controls to detect unauthorized transaction attempts by authorized and/or
      unauthorized users.

                                                         Plans for Information Technology Systems


•   Describe policy or logical access controls that regulate how users may delegate access
    permissions or make copies of files or information accessible to other users. This
    "discretionary access control" may be appropriate for some applications, and
    inappropriate for others.   Document any evaluation made to justify/support use of
    "discretionary access control."


•   hidicate after what period of user inactivity the system automatically blanks
    associated display screens and/or after what period of user inactivity the system
    automatically disconnects inactive users or requires the user to enter a unique
    password before reconnecting to the system or application.


•   Describe any restrictions to prevent users fi"om accessing the system or applications
    outside of normal work hours or on weekends.       Discuss in-place restrictions.


•   Indicate if encryption is used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files as part
    of the system or application access control procedures.    (If encryption is used
    primarily for authentication, include this information in the section above.) If
    encryption is used as part of the access controls, provide information about the
    following:


    > What cryptographic methodology (e.g., secret key and public key) is used? If a
        specific off-the-shelf product is used, provide the name of the product. If the
        product and the implementation method meet federal standards (e.g.. Data
        Encryption Standard, Digital Signature Standard), include that information.


    >   Discuss cryptographic key management procedures for key generation,
        distribution, storage, entry, use, destruction, and archiving.


•   If your application is running on a system that is connected to the Internet or other
    wide area network(s), discuss what additional hardware or technical controls have
    been installed and implemented to provide protection against unauthorized system
    penetration and other known Internet threats and vulnerabilities.


•   Describe any type of secure gateway or firewall in use, including its configuration,
    (e-g., configured to restrict access to critical system resources and to disallow certain

    types of traffic to pass through to the system).


•   Provide information regarding any port protection devices used to require specific
    access authorization to the communication ports, including the configuration of the
    port protection devices, and if additional passwords or tokens are required.


•   Identify whether internal security labels are used to control access to specific
    information types or files, and if such labels specify protective measures or indicate
    additional handling instructions.

•       Indicate if host-based authentication is used. (This is an access control approach that
        grants access based on the identity of the host originating the request, instead of the
        individual user requesting access.)


It is   recommended that a standardized log-on banner be placed on the system. Public Law
99-474 requires that a warning message be displayed, notifying unauthorized users that
they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and unauthorized use can be
punished by fines or imprisormient. Some of the systems now in use are intended for
unrestricted use by the general public (e.g., Internet-based systems used for widespread
public information dissemination), a situation not prevalent when Public Law 99-474 was
enacted.     Due to their adverse impact on the intended user population, highly restrictive
warning barmers may not be appropriate. The choice of which screen warning barmer to
implement is up to the system owner and should be based on system-specific technology
limitations, data sensitivity, or other unique system requirements. In this section, describe
the rationale for electing to use or not use warning banners and provide an example of the
baimers used. Where appropriate, state whether the Department of Justice, Computer
Crime and Intellectual Properties Section, approved the warning banner.

    6.MA.3 Public Access Controls

Where an organization's application promotes or permits public access, additional
security controls are needed to protect the integrity of the application and the confidence
of the public in the application. Such controls include segregating information made
directly accessible to the public from official organization records.


Public access systems are subject to a greater threat from outside attacks. In public
access systems, users are often anonymous and untrained in the system and their
responsibilities. Attacks on public access systems could have a substantial impact on the
organization's reputation and the level of public trust and confidence. Threats from
insiders are also greater (e.g., errors introduced by disgruntled employees or unintentional
errors by untrained users).


If the public accesses the major application, describe the additional controls in place.      The
following list describes the type of controls that might provide protection in a public
access system and issues that should be considered.     It is not intended to   include all
possible controls or issues.


•     Some form of identification and authentication (this may be difficult).

•     Access control to limit what the user can read, write, modify, or delete.


•     Controls to prevent public users from modifying information on the system.


•     Digital signatures.


•     CD-ROM for on-line storage of information for distribution.

•     Put copies of information for public access on a separate system.


•     Prohibit public to access "live" databases.


•     Verify that programs and information distributed to the public are virus-free.


•     Audit trails and user confidentiality.


•     System and data availability.

•     Legal considerations.

6.MA.4 Audit Trails

Audit trails maintain a record of system activity by system or application processes and
by user activity.   In conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit trails can
provide a means to help accomplish several security-related objectives, including
individual accountability, reconstruction of events, intrusion detection, and problem
identification. In this section, describe the audit trail mechanisms in place.    A list of
items to consider are provided below:


•   Does the audit trail support accountability by providing a trace of user actions?

•   Can the audit trail support after-the-fact investigations of how, when, and why normal
    operations ceased?


•   Are audit trails designed and implemented to record appropriate information that can
    assist in intrusion detection?


•   Are audit trails used as online tools to help identify problems other than intrusions as
    they occur?


•   Does the audit trail include sufficient information to establish what events occurred
    and who (or what) caused them? In general, an event record should specify;

    > Type of event;

    > When the event occurred;

    >   User ID associated with the event; and

    > Program or command used to initiate the event.

•   Is access to online audit logs strictly controlled?



•   Is there separation of duties between security personnel    who administer the access
    control function and those who administer the audit trail?


•   Is the confidentiality of audit trail information protected if, for example, it records

    personal information about users?


•   Describe how frequently audit trails are reviewed and whether there are review
    guidelines.


•   Can the audit trail be queried by user ID, terminal ID, application name, date and
    time, or some other set of parameters to run reports of selected information?

                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems


•   Does the appropriate system-level or application-level administrator review the audit
    trails following a   known system or application software problem, a known violation
    of existing requirements by a user, or some unexplained system or user problem?

•   Audit analysis tools, such as those based on audit reduction, attack signature, and
    variance techniques, can be used in a real-time or near real-time fashion. Does the
    organization use the many types of tools that have been developed to help reduce the
    amount of information contained in audit records, as well as to distill useftil
    information from the raw data?


Keystroke monitoring is the process used to view or record both the keystrokes entered
by a computer user and the computer's response during an interactive session. Keystroke
monitoring is usually considered a special case of audit trails. The Department of Justice
has advised that an ambiguity in U.S. law makes it unclear whether keystroke monitoring
is considered equivalent to an unauthorized telephone wiretap.    If keystroke monitoring is
used in audit trails, organizations should have a written policy and notify users. The
Rules of Behavior may be one vehicle for distributing the information. If keystroke
monitoring is used, provide reference to the policy and the means of notification. Also
indicate whether the Department of Justice has reviewed the policy.

5.GSS General Support System — Operational Controls

The operational controls address security mechanisms that focus on methods that
primarily are implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). These
controls are put in place to improve the security of a particular system (or group of
systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and often rely upon
management activities as well as technical controls, hi this section, describe the
operational control measures (in place or planned) that are intended to meet the
protection requirements of the general support system.




5.GSS.1 Personnel Controls

The greatest harm/disruption to a system comes from the actions of individuals, both
intentional and unintentional. All too often, systems experience disruption, damage, loss,
or other adverse impact due to the well-intentioned actions of individuals authorized to
use or maintain a system (e.g., the programmer who inserts one minor change, then
installs the program into the production environment without testing).



In this section, include detailed information about the following personnel security
measures. It is recommended that most of these measures be included as part of the rules
of behavior.   If they are incorporated in the rules of behavior, reference the applicable
section.


•   Have all positions been reviewed for sensitivity level? If all positions have not been
    reviewed, state the planned date for completion of position sensitivity analysis.


•   A statement as to whether individuals have received the background screening
    appropriate for the position to which they are assigned. If all individuals have not had
    appropriate background screening, include the date by which such screening will be
    completed.


•   If individuals are permitted system access prior to completion of appropriate
    background screening, describe the conditions under which this is allowed and any
    compensating controls to mitigate the associated risk.


•   Are users access restricted (least privilege) to data files, to processing capability, or to
    peripherals and type of access (e.g., read, write, execute, delete) to the minimum
    necessary to perform the job?


•   Are critical ftinctions divided among different individuals (separation of duties) to
    ensure that no individual has all necessary authority or information access which
    could result in fraudulent activity?


•   Is there a process for requesting, establishing, issuing, and closing user accounts?

•   What mechanisms are in place for holding user's responsible for their actions?

•   What are the termination procedures for a friendly termination and an unfriendly
    termination?




 5.GSS.2 Physical and Environmental Protection

Physical and environmental security controls are implemented to protect the facility
housing system resources, the system resources themselves, and the facilities used to
support their operation.   An organization's physical and environmental security program
should address the following seven topics which are explained below, hi this section,
briefly describe the physical and environmental controls in place or planned for the
general support system.




5.GSS.2.1 Explanation of Physical and Environment Security


Access Controls. Physical access controls restrict the entry and exit of personnel (and
often equipment and media) from an area, such as an office building, suite, data center, or
room containing a local area network (LAN) server. Physical access controls should
address not only the area containing system hardware, but also locations of wiring used to
connect elements of the system, supporting services (such as electric power), backup
media, and any other elements required for the system's operation. It is important to
review the effectiveness of physical access controls in each area, both during normal
business hours and at other times ~ particularly when an area may be unoccupied.


Fire Safety Factors. Building fu-es are a particularly important security threat because of
the potential for complete destruction of both hardware and data, the risk to human life,
and the pervasiveness of the damage. Smoke, corrosive gases, and high humidity from a
localized fire can damage systems throughout an entire building. Consequently, it is
important to evaluate the fire safety of buildings that house systems.


Failure of Supporting Utilities. Systems and the people who operate them need to have a
reasonably well-controlled operating environment. Consequently, failures of electric
power, heating and air-conditioning systems, water, sewage, and other utilities will
usually cause a service interruption and may damage hardware. Organizations should
ensure that these utilities, including their many elements, ftmction properly.


Structural Collapse.   Organizations should be aware that a building may be subjected to a
load greater than it can support. Most commonly this is a result of an earthquake, a snow
load on the roof beyond design criteria, an explosion that displaces or cuts structural
members, or a fire that weakens structural members.

                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems



Plumbing Leaks. While plumbing leaks do not occur every day, they can be seriously
disruptive. An organization should know the location of plumbing lines that might
endanger system hardware and take steps to reduce risk (e.g., moving hardware,
relocating plumbing lines, and identifying shutoff valves.)


hiterception of Data.    Depending on the type of data a system processes, there may be a
significant risk if the data is intercepted. Organizations should be aware that there are
three routes of data interception: direct observation, interception of data transmission,
and electromagnetic interception.

Mobile and Portable Systems. The analysis and management of risk usually has to be
modified if a system is installed in a vehicle or is portable, such as a laptop computer.
The system in a vehicle will share the risks of the vehicle, including accidents and theft,
as well as regional and local risks.   Organizations should:


•   Securely store laptop computers when they are not in use.


•   Encrypt data files on stored media, when cost-effective, as a precaution against
    disclosure of information if a laptop computer is lost or stolen.

•   Procedures to ensure unauthorized individuals cannot read, copy, alter, or steal
    printed or electronic information.


•   Procedures for ensuring that only authorized users pick up, receive, or deliver input
    and output information and media.


•   Audit trails for receipt of sensitive inputs/outputs.


•   Procedures for restricting access to output products.


•   Procedures and controls used for transporting or mailing media or printed output.


•   Internal/external labeling for appropriate sensitivity (e.g., Privacy Act, Proprietary).


•   External labeling with special handling instructions (e.g., log/inventory identifiers,
    controlled access, special storage instructions, release or destruction dates).


•   Audit trails for inventory management.


•   Media storage vault or library physical and environmental protection controls and
    procedures.


•   Procedures for sanitizing electronic media for reuse (e.g., overwrite or degaussing of
    electronic media).


•   Procedures for controlled storage, handling, or destruction of spoiled media or media
    that carmot be effectively sanitized for reuse.


•   Procedures for shredding or other destructive measures for hardcopy media when no
    longer required.




5.GSS.4        Contingency Planning (Continuity of Support)

General support systems require appropriate emergency, backup, and contingency plans.
These plan? should be tested regularly to assure the continuity of support in the event of
system failure. Also, these plans should be known to users and coordinated with their
plans for applications.


Describe the procedures (contingency plan) that would be followed to ensure the system
continues to process all critical applications if a disaster should occur and provide a
reference to the detailed plans, hiclude consideration of the following questions in this
description:

•   Are all employees trained in their roles and responsibilities relative to the emergency,
    disaster, and contingency plans?


Include descriptions of the following controls.


•   Any agreements for backup processing (e.g., hotsite contract with a commercial
    service provider).


•   Documented backup procedures including frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and
    scope (full backup, incremental backup, and differential backup).


•   Location of stored backups (off-site or on-site).


•   Generations of backups kept.


•   Coverage of backup procedures, e.g., what is being backed up.



5.GSS.5 Hardware and System Software Maintenance Controls

These controls are used to monitor the installation of, and updates to, hardware, operating
system software, and other software to ensure that the hardware and software ftinction as
expected, and that a historical record is maintained of application changes. These
controls may also be used to ensure that only authorized software is installed on the
system. Such controls may include a hardware and software configuration policy that
grants managerial approval (re-authorize processing) to modifications and requires that
changes be documented. Other controls include products and procedures used in auditing
for, or preventing, illegal use of shareware or copyrighted software. In this section,

provide several paragraphs on the hardware and system software maintenance controls in
place or planned. The following statements are examples of items that should be
addressed in responding to this section:


•   Are procedures in place to ensure that maintenance and repair activities are
    accomplished without adversely affecting system security? Consider the following
    items:

      reimbursement or replacement for deficiencies?




    5.GSS.6 Integrity Controls

Integrity controls are used to protect the operating system, applications, and information
in the system from accidental or malicious alteration or destruction and to provide
assurance to the user that the information meets expectations about its quality and that it
has not been altered.


In this section, describe any controls that provide assurance to users that the information
has not been altered and that the system functions as expected. The following questions
are examples of some of the controls that fit in this category:


•     Is virus detection and elimination software installed?   If so, are there procedures for:


      >     Updating virus signature files;

      >     Automatic and/or manual virus scans (automatic scan on network log-in,
            automatic scan on client/server power on, automatic scan on diskette insertion,
            automatic scan on download fi'om an unprotected source such as the Internet, scan
            for macro viruses); and


      >     Virus eradication and reporting?


•     Are reconciliation routines used by the system, i.e., checksums, hash totals, record
      counts? Include a description of the actions taken to resolve any discrepancies.


•     Are password crackers/checkers used?

•     Are
•     integrity verification programs used by applications to look for evidence of data
      tampering, errors, and omissions? Techniques include consistency and
      reasonableness checks and validation during data entry and processing. Describe the
      integrity controls used within the system.


•     Is system performance monitoring used to analyze system performance logs in real

      time to look for availability problems, including active attacks, and system and
      network slowdowns and crashes?

•   Is message authentication used in the application to ensure that the sender of a

    message is known and that the message has not been altered during transmission?
    State whether message authentication has been determined to be appropriate for your
    system. If so, describe the methodology.




5.GSS.7 Documentation

Documentation is a security control in that it explains how software/hardware is to be
used and formalizes security and operational procedures specific to the system.
Documentation for a system includes descriptions of the hardware and software, policies,
standards, procedures, and approvals related to automated information system security on
the support system, including backup and contingency activities, as well as descriptions
of user and operator procedures.


List the documentation maintained for the general support system. An example list is
provided to show the type of documentation that would normally be maintained for a
system.   The list is not intended to be all-inclusive or imply that all systems should have
all items listed.




     Examples of General Support System Documentation

                    -   Vendor-supplied documentation of hardware
                    -   Vendor-supplied documentation of software
                    -   General support system security plan
                    -   Testing procedures and results
                    -   Standard operating procedures
                    -   Emergency procedures
                    -   Contingency plans
                    -   Disaster recovery plans
                    - User rules of behavior
                    - User manuals

                    - Risk assessment

                    -   Backup procedures
                    -   Authorize processing documents and statements




5.GSS.8 Security Awareness and Training

The Computer Security Act requires federal agencies to provide mandatory periodic
training in computer security awareness and accepted computer security practice for all
employees who are involved with the management, use, or operation of a federal
computer system within or under the supervision of the federal agency. This includes




                                                         Use for General Support System
                                                                           Guide for Developing Security
                                                               Plans for Information Technology Systems



contractors as well as employees of the agency.           0MB Circular A- 130, Appendix III,
issued in 1 996, enforces such mandatory training by requiring its completion prior to
granting access to the system and through periodic refresher training for continued
access. Therefore, each user must be versed in acceptable rules of behavior for the
system before being allowed access to the system. The training program should also
inform the user on how to get help when having difficulty using the system and
procedures for reporting security incidents.


Access provided to members of the public should be constrained by controls in the
applications, and training should be within the context of those controls and may consist
only of notification at the time of access.

Include in this section of the plan information about the following:


•     The awareness program for the system (posters, booklets, and trinkets).

•     The type and frequency of system-specific training provided to employees and
      contractor personnel (seminars, workshops, formal classroom, focus groups, role-
      based training, and on-the-job training).


•     The procedures for assuring that employees and contractor personnel have been
      provided adequate training.

Note: Contractor employees are required to receive the same level of automated
information systems security awareness and training as federal employees. This training
requirement should be included as appropriate in all contracts.




    5.GSS.9 Incident Response Capability

A computer security incident is an adverse event in a computer system or network caused
by a failure of a security mechanism or an attempted or threatened breach of these
mechanisms\ Computer security incidents are becoming more common and their impact
far-reaching.    When faced with an incident, an organization should be able to respond
quickly in a manner that both protects its own information and helps to protect the
information of others that might be affected by the incident.          0MB Circular A- 130
requires each agency to ensure that there is a capability to provide help to users when a
security incident occurs in the system and to share information concerning common
vulnerabilities and threats. In this section, describe the incident handling procedures in
place for the general support system. Areas of consideration include:

6.GSS General Support System - Technical Controls

Technical controls focus on security controls that the computer system executes. The
controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate
detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and
data.    The implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant
operational considerations — and should be consistent with the management of security
within the organization. In this section, describe the technical control measures (in place
or planned) that are intended to meet the protection requirements of the general support
system.




 6.GSS.1 Identification and Authentication

Identification and Authentication is a technical measure that prevents unauthorized
people (or unauthorized processes) from entering an IT system. Access control usually
requires that the system be able to identify and differentiate among users. For example,
access control is often based on least privilege, which refers to the granting to users of
only those accesses minimally required to perform their duties. User accountability
requires the linking of activities on an IT system to specific individuals and, therefore,
requires the system to identify users.




6.GSS.1.1 Identification


Identification is the means by which a user provides a claimed identity to the system.
The most common form of identification is the user ID.     In this section of the plan,
describe how the general support system identifies access to the system.


Unique Identification.    An organization should require users to identify themselves
uniquely before being allowed to perform any actions on the system unless user
anonymity or other factors dictate otherwise.

Correlate Actions to Users.    The system should internally maintain the identity of all
active users and be able to link actions to specific users. (See Section 6.GSS.4, Audit
Trails.)


Maintenance of User IDs.   An organization should ensure that all user IDs belong to
currently authorized users. Identification data must be kept current by adding new users
and deleting former users.

Inactive User IDs. User IDs that are inactive on the system for a specific period of time
(e.g.,   three months) should be disabled.

6.GSS.1.2 Authentication


Authentication is the means of estabhshing the validity of a user's claimed identity to the
system. There are three means of authenticating a user's identity which can be used alone
or in combination: something the individual knows (a secret ~ e.g., a password, Personal
Identification Number (PIN), or cryptographic key); something the individual possesses
(a token~ e.g., an ATM card or a smart card); and something the individual is (a
biometrics ~ e.g., characteristics such as a voice pattern, handwriting dynamics, or a
fingerprint).


In this section, describe the general support system's authentication control mechanisms.
Below is a list of items that should be considered in the description:

•   Describe the method of user authentication (password, token, and biometrics).


•   If a password system is used, provide the following specific information:


    >   Allowable character set;


    >   Password length (minimum, maximum);

    >   Password aging time frames and enforcement approach;

    > Number of generations of expired passwords disallowed for use;

    >   Procedures for password changes;


    >   Procedures for handling lost passwords, and


    >   Procedures for handling password compromise.


•   Procedures for training users and the materials covered.


Note: The recommended minimum number of characters for a password is six to eight
characters in a combination of alpha, numeric, or special characters.


•   Indicate- the frequency of password changes, describe how password changes are
    enforced (e.g., by the software or System Administrator), and identify who changes
    the passwords (the user, the system, or the System Administrator).


•   Describe any biometrics controls used. Include a description of how the biometrics
    controls are implemented on the system.


•   Describe any token controls used on this system and how they are implemented.


    >   Are special hardware readers required?

    > Are users required to use a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN)?

    > Who selects the PIN, the user or System Administrator?

    > Does the token use a password generator to create a one-time password? and

    >   Is a challenge-response protocol used to create a one-time password?



•   Describe the level of enforcement of the access control mechanism (network,
    operating system, and application).


•   Describe how the access control mechanism supports individual accountability and
    audit trails (e.g., passwords are associated with a user identifier that is assigned to a
    single individual).


•   Describe the self-protection techniques for the user authentication mechanism (e.g.,
    passwords are transmitted and stored with one-way encryption to prevent anyone
    [including the System Administrator] from reading the clear-text passwords,
    passwords are automatically generated, passwords are checked against a dictionary of
    disallowed passwords).


•   State the number of invalid access attempts that may occur for a given user identifier
    or access location (terminal or port) and describe the actions taken when that limit is
    exceeded.


•   Describe the procedures for verifying that all system-provided administrative default
    passwords have been changed.


•   Describe the procedures for limiting access scripts with embedded passwords (e.g.,
    scripts with embedded passwords are prohibited, scripts with embedded passwords
    are only allowed for batch applications).


•   Describe any policies that provide for bypassing user authentication requirements,
    single-sign-on technologies (e.g., host-to-host, authentication servers, user-to-host
    identifier, and group user identifiers) and any compensating controls.



•   If digital signatures are used, the technology must conforms with FIPS 1 86, Digital
    Signature Standard and FIPS 180-1, Secure Hash Standard issued by NIST, unless a
    waiver has been granted. Describe any use of digital or electronic signatures.
    Address the following specific issues:

    >   State the digital signature standards used. If the standards used are not NIST
        standards, please state the date the waiver was granted, and the name and title of
        the official granting the waiver.

    6.GSS.2 Logical Access Controls (Authorization/Access Controls)

Logical access controls are the system-based mechanisms used to specify who or what
(e.g., in the case of a process) is to have access to a specific system resource and the type

of access that is permitted.

In this section, discuss the controls in place to authorize or restrict the activities of users
and system personnel within the general support system. Describe hardware or software
features that are designed to permit only authorized access to or within the system, to
restrict users to authorized transactions and functions, and/or to detect unauthorized

activities (e.g., access control lists).   The following are areas that should be considered.

•     Describe formal policies that define the authority that will be granted to each user or
      class of users.   Indicate if these policies follow the concept of least privilege which
      requires identifying the user's job functions, determining the minimum set of
      privileges required to perform that function, and restricting the user to a domain with
      those privileges and nothing more. Include in the description the procedures for
      granting new users access and the procedures for when the role or job function
      changes.


•     Identify whether the policies include separation of duties enforcement to prevent an
      individual from having all necessary authority or information access to allow
      fraudulent activity without collusion.


•     Describe the system's capability to establish an Access Control List or register of the
      users, and the types of access they are permitted.


•     Indicate whether a manual Access Control List is maintained.


•     Indicate if the security software allows application owners to restrict the access rights
      of other application users, the general support system administrator, or operators to
      the application programs, data, or files.


•     Describe how application users are restricted from accessing the operating system,
      other applications, or other system resources not needed in the performance of their
      duties.


•     Indicate how often Access Control Lists are reviewed to identify and remove users
      who have left the organization or whose duties no longer require access to the
      application.

                                                         Plans for Information Technology Systems




•   Describe policy or logical access controls that regulate how users may delegate access
    permissions or make copies of files or information accessible to other users. This
    "discretionary access control" may be appropriate for some applications, and
    inappropriate for others.   Document any evaluation made to justify/support use of
    "discretionary access control."


•   Describe controls to detect unauthorized transaction attempts by authorized and/or
    unauthorized users.


•   hidicate after what period of user inactivity the system automatically blanks
    associated display screens and/or after what period of user inactivity the system
    automatically disconnects inactive users or requires the user to enter a unique
    password before reconnecting to the system or application.


•   Describe any restrictions to prevent users from accessing the system or applications
    outside of normal work hours or on weekends.       Discuss in-place restrictions.


•   Indicate if encryption is used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files as part
    of the system or application access control procedures.    (If encryption is used
    primarily for authentication, include this information in the section above.) If
    encryption is used as part of the access controls, provide information about the
    following:


    > What cryptographic methodology (e.g., secret key and public key) is used? If a
        specific off-the-shelf product is used, provide the name of the product. If the
        product and the implementation method meets federal standards (e.g.. Data
        Encryption Standard, Digital Signature Standard), include that information.


    >   Discuss cryptographic key management procedures for key generation,
        distribution, storage, entry, use, destruction, and archiving.


•   If the general support system is connected to the Internet or other wide area
    network(s), discuss what additional hardware or technical controls have been installed
    and implemented to provide protection against unauthorized system penetration and
    other known Internet threats and vulnerabilities.


•   Describe any type of secure gateway or firewall in use, including its configuration,
    (e.g., configured to restrict access to critical system resources and to disallow certain

    types of traffic to pass through to the system).


•   Provide information regarding any port protection devices used to require specific
    access authorization to the communication ports, including the configuration of the
    port protection devices and if additional passwords or tokens are required.

•   Identify whether internal security labels are used to control access to specific
    information types or files, and if such labels specify protective measures or indicate
    additional handling instructions.


•   Indicate if host-based authentication is used. (This is an access control approach that
    grants access based on the identity of the host originating the request, instead of the
    individual user requesting access.)


In addition, documentation for a system should include a standardized log-on banner.
Public Law 99-474 requires that a warning message be displayed, notifying unauthorized
users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and unauthorized use
can be punished by fines or imprisonment. Some of the systems now in use are intended
for unrestricted use by the general public (e.g., Internet-based systems used for
widespread public information dissemination), a situation not prevalent when Public Law
99-474 was enacted. Thus, due to their adverse impact on the intended user population,
highly restrictive warning banners may not be appropriate. The choice of which screen
warning barmer to implement is up to the system owner and should be based on system-
specific technology limitations, data sensitivity, or other unique system requirements. In
this section, describe the rationale for electing to use or not use warning banners and

provide an example of the banners used.Where appropriate, state whether the
Department of Justice, Computer Crime and Intellectual Properties Section, approved the
warning banner.

    6.GSS.3 Audit Trails

Audit trails maintain a record of system activity by system or application processes and
by user activity.   In conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit trails can
provide a means to help accomplish several security-related objectives, including
individual accountability, reconstruction of events, intrusion detection, and problem
identification. In this section, describe the audit trail mechanisms in place.      A list of
items to consider are provided below:


•     Does the audit trail provide accountability by providing a trace of user actions?

•     Can the audit trail support after-the-fact investigations of how, when, and why normal
      operations ceased?


•     Are audit trails designed and implemented to record appropriate information that can
      assist in intrusion detection?


•     Are audit trails used as online tools to help identify problems other than intrusions as
      they occur?


•     Does the audit trail include sufficient information to establish what events occurred
      and who (or what) caused them. In general, an event record should specify:

      > Type of event;

      > When the event occurred;

      >   User ID associated with the event; and

      > Program or command used to initiate the event.

•     Is access to online audit logs strictly controlled?



•     Is there separation of duties between security personnel    who administer the access
      control function and those who administer the audit trail?


•     Is the confidentiality of audit trail information protected if, for example, it records

      personal information about users?


•     Describe how frequently audit trails are reviewed and whether there are review

      guidelines.



•     Can the audit trail be queried by user ID, terminal ID, application name, date and
      time, or some other set of parameters to run reports of selected information.

                                                        Plans for Information Technology Systems




•   Does the appropriate system-level or application-level administrator review the audit
    trails following a   known system or application software problem, a known violation
    of existing requirements by a user, or some unexplained system or user problem?


•   Audit analysis tools, such as those based on audit reduction, attack signature, and
    variance techniques, can be used in a real-time, or near real-time, fashion. Does the
    organization use the many types of tools that have been developed to help reduce the
    amount of information contained in audit records, as well as to distill useful
    information from the raw data?


Keystroke monitoring is the process used to view or record both the keystrokes entered
by a computer user and the computer's response during an interactive session. Keystroke
monitoring is usually considered a special case of audit trails. The Department of Justice
has advised that an ambiguity in U.S. law makes it unclear whether keystroke monitoring
is considered equivalent to an unauthorized telephone wiretap.    If keystroke monitoring is
used in audit trails, organizations should have a written policy and notify users. The
Rules of Behavior may be one vehicle for distributing the information. If keystroke
monitoring is used, provide reference to the policy and the means of notification. Also
indicate whether the Department of Justice has reviewed the policy.

1 .   Introduction


The following rules of behavior are to be followed by all users of the HGA's Financial
Information System (HFIS). The rules clearly delineate responsibilities of and
expectations for all individuals with access to the HFIS. Non-compliance of these rules
will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of infraction. Actions
may range from a verbal or written warning, removal of system access for a specific
period of time, reassignment to other duties, or termination, depending on the severity of
the violation.




1 .    Responsibilities


The Chief, Financial Information Systems Branch, is responsible for ensuring an
adequate level of protection is afforded to the FIS, through an appropriate mix of
technical, administrative, and managerial controls. The Branch Chief develops policies
and procedures, ensures the development and presentation of user and contractor
awareness sessions, and inspects and spot checks to determine that an adequate level of
compliance with security requirements exists. The Branch Chief is responsible for
periodically conducting vulnerability analyses to help determine if security controls are
adequate. Special attention will be given to those new and developing technologies,
systems, and applications that can open or have opened vulnerabilities in HGA's security
posture.




2.    Other Policies and Procedures


The rules are not to be used in place of existing policy, rather they are intended to
enhance and further define the specific rules each user must follow while accessing HFIS.
The rules are consistent with the policy and procedures described in the following
directives:


HGA IRM Computer Security Handbook. The newly revised Handbook, dated April 4,
1998, contains computer security guidance on a wide range of topics, i.e., personnel
security, incident handling, access control mechanisms. This document contains
responsibilities for the SECURITY OFFICE,     HGA managers, and users.

                                                                           Major Application

HFIS Access Control Management Directive. This directive, dated May 6, 1997,
contains responsibilities for HFIS data owners and application administrators.


Draft HFIS Access Control Management Directive. The draft HFIS Access Control
Management Directive contains specific responsibilities for the security officer.



Letter for External (non-HGA) Users.  A letter for Non-HGA users which transmits the
applicable HGA policies should be provided to all non-HGA users while using HFIS, or
when using HGA systems and applications in general. These responsibilities should be
included in training HGA provides for agency security points of contact, and should be
included in interagency agreements or other formal agreements or documents between
HGA and other organizations.

3.   Application Rules


4.1 Work at home.     HGA Personnel Policy Directive 97-03, dated March 10, 1997,
authorizes Division Directors to designate specific employees (e.g., critical job series,
employees on maternity leave, employees with certain medical conditions) as eligible for
working at home. Any work-at-home arrangement should:


•    be in writing;


•    identify the time period the work at home will be allowed;


•    identify what government equipment and supplies will be needed by the employee at
     home, and how that equipment and supplies will be transferred and accounted for;

•    identify if telecommuting will be needed and allowed (this issue should be discussed
     between the requesting organization. Information Resources Management Division
     (IRMD), and the SECURITY OFFICE; see Section 4.2); and

•    be reviewed by HGA's personnel office prior to commencement.

4.2 Dial-in access.   The IRM Division Director may authorize dial-in access to HFIS.       It

                                                                   may become
is understood that dial-in access poses additional security risks, but

necessary for certain job functions. If dial-in access is allowed, IRMD and the security
office will regularly review telecommunications logs and     HGA phone records, and
conduct spot-checks to determine if HGA business functions are complying with controls
placed on the use of dial-in lines. A ll dial-in calls will use one-time passwords. If dial-in
access is allowed to other applications on the system on which HFIS resides, the
managers of those applications should also determine if such access could pose a risk to
HFIS data.

                                                                          Major Application

4.3 Connection to the Internet.    Some HGA personnel have access to the Internet. HGA
should ensure that the user authentication required for access is adequate to protect HFIS
programs and data.     If such access is allowed,   HGA should carefully document all
external connections to ensure access to HFIS is limited to controlled points of entry.


4.4 Protection of software copyright licenses. All copyright licenses associated with the
COTS HFIS software are complied with by HGA personnel, as well as by contractors
responsible for developing and maintaining HFIS.        HGA requires that all copyright
licenses for all PC-based and LAN-based software used by HFIS program persormel and
contractor persormel are understood and that these personnel comply with the license
requirements. End users, supervisors, and function managers are ultimately responsible
for this compliance.


4.5 Unofficial use of government equipment. Users should be aware that personal use of
information resources is not authorized.




Iacknowledge receipt of, understand my responsibilities, and will comply with the rules
of behavior for the HFIS.

                       Hypothetical Government Agency's (HGA)
                              Backbone Local Area Network

The rules of behavior contained in this document are to be followed by all users of the
HGA Local Area Network (LAN). Users will be held accountable for their actions on the
LAN. If an employee violates HGA policy regarding the rules of the LAN, they may be
subject to disciplinary action at the discretion of HGA management. Actions may range
from a verbal or written warning, removal of system access for a specific period of time,
reassignment to other duties, or termination, depending on the severity of the violation.


Work at home.     HGA Personnel Policy Directive 97-03, dated March 10, 1997,
authorizes Division Directors to designate specific employees (e.g., critical job series,
employees on maternity leave, employees with certain medical conditions) as eligible for
working at home.    Any work at home arrangement should:

•   be in vmting;


•   identify the time period the work at home will be allowed;


•   identify what government equipment and supplies will be needed by the employee at
    home, and how that equipment and supplies will be transferred and accounted for;

•   identify if telecommuting will be needed and allowed (this issue should be discussed
    between the requesting organization, Information Resources Management Division
    (IRMD), and the SECURITY OFFICE; see Dial-in access section below); and

•   be reviewed by HGA's personnel office prior to commencement.



Dial-in access. No dial-in access is used to access LAN servers. However, if a justifiable
need occurs, the IRM Division Director may authorize dial-in access to a LAN server. It
is understood that dial-in access would pose additional security risks, but may become
necessary for certain job functions. If dial-in access is allowed, IRMD and the
SECURITY OFFICE will regularly review telecommunications logs and HGA phone
records, and conduct spot-checks to determine if HGA business functions are complying
with controls placed on the use of dial-in lines. All dial-in calls will use one-time
passwords.


Connection to the Internet. Some HGA personnel have access to the Internet. Access to
the Internet should be closely controlled by the SECURITY OFFICE.        HGA divisions,
staff managers, and technicians should know that only HGA-authorized Internet

                                                                 General Support Systems


connections will be allowed, and that all connections must conform to HGA's security
and communications architecture.

Protection of copyright licenses (software) —
                                           LAN and PC users are not to download
LAN-resident software. Audit logs will be reviewed to determine whether employees
attempt to access LAN servers on which valuable, off-the-shelf software resides, but to
which users have not been granted access. Audit logs will also show users' use of a
"copy" command; this may indicate attempts to illegally download software.
Unauthorized copying of PC-based software is also prohibited.


Unofficial use of government equipment — Users should be aware that personal use of
information resources — LAN and PC - is not authorized.


Use of passwords — Users are to use passwords of a length specified by the LAN system
administrators — a mix of six (6) alpha and numeric characters, they are to keep
passwords confidential and are not to share passwords with anyone.


System privileges — Users are given access to the LAN based on a need to perform
specific work. Users are to work within the confines of the access allowed and are not to
attempt access to systems or applications to which access has not been authorized.


Individual accountability — Users will be held accountable for their actions on the LAN.
This is stressed during computer security awareness training sessions


Restoration of service — The availability of the LAN is a concern to all users. All users
are responsible for ensuring the restoration of services in the event the   LAN is
unoperational.


I   acknowledge receipt of, understand my responsibilities, and will comply with the rules
of behavior for the HGA Backbone LAN.

Glossary


Acceptable Risk is a concern that is acceptable to responsible management, due to the
cost and magnitude of implementing countermeasures.


Accreditation is synonymous with the term authorize processing. Accreditation is the
authorization and approval granted to a major application or general support system to
process in an operational environment.      It is   made on the basis of a certification by
designated technical personnel that the system meets pre-specified technical requirements
for achieving adequate system security. See also Authorize Processing, Certification
and Designated Approving Authority.

Authorize Processing occurs when management authorizes a system based on an
assessment of management, operational and technical controls.           By authorizing
processing in a system the management official accepts the risk associated with it. See
also Accreditation, Certification, and Designated Approving Authority.


Availability Protection requires backup of system and information, contingency plans,
disaster recovery plans, and redundancy.   Examples of systems and information requiring
availability protection are time-share systems, mission-critical applications, time and
attendance, financial, procurement, or life-critical.


Awareness, Training and Education includes (1) awareness programs set the stage for
training by changing organizational attitudes toward realization of the importance of
security and the adverse consequences of its failure; (2) the purpose of training is to teach
people the skills that will enable them to perform their jobs more effectively; and (3)
education is more in-depth than training and is targeted for security professionals and
those whose jobs require expertise in automated information security.


Certification is synonymous with the term authorize processing. Certification is the
technical evaluation that establishes the extent to which a computer system, application,
or network design and implementation meets a pre-specified set of security requirements.
See also {Accreditation) and {Authorize Processing.)


Confidentiality Protection requires access controls such as user ID/passwords, terminal
identifiers, restrictions on actions like read, write, delete, etc.   Examples of
confidentiality-protected information are personnel, financial, proprietary, trade secrets,
internal agency, investigations, other federal agency, national resources, national security,
and high or new technology under Executive Order or Act of Congress.

Designated Approving Authority (DAA) is the senior management official who has the
authority to authorize processing (accredit) an automated information (major application)
or (general support system) and accept the risk associated with the system.

General Support System is an interconnected information resource under the same direct
management control that shares common functionality.        It   normally includes hardware,
software, information, data, applications, communications, facilities, and people and
provides support for a variety of users and/or applications, hidividual applications
support different mission-related functions. Users may be from the same or different
organizations.


Individual Accountability requires individual users to be held accountable for their
actions after being notified of the rules of behavior in the use of the system and the
penalties associated with the violation of those rules.


Major Application is an application that requires special attention to security due to the
risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to
or modification of the information in the application.    A breach in a major application
might comprise many individual application programs and hardware, software, and
telecommunications components. Major applications can be either a major software
application or a combination of hardware/software where the only purpose of the system
is to support a specific mission-related   function.


Networks include communication capability that allows one user or system to cormect to
another user or system and can be part of a system or a separate system. Examples of
networks include local area network or wide area networks, including public networks
such as the Internet.


Operational Controls address security methods that focus on mechanisms that primarily
are implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems).


Risk is the possibility of harm or loss to any software, information, hardware,
administrative, physical, communications, or persoimel resource within an automated
information system or activity.


Risk Management is the ongoing process of assessing the risk to automated information
resources and information, as part of a risk-based approach used to determine adequate
security for a system by analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities and selecting
appropriate cost-effective controls to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of risk.


Rules of Behavior are the rules that have been established and implemented concerning
use of, security in, and acceptable level of risk for the system. Rules will clearly delineate
responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the system. Rules
should cover such matters as work at home, dial-in access, connection to the Internet, use
of copyrighted works, unofficial use of federal government equipment, the assignment
and limitation of system privileges, and individual accountability.

Sensitive Information refers to information that requires protection due to the risk and
magnitude of loss or harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure,
alteration, or destruction of the information. The term includes information whose

                                                                                  Appendix D -
                                                                                      Glossary


improper use or disclosure could adversely affect the ability of an agency to accomplish
its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals requiring protection under

the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act.


Sensitivity in an information technology environment consists of the system, data, and
applications which must be examined individually and in total. All systems and
applications require some level of protection for confidentiality, integrity, and availability
which is determined by an evaluation of the sensitivity and criticality of the information
processed, the relationship of the system to the organizations mission, and the economic
value of the system components.


System is a generic term used for briefness to mean either a major application or a
general support system.


System Operational Status is either (a) Operational - system is currently in operation, (b)
Under Development - system is currently under design, development, or implementation,
or (c) Undergoing a Major Modification - system is currently undergoing a major
conversion or transition.


Technical Controls consist of hardware and software controls used to provide automated
protection to the system or applications. Technical controls operate within the technical
system and applications.


Threat is an activity, deliberate or unintentional, with the potential for causing harm to an
automated information system or activity.


Vulnerability is a flaw or weakness that may allow harm to occur to an automated
information system or activity.

Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reports NIST research
and development in those disciplines of the physical and engineering sciences in which the Institute is
active. These include physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences. Papers cover a
broad range of subjects, with major emphasis on measurement methodology and the basic technology
underlying standardization. Also included from time to time are survey articles on topics closely related to
the Institute's technical and scientific programs. Issued six times a year.

National Standard Reference Data Series Provides quantitative data on the physical and chemical
properties of materials, compiled from the world's literature and critically evaluated. Developed under a
worldwide program coordinated by NIST under the authority of the National Standard Data Act (Public
Law 90-396). NOTE: The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data (JPCRD) is published
bimonthly for NIST by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP).
Subscriptions, reprints, and supplements are available from ACS, 1155 Sixteenth St., NW, Washington, DC
20056.
                           —
Building Science Series Disseminates technical information developed at the Institute on building
materials, components, systems, and whole structures. The series presents research results, test methods, and
performance criteria related to the structural and environmental functions and the durability and safety
characteristics of building elements and systems.

Technical Notes   —Studies or    reports which are complete in themselves but restrictive in their treatment of
a subject. Analogous to monographs but not so comprehensive in scope or definitive in treatment of the
subject area. Often serve as a vehicle for final reports of work performed at NIST under the sponsorship of
other government agencies.
                                  —
Voluntary Product Standards Developed under procedures published by the Department of Commerce
in Part 10, Tide 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standards establish nationally recognized
requirements for products, and provide all concerned interests with a basis for common understanding of
the characteristics of the products. NIST administers this program in support of the efforts of private-sector
standardizing organizations.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB) Publications in this series
collectively constitute die Federal Information Processing Standards Register. The Register serves as the
official source of information in the Federal Government regarding standards issued by NIST pursuant to
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended, Public Law 89-306 (79 Stat.
1127), and as implemented by Executive Order 11717 (38 FR 12315, dated May 11, 1973) and Part 6 of
Title 15CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).
NIST Interagency or Internal Reports (NISTIR)          —   ^The series includes interim or final reports on work
performed by NI^ for outside sponsors (bodi government and nongovernment). In general, initial
distribution is handled by the sponsor; public distribution is handled by sales through the National Technical
Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161, in hard copy, electronic media, or microfiche form. NISTIR's
may also report results of NIST projects of transitory or limited interest, including tiiose that will be
published subsequently in more comprehensive form.
