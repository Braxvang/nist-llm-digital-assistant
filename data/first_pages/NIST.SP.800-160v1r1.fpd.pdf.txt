40                                                  ABSTRACT
41   This publication provides a basis for establishing a discipline for systems security engineering (SSE)
42   as part of systems engineering and does so in terms of its principles, concepts, activities, and tasks.
43   The publication also demonstrates how those SSE principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be
44   effectively applied to systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security
45   for any system, regardless of its purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or stage of its system life
46   cycle. Ultimately, the intent of the material is to advance the field of SSE as a discipline that can
47   be applied and studied and to serve as a basis for the development of educational and training
48   programs, including the development of professional certifications and other assessment criteria.

 73                                                  NOTE TO REVIEWERS
 74   The final public draft of SP 800-160. Volume 1, Revision 1 offers some significant content and
 75   design changes that include a renewed emphasis on the importance of systems engineering and
 76   viewing systems security engineering as a critical subdiscipline necessary to achieve trustworthy
 77   secure systems. This perspective treats security as an emergent property of a system. It requires
 78   a disciplined, rigorous engineering process to deliver the security capabilities necessary to protect
 79   stakeholders’ assets from loss while achieving mission and business success.

 80   Bringing security out of its traditional stovepipe and viewing it as an emergent system property
 81   helps to ensure that only authorized behaviors and outcomes occur, much like the engineering
 82   processes that address safety, reliability, availability, and maintainability in building spacecraft,
 83   airplanes, and bridges. Treating security as a subdiscipline of systems engineering also facilitates
 84   making comprehensive trade space decisions as stakeholders continually address cost, schedule,
 85   and performance issues and the uncertainties associated with system development efforts.

 86   The authors spent a significant amount of time analyzing the comments from a variety of public-
 87   and private-sector entities. Many of the comments helped shape the direction of the publication
 88   and the specific content and design changes that were undertaken. In particular, the final public
 89   draft:
 90        •     Provides a renewed focus on the design principles and concepts needed for engineering
 91              trustworthy secure systems, distributing the content across several redesigned initial
 92              chapters
 93        •     Relocates the detailed system life cycle processes and security considerations to separate
 94              appendices for ease of use
 95        •     Streamlines the design principles for trustworthy secure systems by eliminating the two
 96              previous design principle categories
 97        •     Includes a new introduction to the [ISO 15288] system life cycle processes and describes
 98              key relationships among those processes
 99        •     Clarifies key systems engineering and systems security engineering terminology
100        •     Simplifies the structure of the system life cycle processes, activities, tasks, and references
101        •     Provides additional references to international standards and technical guidance to
102              better support the security aspects of the systems engineering process

103   Thank you for taking the time to review the final draft of this publication. We appreciate your

109                                              CALL FOR PATENT CLAIMS
110   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
111   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication).
112   Such guidance and/or requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference
113   to another publication. This call includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
114   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant
115   unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

116   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
117   in written or electronic form, either:
118        a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
119           and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
120        b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
121           applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
122           or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
123              i)   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
124                   discrimination; or
125              ii) without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
126                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

127   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
128   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
129   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
130   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event
131   of future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
132
133   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
134   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

135   Such statements should be addressed to: security-engineering@nist.gov.

252       “Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is in itself a system design problem. A
253       combination of hardware, software, communications, physical, personnel and administrative-
254       procedural safeguards is required for comprehensive security. In particular, software safeguards
255       alone are not sufficient.”

262       “In the past, it has been assumed that to show that a system is safe, it is sufficient to provide
263       assurance that the process for identifying the hazards has been as comprehensive as possible, and
264       that each identified hazard has one or more associated controls. While historically this approach has
265       been used reasonably effectively to ensure that known risks are controlled, it has become increasingly
266       apparent that evolution to a more holistic approach is needed as systems become more complex and
267       the cost of designing, building, and operating them become more of an issue.”

274      “Cybersecurity requires more than government action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber
275      actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector. The private sector must

277      securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace.”
278      “Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal Government

289                                                  FOREWORD
290   On May 12, 2021, the President signed an Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation’s
291   Cybersecurity [EO 14028]. The Executive Order stated—
292       “The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that
293       threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people's security and
294       privacy. The Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect,
295       and respond to these actions and actors.”

296   The Executive Order further described the holistic nature of the cybersecurity challenges
297   confronting the Nation with computing technology embedded in every type of system from
298   general-purpose computing systems supporting businesses to cyber-physical systems controlling
299   the operations in power plants that provide electricity to the American people. The Federal
300   Government must bring to bear the full scope of its authorities and resources to protect and
301   secure its computer systems, whether the systems are cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid. The
302   scope of protection and security must include systems that process data (information technology
303   [IT]) and those that run the vital machinery that ensures our safety (operational technology [OT]).

304   In response to the EO, there is a need to:
305   •    Identify stakeholder assets and protection needs
306   •    Provide protection commensurate with the criticality of stakeholder assets, needs, and the
307        consequences of asset loss, and correlated with the modern threat and adversary capability
308   •    Develop scenarios and model the complexity of systems to provide a rigorous basis to reason
309        about, manage, and address the uncertainty associated with that complexity
310   •    Adopt an engineering-based approach that addresses the principles of trustworthy secure
311        design and apply those principles throughout the system life cycle

312   Building trustworthy, secure systems cannot occur in a vacuum with stovepipes for cyberspace,
313   software, hardware, and information technology. Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach
314   to protection, a determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of
315   adversity, including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. As such, this publication
316   addresses considerations for the engineering-driven actions necessary to develop defensible and
317   survivable systems, including the components that compose and the services that depend on
318   those systems. The overall objective is to address security issues from a stakeholder requirements
319   and protection needs perspective and to use established engineering processes to ensure that
320   such requirements and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire
321   life cycle of the system.

322   Engineering trustworthy, secure systems is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial
323   investment in the requirements, architecture, and design of systems, components, applications,
324   and networks. A trustworthy system is a system that provides compelling evidence to support
325   claims that it meets its requirements to deliver the protection and performance needed by
326   stakeholders. Introducing a disciplined, structured, and standards-based set of systems security
327   engineering activities and tasks provides an important starting point and forcing function to
328   initiate needed change.

                   SECURITY – AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF AN ENGINEERING PROCESS
            A system is engineered to achieve a capability driven by stakeholder mission and business needs.
            Security is an emergent property of a system that is achieved through a principled engineering
            process that reflects the stakeholder’s protection needs and concerns. The engineered security
            capability contributes to the overall system capability that satisfies the stakeholder mission and
            business needs.
            No system can provide absolute security due to the limits of human certainty, the uncertainty
            that exists in the life cycle of every system, and the constraints of cost, schedule, performance,
            feasibility, and practicality. As such, trade-offs made routinely across contradictory, competing,
            and conflicting needs and constraints are optimized to achieve adequate security, which reflects
            a decision made by stakeholders.

                                       THE POWER OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
            When crossing a bridge, we have a reasonable expectation that the bridge will not collapse and
            will get us to our destination without incident. For bridge builders, the focus is on equilibrium,
            static and dynamic loads, vibrations, and resonance. The science of physics combines with civil
            engineering principles and concepts to produce a product that we deem trustworthy, giving us a
            level of confidence that the bridge is fit-for-purpose.
            For system developers, there are also fundamental principles and concepts that can be found in
            mathematics, computer science, computer and electrical engineering, systems engineering, and
            software engineering that when properly employed, provide the necessary trustworthiness to
            engender that same level of confidence. Trustworthy secure systems are achieved by making a
            significant and substantial investment in strengthening the underlying systems and system
            components by employing transdisciplinary systems engineering efforts guided and informed by
            well-defined security requirements and secure architectures and designs. Such efforts have been
            proven over time to produce sound engineering-based solutions to complex and challenging
            systems security problems. Only under those circumstances can we build systems that are
            adequately secure and exhibit a level of trustworthiness that is sufficient for the purpose for
            which the system was built.
            This publication does not focus exclusively on cybersecurity but rather addresses security more
            broadly. Given the scope of this publication, the following observations are relevant and worth
            noting:
                “For the first few decades as a burgeoning discipline, cybersecurity has been dominated by
                the development of widgets to address some aspect of the problem. Systems have become
                increasingly complex and interconnected, creating even more attack opportunities, which
                in turn creates even more opportunities to create defensive widgets that will bring some
                value in detecting or preventing an aspect of the attack space. Eventually, this becomes a
                game of whack-a-mole in which a simulated mole pops up from one of many holes and the
                objective is to whack the mole before it pops back in its hole. The moles represent new
                attacks, and the holes represent a huge array of potential vulnerabilities – both known and
                as-yet-undiscovered.”
                “Underlying [the discipline of] engineering is science. Sometimes engineering gets ahead of
                science, such as in bridge building, where the fundamentals of material science were not
                well understood. Many bridges were built; many fell down; some stayed up; designs of the
                ones that stayed up were copied. Eventually, for engineering to advance beyond some point,
                science must catch up with engineering. The science underlying cybersecurity [and more
                generally, security] engineering is complex and difficult. On the other hand, there is no time
                like the present to start, because it is both urgent and important to the future…”

334   CHAPTER ONE

335   INTRODUCTION
336   THE NEED FOR SYSTEMS ENGINEERING-BASED TRUSTWORTHY SECURE SYSTEMS

337   Today’s systems 1 are inherently complex reflecting a growth in the size, number, and types of
338   components and technologies 2 that compose those systems. There is also a dependence on
339   systems resulting in a range of consequences from inconvenience to catastrophic loss due to
340   adversity 3 within the operating environment. Managing the complexity of systems and being able
341   to claim that those systems are trustworthy secure means that, first and foremost, there must be
342   a level of confidence in the feasibility, correctness-in-concept, philosophy, and design regarding
343   the ability of a system to produce only the intended behaviors and outcomes. That basis provides
344   the foundation to address stakeholder protection needs and security concerns with sufficient
345   confidence that the system functions only as intended while subjected to a spectrum of adversity
346   and to realistically bound those expectations with respect to constraints and uncertainty. The
347   failure to address complexity and security will continue to leave the Nation susceptible to the
348   consequences of adversity with the potential for causing serious, severe, or even catastrophic
349   consequences.

350   Security is freedom from the conditions that can cause a loss of assets with unacceptable
351   consequences. 4 Stakeholders must define the scope of security in terms of the assets to which
352   security applies and the consequences against which security is assessed. 5 Systems engineering
353   provides a necessary foundation for a disciplined and structured approach to building assured,
354   trustworthy secure systems. Trustworthiness 6 is defined in [Neumann04] as follows:
355       By trustworthiness, we mean simply worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever critical requirements
356       may be needed for a particular component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission,
357       enterprise, or other entity. Trustworthiness requirements might typically involve (for example)
358       attributes of security, reliability, performance, and survivability under a wide range of potential
359       adversities. Measures of trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are

      do not [INCOSE19]. The elements that compose a system include hardware, software, data, humans, processes,
      procedures, facilities, materials, and naturally occurring entities [ISO 15288]. See Section 2.1.
      2 The term technology is used in the broadest context in this publication to include computing, communications, and

      information technologies, as well as any mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or structural components in systems that
      contain or are enabled by such technologies. This view of technology provides an increased recognition of the digital,
      computational, and electronic machine-based foundation of modern complex systems and the growing importance of
      an assured trustworthiness of that foundation in providing the system’s functional capability and explicit interaction
      with its physical machine and human system elements.
      3 The term adversity refers to those conditions that can cause a loss of assets (e.g., threats, attacks, vulnerabilities,

      hazards, disruptions, and exposures).
      4 The phrasing used in this definition of security is intentional. [Anderson20] noted that “now that everything’s acquiring

      connectivity, you can’t have safety without security, and these ecosystems are emerging.” Reflecting this observation,
      the security definition was chosen to achieve alignment with a prevailing safety definition.
      5 Adapted from [NASA11].

      6 Trustworthiness is not only about demonstrably meeting a set of requirements, but the requirements must also be

      complete, consistent, and correct. From a security perspective, a trustworthy system is a system that meets a set of
      well-defined requirements including security requirements.

361   Systems security engineering, as a systems engineering subdiscipline, addresses security-relevant
362   considerations intended to produce security outcomes. The engineering efforts are conducted at
363   the appropriate level of fidelity and rigor needed to achieve trustworthiness and assurance
364   objectives. Systems security engineering provides the complementary engineering capability that
365   extends the concept of trustworthiness to deliver trustworthy secure systems. Trustworthy
366   secure systems, through evidence and expert judgment, are deemed to be capable of limiting and
367   preventing the effects of modern adversities. Such adversities come in malicious and non-
368   malicious forms and can emanate from a variety of sources including physical and electronic.
369   Adversities can include attacks from determined and capable adversaries, human errors of
370   omission and commission, accidents and incidents, component faults and failures, abuses and
371   misuses, and natural and human-made disasters.
372

           “Security is embedded in systems. Rather than two engineering groups designing two systems, one
           intended to protect the other, systems engineering specifies and designs a single system with
           security embedded in the system and its components.”

375   1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
376   The purpose of this publication is:
377   •    To provide a basis to establish a discipline for systems security engineering, as part of systems
378        engineering, in terms of its principles, concepts, activities, and tasks
379   •    To foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless of its purpose, type,
380        scope, size, complexity, or stage of the system life cycle
381   •    To demonstrate how selected systems security engineering principles, concepts, activities,
382        and tasks can be effectively applied to systems engineering activities
383   •    To advance the field of systems security engineering as a discipline that can be applied and
384        studied
385   •    To serve as a basis for the development of educational and training programs, including the
386        development of individual certifications and other professional assessment criteria

387   The considerations set forth in this publication are applicable to all federal systems other than
388   those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. 7
389   These considerations have been broadly developed from a technical and technical management
390   perspective to complement similar considerations for national security systems and may be used
391   for such systems with the approval of federal officials exercising policy authority over such
392   systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector entities, are encouraged to
393   consider using the material in this publication, as appropriate.

      7 [OMB M-19-03] states that increasing the trustworthiness of systems is a significant undertaking that requires a

      substantial investment in the requirements, architecture, design, and development of systems, system components,
      applications, and networks. The policy requires federal agencies to implement the systems security engineering
      principles, concepts, techniques, and system life cycle processes in this publication for all high value assets (HVA).

394   The applicability statement is not meant to limit the technical and management application of
395   these considerations. That is, the security design principles, concepts, and techniques described
396   in this publication are part of a trustworthy secure design approach as described in Appendix D
397   and can be applied to any type of system, including:
398   •    New Systems
399        The engineering effort includes such activities as concept exploration, preliminary or applied
400        research to refine the concepts and/or feasibility of technologies employed in a new system,
401        and an assessment of alternative solutions. This effort is initiated during the concept and
402        development stages of the system life cycle.
403   •    Dedicated or Special-Purpose Systems
404        - Security-dedicated or security-purposed systems: The engineering effort delivers a system
405           that satisfies a security-dedicated need or provides a security-oriented purpose and does
406           so as a stand-alone system that may monitor or interact with other systems. Such systems
407           can include surveillance systems, physical protection systems, monitoring systems, and
408           security service provisioning systems.
409        -     High-confidence, dedicated-purpose systems: The engineering effort delivers a system
410              that satisfies the need for real-time control of vehicles, industrial or utility processes,
411              weapons, nuclear power plants, and other special-purpose needs. Such systems may
412              include multiple operational states or modes with varying forms of manual, semi-manual,
413              automated, or autonomous modes. These systems have highly deterministic properties,
414              strict timing constraints, functional interlocks, and severe or catastrophic consequences
415              of failure.
416   •    System of Systems
417        The engineering effort occurs across a set of constituent systems, each system with its own
418        stakeholders, primary purpose, and planned evolution. The composition of the constituent
419        systems into a system of systems [Maier98] produces a capability that would otherwise be
420        difficult or impractical to achieve. This effort can occur across a variety of system of systems
421        from a relatively informal, unplanned system of systems concept and evolution that emerges
422        over time via voluntary participation to a more formal execution with the most formal being
423        a system of systems concept that is directed, structured, and planned, and achieved via a
424        centrally managed engineering effort. Any resulting emergent behavior often introduces
425        opportunities and additional challenges for systems security engineering.

426   The design principles, concepts, and techniques can also be applied at any stage in the system life
427   cycle when an engineered approach is needed to achieve any of the following objectives:
428   •    System Modifications
429        - Reactive modifications to fielded systems: The engineering effort occurs in response to
430            adversity that diminishes or prevents the system from achieving the design intent. This
431            effort can occur during the production, utilization, or support stages of the system life
432            cycle and may be performed concurrently with or independent of day-to-day system
433            operations.
434        -     Planned upgrades to fielded systems while continuing to sustain day-to-day operations:
435              The planned system upgrades may enhance an existing system capability, provide a new

436              capability, or constitute a technology refresh of an existing capability. This effort occurs
437              during the production, utilization, or support stages of the system life cycle.
438        -     Planned upgrades to fielded systems that result in new systems: The engineering effort is
439              conducted as if developing a new system with a system life cycle that is distinct from the
440              life cycle of a fielded system. The upgrades are performed in a development environment
441              that is independent of the fielded system.
442   •    System Evolution
443        The engineering effort involves migrating or adapting a system or system implementation
444        from one operational environment or set of operating conditions to another operational
445        environment or set of operating conditions. 8
446   •    System Retirement
447        The engineering effort removes system functions or services and system elements from
448        operation, including removal of the entire system, and may also include the transition of
449        system functions and services to another system. The effort occurs during the retirement
450        stage of the system life cycle and may be conducted while sustaining day-to-day operations.

451   1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
452   This publication is intended for systems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering
453   professionals. The term systems security engineer is used to include systems engineers and
454   security professionals who apply the concepts and principles and perform the activities and tasks
455   described in this publication. 9 This publication can also be used by professionals who perform
456   other system life cycle activities or tasks. These include:
457   •    Individuals with security governance, risk management, and oversight responsibilities
458   •    Individuals with security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment,
459        inspection, and monitoring responsibilities
460   •    Individuals with acquisition, budgeting, and project management responsibilities
461   •    Individuals with system security administration, operations, maintenance, sustainment,
462        logistics, and support responsibilities
463   •    Providers of technology-related products, systems, or services
464   •    Educators in academic institutions offering systems engineering, computer engineering,
465        computer science, software engineering, and computer security programs




      8 Increasingly, there is a need to reuse or leverage system implementation successes within operational environments

      that are different from how they were originally designed and developed. This type of reuse or reimplementation of
      systems within other operational environments is more efficient and represents potential advantages in maximizing
      interoperability between various system implementations. It should be noted that reuse may violate the assumptions
      used to determine a system or system component was trustworthy.
      9 Systems security engineering activities and tasks can be applied to a mechanism, component, system element, system,

      system of systems, processes, or organizations. Regardless of the size or complexity of the entity, there is need for a
      transdisciplinary systems engineering team to deliver systems that are trustworthy and that satisfy the protection needs
      and concerns of stakeholders. The processes are intended to be tailored to facilitate effectiveness.

468   engineering specialties, architects, designers, and any individuals involved in the development of
469   trustworthy secure systems and system components. It is meant to be flexible in its application to
470   meet the diverse needs of organizations. There is no expectation that all of the technical content
471   in this publication will be used as part of a systems engineering effort. Rather, the concepts and
472   principles for trustworthy secure design in Appendices D through F as well as the systems life cycle
473   processes and security-relevant activities and tasks in Appendices G through K can be selectively
474   employed by organizations – relying on the experience and expertise of the engineering teams to
475   determine what is correct for their purpose. Applying the content of this publication provides an
476   approach for achieving the security outcomes of a systems engineering perspective on system life
477   cycle processes with the ultimate objective of improving the security and trustworthiness of
478   systems and system components.

479   The system life cycle processes described in this publication can take advantage of any system or
480   software development methodology. It is equally applicable to waterfall, spiral, DevOps, and agile
481   approaches in addition to other approaches. The processes can be applied recursively, iteratively,
482   concurrently, sequentially, or in parallel and to any system regardless of its size, complexity,
483   purpose, scope, environment of operation, or special nature. The full extent of the application of
484   the content in this publication is guided and informed by stakeholder capability needs, protection
485   needs, and concerns with particular attention paid to considerations of cost, schedule, and
486   performance.

                                              ENGINEERING-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS
               The effectiveness of any engineering discipline first requires a thorough understanding of the
               problem and consideration of all feasible solutions before acting to solve the identified problem.
               To maximize the effectiveness of systems security engineering, the security requirements for the
               protection against asset loss must be driven by business, mission, and all other stakeholder asset
               loss concerns. The security requirements are defined and managed as a well-defined set of
               engineering requirements and cannot be addressed independently or after the fact.
               In the context of systems security engineering, the term protection has a broad scope and is
               primarily focused on the concept of assets and asset loss. The protection capability provided by
               a system goes beyond prevention and aims to control the events, conditions, and consequences
               that constitute asset loss. It is achieved in the form of the specific capability and constraints on
               system architecture, design, function, implementation, construction, selection of technology,
               methods, and tools and must be “engineered in” as part of the system life cycle process.
               Understanding stakeholder asset protection needs (including assets that they own and assets
               that they do not own but must protect) and expressing those needs through a set of well-defined
               security requirements is an investment in the organization’s mission and business success in the
               modern age of global commerce, powerful computing systems, and network connectivity.

516   CHAPTER TWO

517   SYSTEMS ENGINEERING OVERVIEW
518   THE CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

519   This chapter presents system, systems engineering, trust, and trustworthiness concepts that
520   provide the foundation for engineering trustworthy secure systems.

521   2.1 SYSTEM CONCEPTS
522   Many system concepts are important to inform engineering trustworthy secure systems. This
523   includes what constitutes a system, the structure of a system, categories of systems, and the
524   concept of a system of systems.

525   2.1.1 Systems and System Structure
526   A system 10 is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit a behavior or meaning
527   that the individual constituents do not. The properties of a system (i.e., attributes, qualities, or
528   characteristics) emerge from the system’s parts or elements and their individual properties, as
529   well as the relationships and interactions between and among the parts or elements, the system,
530   and its environment [INCOSE19]. An engineered system is a system designed or adapted to
531   interact with an anticipated operational environment to achieve one or more intended purposes
532   while complying with applicable constraints [INCOSE19]. Figure 1 shows the basic structure of a
533   system including its constituent system elements. 11 12
534

                A system is an arrangement                                                …exhibit a behavior or
                 of parts or elements that                  SYSTEM                      meaning that the individual
                         together…                                                         constituents do not.




                      SYSTEM ELEMENT                   SYSTEM ELEMENT                     SYSTEM ELEMENT

535
536                               FIGURE 1: BASIC SYSTEM AND SYSTEM ELEMENT RELATIONSHIP

      10 Examples of systems include information systems, communications systems, financial systems, manufacturing

      systems, transportation systems, logistics systems, medical systems, weapons systems, mechanical systems, space
      systems, industrial control systems (ICS), Building Management and Building Automation Systems (BMS)/(BAS), optical
      systems, or electrical systems. Systems may be physical or conceptual; use information technology (IT) or operational
      technology (OT); include humans; be cyber-physical; and leverage Internet of Things (IoT) or other technologies.
      11 A system element can be a discrete component, product, service, subsystem, system, human, organization,

      infrastructure, or enterprise. System elements are implemented by hardware, software, and firmware that perform
      operations on information or data; physical structures, devices, and components in the environment of operation; and
      the people, processes, and procedures for operating, sustaining, and supporting the system elements.
      12 Systems with few or no active functions (e.g., physical infrastructure) may also exhibit assured trustworthiness. For

      example, the interstate highway system employs safety barriers such as Jersey walls (a system element) that contribute
      to the transportation system’s trustworthiness.




      CHAPTER TWO                                                                                                      PAGE 7

537   The purpose of a system is to deliver a capability. The capability may directly or indirectly interact
538   with, control, or monitor physical, mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic devices or other systems
539   or capabilities, or it may provide the ability to create, manipulate, access, transmit, store, or share
540   resources, such as data and information.

541   Figure 2 is a general model for the representation of a hierarchical system. Not all systems, such
542   as networks, are hierarchical in nature. Non-hierarchical systems have models that more
543   accurately reflect the relationships of their constituent elements. A system element may itself be
544   considered a system (i.e., comprised of other system elements). Realizing a system of interest
545   involves recursively resolving its structure to the point where understandable and manageable
546   system elements can be implemented (i.e., developed, bought, or reused) and subsequently
547   integrating those elements into the system.

551   A system of systems is a set of systems and system elements interacting to provide a unique
552   capability that none of the constituent systems can accomplish on its own. The elements of a
553   system of systems are, by definition, systems themselves. A system of systems consists of several
554   constituent systems plus any inter-system infrastructure, facilities, and processes necessary to
555   enable the constituent systems to integrate or interoperate [ISO 21841].

556   2.1.2 Interfacing, Enabling, and Interoperating Systems
557   Interfacing systems are systems that interact with the system of interest. Interfacing systems have
558   an interface for exchanging data, energy, or other resources with the system of interest. An
559   interfacing system exchanges resources with the system of interest during one or more system
560   life cycle stages, such as a system that interfaces for maintenance purposes or a system used to
561   develop the system of interest. The relationships with interfacing systems can be either bi-
562   directional or one way. Interfacing systems have two specific subsets: enabling systems and
563   interoperating systems.

574   2.2 SYSTEMS ENGINEERING FOUNDATIONS
575   Systems engineering is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enabling the successful
576   realization, use, and retirement of engineered systems. It employs systems principles and
577   concepts, as well as scientific, technological, and management methods to achieve such systems
578   [INCOSE]. Systems engineering is system-holistic in nature, whereby the contributions across
579   multiple engineering and specialty disciplines are evaluated and balanced to produce a coherent
580   system capability. Systems engineering applies systems science and systems thinking 13 to solve
581   problems and balances the often-conflicting needs, priorities, and constraints of performance,

      13 Systems science is an interdisciplinary field that studies complex systems in nature, society, and science. It aims to

      develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as social sciences, engineering,
      biology, and medicine. Systems thinking is a discipline of examining wholes, interrelationships, and patterns [SEBoK].

582   cost, schedule, and effectiveness to optimize the objectives for the solution with an acceptable
583   level of uncertainty. Systems engineering is outcome-oriented and leverages engineering
584   processes to realize a system while effectively managing complexity and serving as the principal
585   integrating mechanism for the technical, management, and support activities related to the
586   engineering effort. Finally, systems engineering is data- and analytics-driven to ensure that all
587   decisions and trades are guided and informed by data produced by analyses conducted with an
588   appropriate level of fidelity and rigor.

589   Systems engineering efforts are complex, requiring close coordination between the engineering
590   team and stakeholders throughout the system life cycle stages. 14 While systems engineering is
591   typically considered in terms of its developmental role as part of capability acquisition, systems
592   engineering efforts and responsibilities do not end once a system completes development and is
593   transitioned to the environment of operation for day-to-day operational use. Stakeholders
594   responsible for the system’s utilization, support, and retirement provide data to the systems
595   engineering team on an ongoing basis. This data captures experiences, problems, and issues
596   associated with system operation, maintenance, and sustainment. Stakeholders also advise on
597   enhancements and improvements made or desired. In addition, field engineering (also known as
598   sustainment engineering) provides on-site, full system life cycle engineering support for
599   operations, maintenance, and sustainment organizations. Field engineering teams coexist with or
600   are dispatched to operational sites and maintenance depots to provide continuous systems
601   engineering support.

602   Systems engineering efforts are system specific and context dependent in application. The context
603   includes stakeholders, operating environment, system purpose, and the relationships of the
604   system to other systems, its users, and the owning organization. Systems engineering is
605   concerned with defining and combining a system’s multiple subsystems of various physical and
606   logic types to accomplish the system purpose. This necessitates the integration of relevant
607   engineering and science disciplines in a transdisciplinary role. Systems engineering influences and
608   is influenced by organizational structure, budget, schedule, government/corporate/company
609   policy, regulations, law, and culture. Therefore, every project has constraints beyond the physical,
610   logical, and environmental contexts of the system of interest. Additionally, the system design
611   choices may influence all these factors (e.g., government policy and law may be based on the
612   understanding of legislators on which systems can achieve intent).

613   There are many additional resources available that provide a more in-depth examination of
614   systems engineering. 15 16 Such discussions are beyond the scope of this publication.


      14 Nomenclature for stages of the system life cycle varies but often includes concept analysis; solution analysis;

      technology maturation; system design and development; engineering and manufacturing development; production and
      deployment; training, operations, and support; and retirement and disposal.
      15 The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) is a not-for-profit organization founded to promote

      systems engineering and connect its practitioners. INCOSE offers a systems engineering handbook [INCOSE14] and
      Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge [SEBoK] as general resources, periodicals such as INCOSE INSIGHT, and other
      resources through their website (www.incose.org). These resources address specific processes and practices within
      systems engineering, many referenced within this publication.
      16 The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) has published a significant amount of material on

      systems engineering as it is applied to the NASA community. Publications include the NASA Systems Engineering
      Handbook [NASA07] and two volumes of expanded guidance. Volume 1 discusses systems engineering practices
      [NASA16]. Volume 2 addresses crosscutting and special topics [NASA18].

                                     CRITICAL SYSTEM BEHAVIORS OF THE FUTURE
            “To deliver system behavior, the systems engineer must define a group of subsystems and
            precisely how those subsystems are to interact with each other. It is the subsystems and their
            interactions which produce the system-level behavior. Many of us recognize a vehicle that can
            take a 60-degree curve at 200 miles per hour as possessing a valuable system behavior. Would
            we as quickly recognize safe, private, trusted, and available as system behaviors? These
            behaviors require the same careful system-level design and trades to achieve optimal solutions
            as the performance system behavior I mentioned above. And there is a clear need — investors
            want the system to keep their data private, to be safe, and to be trustworthy so that their control
            is not compromised by a cyber threat, and to be highly available.
            If we systems engineers are willing to recognize these behaviors as system behaviors, then we
            are accountable for delivering them as part of our job. If we choose to view these behaviors as
            attributes of the parts of our system but not the system as a whole, then we are likely to consider
            them as jobs for the “specialty engineers.” I’ve looked back into past behaviors of our system
            engineering community. What I find are examples of systems engineers giving our “specialty
            engineering” colleagues these challenges by way of the requirements-allocation process. I think
            we have been wrong to do this. Our “specialty” colleagues are likely to take these allocated
            requirements and focus on building safe, private, trusted, available parts of a system—rather
            than in delivering safe, private, trusted, and available system behaviors. It is true you can build
            a safer system by building safe parts. However, you can’t build a truly safe system without having
            safe parts interacting with each other in a safe manner. The same can be said for other system
            behaviors (private, trusted, available, and so on).” [INCOSE13]

618   2.3 TRUST AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
619   The concepts of trust and trustworthiness are foundational to engineering trustworthy secure
620   systems, to the decisions made to grant trust, and to the extent which trust is granted based on
621   demonstrated trustworthiness. Trust is a belief that an entity meets certain expectations, and
622   therefore, can be relied upon. The terms belief and can imply that trust may be granted to an
623   entity whether the entity is trustworthy or not. A trustworthy entity is one for which sufficient
624   evidence exists to support its claimed trustworthiness. Thus, trustworthiness is the demonstrated
625   ability and, therefore, the worthiness of an entity to be trusted to satisfy expectations, including
626   satisfying expectations in the face of adversity. Trustworthiness, being something demonstrated,
627   is based on evidence that supports a claim or judgment of an entity being worthy to be trusted
628   [Schroeder77] [Neumann04] [Levin07].

629   Since trust is not necessarily based on a judgment of trustworthiness, the decision to trust an
630   entity should consider the consequences, effects, and impacts of expectations not being fulfilled
631   because of non-performance, whether due to failure, deficiency, or incompetence. Trust that is
632   granted without establishing the required trustworthiness is a significant contributor to risk. The
633   concepts of trust and trustworthiness are discussed in greater detail in Appendix F.

            In January 2022, INCOSE released the Systems Engineering Vision 2035 [INCOSE22]. It is intended
            to inspire and guide the strategic direction for the global systems engineering community. A core
            element identified for the future state of systems engineering is increased confidence in systems
            to improve the practice of engineering trusted systems.
            [FUSE21] noted that a key problem to address in realizing Vision 2035 is that “Systems security
            has moved from its traditional focus on trust to a more singular focus on risk.” The need is to
            prove a level of system security through evidence-based assurance.

636   CHAPTER THREE

637   SYSTEM SECURITY CONCEPTS
638   ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE TO ENGINEER TRUSTWORTHY SECURE SYSTEMS

639   This chapter describes the aspects necessary for a systems engineering perspective on security. A
640   systems engineering perspective on security requires an understanding of the concepts of security
641   (Section 3.4) and system security (Section 3.5), as well as the nature and characteristics of systems
642   (Section 3.1). It also requires an understanding of the concepts of assets (Section 3.2) and loss
643   (Section 3.3) in order to reason about asset loss (Section 3.6) and determine protection needs
644   (Section 3.7). In satisfying such needs, specific viewpoints (Section 3.8) and how security is
645   demonstrated are considered, including what is adequate (Section 3.9). Holistically, the systems
646   engineering subdiscipline that encompasses these considerations is referred to as systems
647   security engineering (Section 3.10).

648   3.1 THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY
649   A system with freedom from those conditions that can cause a loss of assets with unacceptable
650   consequences must provide the intended behaviors and outcomes (e.g., the intended system
651   functionality) and avoid any unintended behaviors and outcomes that constitute a loss. The term
652   intended has two cases, both of which must be satisfied:
653   •    Design intent: As intended by the design
654   •    User intent: As intended by the user

655   A system delivering a capability per the design intent but inconsistent with the user intent
656   constitutes a loss. For example, vehicle control loss might result from a failure in the vehicle’s
657   steering control function (i.e., failure to meet the design intent) or through an attack that takes
658   control away from the driver (i.e., failure to meet the user intent). The primary security objective
659   is to ensure only the intended behaviors and outcomes occur, both with the system and within
660   the system. 17 Every security need and concern derive from this objective, which is based on the
661   concept of authorization for what is and is not allowed. 18 As such, the primary security control
662   objective is enforcing constraints in the form of rules for allowed and disallowed behaviors and
663   outcomes. This control objective – and a foundational principle of trustworthy secure design – is
664   Mediated Access. If access is not mediated (i.e., controlled though enforcing constraints) following
665   a set of non-conflicting rules, then no basis exists upon which to claim security is achieved.

666   The rules for mediated access are stated in a set of security policies 19 that reflect or are derived
667   from laws, directives, regulations, life cycle concepts, 20 requirements, or other specifically stated
668   stakeholder objectives. A security policy includes a scope of control that establishes bounds within


      17 Intended behaviors include interactions. Relevant interactions include human-to-machine and machine-to-machine

      interactions. Human-to-machine interactions are typically transformed into machine-to-machine interactions, whereby
      a machine element operates on behalf of the human.
      18 An attacker seeks to produce unauthorized behaviors or outcomes. Attackers attempt to accomplish something that

      they are not authorized to accomplish, even if that behavior or outcome is authorized for some other entity.
      19 A security policy is a set of rules governing security-relevant system and system element behavior. See Appendix C.

      20 Life cycle concepts include operation, sustainment, evolution, maintenance, training, startup, and shutdown.

      ________________________________________________________________________________________________


669   which the policy applies. Security policy rules are stated in terms of subjects (active entities),
670   objects (passive entities), and the operations the subject can perform or invoke on the object. 21
671   The rules govern subject-to-object and subject-to-subject behaviors and outcomes. Each security
672   policy rule must be accurate, consistent, compatible, and complete with respect to stakeholder
673   objectives for the defined scope of control. 22 Inconsistency, incompatibility, or incompleteness in
674   the security policy rules leads to protection gaps. Equally important is that the security protection
675   capabilities of the system are aligned with and can achieve the expectations of the policy.

676   Privileges 23 define the set of allowed and disallowed behavior and outcomes granted to a subject.
677   Privileges are the basis for making mediated access decisions. A restrictive default practice for
678   security policy enforcement is to design the enforcement mechanism to allow only what the policy
679   explicitly allows and to deny everything else. For a system to be deemed trustworthy secure, there
680   must be sufficient confidence that the system is capable of enforcing security policy on a
681   continuous basis for the duration of the time that the security policy is in effect (Appendix F).

682   3.2 THE CONCEPT OF AN ADEQUATELY SECURE SYSTEM
683   Adequate security is a concept that enables meaningful judgments about the idealistic nature of
684   security objectives. The definition of security expresses an ideal that encapsulates three essential
685   characteristics of a secure system. A secure system:
686   •    Enables the delivery of the required system capability despite intentional and unintentional
687        forms of adversity
688   •    Enforces constraints to ensure that only the desired behaviors and outcomes associated with
689        the required system capability are realized while satisfying the first aspect
690   •    Enforces constraints based on a set of rules to ensure that only authorized human-to-machine
691        and machine-to-machine interactions and operations are allowed to occur while satisfying
692        the second aspect

693   These characteristics are to be achieved to the extent practicable, therefore resulting in a gap
694   between the ideal secure system and the security performance that the system can dependably
695   achieve. 24 The judgment that a system is adequately secure 25 requires an evidence-based
696   determination that security performance is optimized against all other performance objectives
697   and constraints. The scope of conditions relevant to security and the acceptable level of security
698   are specific to the stakeholder needs. To be adequately secure, the system:
699   •    Is assessed to meet minimum tolerable levels 26 of security, as determined by experience,
700        analysis, or a combination of both
701   •    Is as secure as reasonably practicable (ASARP), (i.e., an incremental improvement in security
702        would require a disproportionate deterioration of meeting other system cost, schedule, or

      21 Active entities exhibit behavior (e.g., a process in execution) while passive entities do not (e.g., data, file).

      22 At the highest level of assurance, security policies are formally specified and verified.

      23 Privileges are also referred to as authorizations or rights.

      24 Because system security is asymmetric – that is, things can be observed to be insecure, but no observation allows

      one to declare an arbitrary system secure [Herley16] – the ideal cannot be achieved without some uncertainty.
      25 The concept of adequately secure is an adaptation of the concept of adequately safe from [NASA14].

      26 Below such levels, the system is considered insecure.

704        concessions such as an unacceptable change in the way operations are performed)

705   An adequately secure system does not necessarily preclude all of the conditions that can lead to
706   undesirable consequences. The minimum tolerable levels of security and interpretations of “as
707   secure as reasonably practicable” may not be fixed over the life of a system. The information
708   gathered while the system is in use and the lessons learned may inform candidate modifications
709   that raise the bar on either or both.

710   The concept of adequately secure is therefore, inherently context-dependent, and subjective in
711   nature. It is based on the assertions and expectations about the system security objectives and
712   determining those objectives have been achieved. Figure 4 illustrates the tradeoffs between
713   system security and the cost, schedule, and technical performance of the system.

717   All systems operate in and transition between a set of states. These states and transitions may
718   correspond to or be defined by characteristics of the system, such as how the system functions
719   (e.g., start, run, idle, recovery), how the system is used (e.g., operational, training, maintenance,
720   peacetime, wartime), and by environment conditions (e.g., temperature ranges, under fire or
721   not). There are security characteristics that determine whether each state or transition is secure,
722   insecure, or indeterminate (unknown whether secure or insecure). Adequate security depends on
723   being able to distinguish among secure, insecure, and indeterminate states and to keep the
724   system operating in secure states by applying the principles of Protective Failure and Protective
725   Recovery.

726   System states may be secure states (i.e., what states are desired and allowed) and insecure states
727   (i.e., what states are not desired nor allowed). Ideally, a secure system is a system that begins
728   execution in a secure state and does not transition to an insecure state. That is, every state
729   transition results in the same or another secure state. Each state transition must also be secure.
730   Figure 5 illustrates a subset of these “idealized” secure system state transitions.

731   Protective failure requires the ability to: (1) detect that the system is in an insecure state, and (2)
732   detect a transition that will place the system into an insecure state for the purposes of responding
733   to avoid the propagation of new failure. Protective failure calls for responsive and corrective
734   actions, including (when needed) transitioning to a secure halt state with a protected recovery to
735   allow for the continuation of operations in a reconstituted, reconfigured, or alternative secure
736   operational mode. Other stakeholder objectives may necessitate the continuation of operations
737   in a less-than-fully-secure state and should be reflected as necessary in such things as policy and
738   requirements (Appendix C.3).

739   Protective recovery requires the ability to take reactive, responsive, or corrective action to
740   securely transition from an insecure state to a secure state (or a less insecure state). The secure
741   state achieved after completing protective recovery actions includes those actions that limit or
742   prevent any further state transition and those that constitute a type of degraded capability, mode,
743   or operation.

765   3.4 THE CONCEPT OF ASSETS
766   An asset is an item of value. There are many different types of assets. Assets are broadly
767   categorized as either tangible or intangible. Tangible assets include physical items, such as
768   hardware, computing platforms, or other technology components. Intangible assets include
769   humans, firmware, software, capabilities, functions, services, trademarks, intellectual property,
770   data, copyrights, patents, image, or reputation. 28 Within asset categories, assets can be further
771   identified and described in terms of common asset classes as illustrated in Table 1.

772   Assets may also be considered as individual items or as an aggregate or group of items that spans
773   asset types or asset classes (e.g., personnel data, fire control function, environmental sensor
774   capability). This publication uses the term asset of interest to emphasize and establish bounds on
775   the scope of reasoning for a specific asset, asset type, or asset class.

          MATERIAL                This asset class includes physical property (e.g.,          Material resources are protected
          RESOURCES AND           buildings, facilities, equipment) and physical              from loss if they are not stolen,

                                  physical and organizational structures and facilities       to function or be used as intended,
                                  (i.e., infrastructure) needed for an activity or the        as needed, and when needed.
                                  operation of an enterprise or society. 29 An                Infrastructure is protected from
                                  infrastructure may be comprised of assets in other          loss if it meets performance
                                  classes. For example, the National Airspace System          expectations while delivering only

      27 To the extent feasible, self-protection is a required capability that enables the system to deliver the required

      stakeholder capabilities while also protecting their assets against loss and the consequences of loss.
      28 Humans are perhaps the most important and valuable of all intangible assets. Safety explicitly considers the human

      asset, and that same consideration is equally applicable to security.

779   The valuation of an asset is a key input in decision-making about investments to protect an asset.
780   Stakeholders determine valuation. For those cases where an asset is associated with multiple
781   stakeholders, there may be differing, contradictory, competing, or conflicting concerns about the
782   valuation of the asset. These differences are addressed as part of discussions that resolve
783   differences associated with agreements on needs, expectations, and requirements. An asset’s
784   valuation may be influenced by a variety of factors that include the cost (i.e., monetary, time,
785   material, human resources) to develop or acquire, the cost to maintain, the cost to repair or
786   replace, the cost if the asset is not repairable or replaceable, and the importance of completing
787   an objective.

788   3.5 THE CONCEPTS OF LOSS AND LOSS CONTROL
789   Loss is the experience of having an asset taken away or destroyed or the failure to keep or to
790   continue to have an asset in a desired state or form. 32 A loss typically results from an adverse
791   event or condition that causes unacceptable ramifications, consequences, or impacts. A specific
792   loss is determined and assessed independent of the causal events and conditions necessary to
793   produce the loss (i.e., the triggering event, such as an error of omission, or the exploitation event,
794   such as an attack). Examples of resultant adverse events or conditions and their ramifications,
795   impacts, or consequences include:
796   1. Adverse event or condition: Data is stolen or inadvertently disclosed on a public website; it
797      is no longer solely in the possession of the owner or entities authorized by the owner.
798        Ramification, impact, or consequence: Market share and competitive advantage is taken
799        away because the data that was lost or stolen provided detailed instructions for a precision
800        machining method that no other company possessed.
801   2. Adverse event or condition: Flat tire on a vehicle; it no longer supports the vehicle weight.
802        Ramification, impact, or consequence: One cannot drive the vehicle and needs alternate
803        transportation to get to work, the store, or go on vacation.
804   3. Adverse event or condition: Confidence in the system of interest operating correctly is lost
805      or questioned.
806        Ramification, impact, or consequence: A loss of trust in the system and its outputs, whether
807        the loss of confidence is justified or not.

808   While the loss condition or event is negative relative to the intended norm, the effect of the loss
809   can be either neutral/inconsequential or negative/consequential. For example, a flat tire on a
810   vehicle that is used only for off-road excursion is neutral /inconsequential if no such excursion is
811   planned or affected.

812   Loss may occur because of a single or combination of intentional and unintentional causes, events,
813   and conditions. These may include the authorized or unauthorized use of the system; intentional
814   acts of disruption or subversion; human and machine faults, errors, and failures; human acts of
815   misuse and abuse; and the by-product of emergence, side effects, and feature interaction. These
816   losses may be inconsequential to the mission or business objectives that the system supports –
817   the objectives may still be achieved despite suffering an immediate or eventual loss that impacts
818   other stakeholder objectives.

819   The potential to experience loss suggests the need for loss control objectives which serve as the
820   basis for judgments about effectively addressing the prevention and limiting of loss. This includes
821   the resultant adverse events and conditions and their ramifications. The loss control objectives
822   also serve as the basis to acquire evidence of assurance that the system as designed, built, used,
823   and sustained will adequately protect against loss while achieving its design intent. The loss
824   control objectives reflect an ideal to preserve the assets’ characteristics (i.e., state, condition,
825   form, utility) to the extent practicable despite the potential for those characteristics to be
826   changed. The objectives accept uncertainty in the form of limits to what can be done (i.e., not all
827   losses can be avoided) and limits to the effectiveness of what is done (i.e., anything done has its
828   scope of effectiveness and set of potential failure modes).

829   Due to uncertainty, it is not possible to guarantee that some form of loss will not occur. There is
830   a need to place an emphasis on protection against the effects of loss, including cascading or ripple
831   events (i.e., the immediate effect of a loss causes some additional unintended or undesired effect
832   or causes additional losses to occur). Thus, holistically protecting against loss and the unintended
833   or undesired effects of loss considers the full spectrum of possible loss across types of losses and
834   loss effects associated with each asset class. This is important considering that all forms of
835   adversity are not knowable. Therefore, it is prudent to ensure there is focus on the effect to be
836   controlled rather than on the cause when protecting against loss. A focus on cause is important,
837   but that focus should have a basis in the effect to be controlled.

838   The loss control objectives in Table 2 address the possibilities to control the potential for loss and
839   the effects of loss given the limits of certainty, feasibility, and practicality. Collectively, the loss
840   control objectives include the concerns attributed to security and to system safety, survivability,
841   and resilience. Note that satisfying loss control objectives may require trade-offs. Avoiding or
842   limiting the loss of one asset may come at the expense of not avoiding or limiting the loss of
843   another asset, as well as having trade-offs with other objectives (e.g., cost and schedule).

           OBJECTIVE

       LOSS PREVENTION          • This is the case where a loss is totally avoided. That is, despite the presence of adversity:
       (Prevent the loss          - The system continues to provide only the intended behavior and produces only the
       from occurring)              intended outcomes
                                  - The desired properties of the system and assets used by the system are retained
                                  - The assets continue to exist
                                • Loss avoidance may be achieved by any combination of:
                                  - Preventing or removing the event or events that cause the loss
                                  - Preventing or removing the condition or conditions that allow the loss to occur
                                  - Not suffering an adverse effect despite the events or conditions
                                • Terms such as avoid, continue, delay, divert, eliminate, harden, prevent, redirect, remove,
                                  tolerate, and withstand are typically used to characterize approaches to achieve this
                                  objective such that a loss does not occur despite the system being subjected to adversity
                                • The term tolerate refers to the objective of fault/failure tolerance, whereby adversity in
                                  the form of faults, errors, and failures is rendered inconsequential and does not alter or
                                  prevent the realization of authorized and intended system behavior and outcomes (i.e.,
                                  the faults, efforts, and failures are tolerated)

             OBJECTIVE

          LOSS LIMITATION        • This covers cases where a loss can or has occurred, and the extent of loss is to be limited
          (Limit the extent of   • The extent of loss can be limited in terms of any combination of the following:
          the loss)                - Limited dispersion (e.g., migration, propagation, spreading, ripple, domino, or cascading
                                     effects)
                                   - Limited duration (e.g., milliseconds, minutes, hours, days)
                                   - Limited capacity (e.g., diminished utility, delivery of function, service, or capability)
                                   - Limited volume (e.g., bits or bytes of data/information)
                                 • Decisions to limit the extent of loss may require prioritizing what constitutes acceptable
                                   loss across a set of losses, whereby the objective to limit the loss for one asset requires
                                   accepting a loss of some other asset
                                 • The extreme case of loss limitation is to avoid destruction of the asset
                                 • Terms such as tolerate, withstand, remove, continue, constrain, stop/halt, and restart fall
                                   into this category in the case where the loss occurs and the system can, or enables the
                                   ability to, limit the effect of the loss
                                 • Loss recovery and loss delay are two means to limit loss:
                                   - Loss Recovery: Action is taken by the system or enabled by the system to recover (or
                                     allow the recovery of) some or all of its ability to function (i.e., behave, interact,
                                     produce outcomes) and to recover assets used by the system (e.g., re-imaging,
                                     reloading, or recreating data and information, including software in the system). The
                                     restoration of the asset, fully or partially, can limit the dispersion, duration, capacity, or
                                     volume of the loss.
                                   - Loss Delay: The loss event is avoided until the adverse effect is lessened or when a
                                     delay enables a more robust response or quicker recovery.
                                 • System and environmental conditions may be assumed to result in loss, but measures are
                                   taken to limit impacts
                                 • Terms such as contain, recover, restore, reconstitute, reconfigure, and restart are typically
                                   used to characterize approaches to achieving this objective

845
846   3.6 REASONING ABOUT ASSET LOSS
847   As shown in Figure 6, the elements of a structured approach to reason about asset loss include:
848   (1) context of loss, (2) confidence in addressing loss, (3) significance of loss, (4) addressing loss,
849   and (5) cause of loss. The elements provide an asset-protection basis to determine the objectives
850   for a secure system, optimize the system protection capability, and judge the overall suitability
851   and effectiveness of the implemented protections. 33 The elements are also grouped into two
852   objectives to facilitate reasoning about the asset of interest:
853   •      OBJECTIVE 1: Determine asset protection needs
854          -    Context of Loss: The scope and criteria that bounds reasoning about asset loss
855          -    Significance of Loss: The effect of asset loss (or adverse impact) based upon its valuation
856          -    Confidence in Addressing Loss: The assurance to be achieved based on claims-driven and
857               evidence-based arguments about the effectiveness of what is done to address potential
858               and actual loss

      33 Applying the asset reasoning approach works equally to reason about assets in terms of mission (i.e., mission-driven

      asset reasoning), organization (i.e., organization-driven asset reasoning), and enterprise (i.e., enterprise-driven asset
      reasoning).

859   •    OBJECTIVE 2: Satisfy asset protection needs
860        -     Cause of Loss: The events, conditions, or circumstances that describe what has happened
861              before and what can happen in the future and that constitute the potential for loss to
862              occur
863        -     Addressing Loss: The various actions taken to exercise control over loss to the extent
864              practicable. The control objectives are to prevent loss from occurring and to limit the
865              extent and duration for those losses that do occur. Limiting loss includes recovery from
866              loss to the extent practicable.

867   Each of these elements is discussed in greater detail below.

868
869                                       FIGURE 6: REASONING ABOUT ASSET PROTECTION

870   The asset of interest is the asset class, asset type, or individual asset being addressed. Reasoning
871   about loss is based on the asset of interest. Distinguishing the asset of interest from all other
872   assets provides clarity in the interpretation of loss for the asset of interest and the associated
873   judgments of suitability and effectiveness of protections employed. A focus on a specific asset
874   class, type, or discrete element also enables precise traceability to requirements that support the
875   analysis needed to determine the protection-relevant impact of changes to requirements.

876   The context of loss establishes the boundary, scope, and time frame for the reasoning, analyses,
877   assessments, and conclusions about the asset of interest. The context of loss also provides a basis
878   to relate and trace asset dependencies and interactions and to group assets for protection. The




      CHAPTER THREE                                                                                               PAGE 22

      ________________________________________________________________________________________________


879   context of loss time frame is particularly important because the asset of interest has a life cycle 34
880   that is different from the system of interest. 35 For example, the asset of interest may be created,
881   configured, or modified outside of the scope of control of the system of interest yet be within the
882   scope of the engineering effort. The asset of interest, once within the scope of control of the
883   system of interest, may have differing protection needs associated with the state or mode of the
884   system (e.g., the system operational mode protection may differ from the system training mode).
885   Additionally, system life cycle assets (Section 3.8) may exist only within a development or
886   production system and their associated supporting environments. The effect of the loss for these
887   assets may transfer to a loss associated with the system of interest. Therefore, the context of loss
888   includes the life cycle of the asset, the state and mode of the system, and other time-based
889   periods or characteristics during which loss is addressed.

890

                                            TIMEFRAME OF LOSS – AN EXAMPLE
            A financial portfolio (an asset or collection of assets) with specific investment objectives and risk
            acceptance considerations may be created by a financial advisor for a client, funded by the client,
            and subsequently managed using multiple systems across one or more institutional investment
            firms throughout the portfolio’s life cycle. Each asset of interest within the portfolio may have
            differing protection needs at different times depending on the type of asset, market conditions,
            regulatory jurisdiction, risk position, and other asset management factors that are imposed on
            the system.

891
892
893   The significance of loss is the adverse effect on the asset of interest or the resultant adverse effect
894   associated with the asset. The significance of loss is best described as an experience that is to be
895   avoided, thereby warranting an investment to protect against it occurring and to minimize the
896   extent of the adverse effect should it occur. The significance of loss is determined and assessed
897   as an effects-based judgment. That is, it is determined without any consideration of how or why
898   the loss occurs, the probability or likelihood of the loss occurring, and any intent or the absence
899   of intent related to the loss. 36

900   The consequence of loss simply answers the following question: “What are the ramifications,
901   effects, and problems that result from suffering a loss of the asset of interest?” The significance
902   of loss requires clarity in what loss means for the asset of interest. Examples of terms used to
903   describe asset loss include ability, accessibility, accuracy, assurance, advantage (technological,
904   competitive, combatant), capability, control, correctness, existence, investment, ownership,
905   performance, possession, precision, quality, satisfaction, and time.



      34 The lifetime of an asset may be different from the lifetime of the system. Assets may predate the system and may

      persist after the system’s retirement from use. The significance of the loss of an asset can have ramifications that are
      independent of the system, system function, and business and mission objectives.
      35 The asset life cycle is the same as the system life cycle when the asset of interest is the system of interest. The asset

      life cycle may be the same or shorter than the system life cycle for those assets created by the system of interest and
      only required while the system of interest is operating.
      36 Determining the consequence of loss is not a determination of risk.




      CHAPTER THREE                                                                                                       PAGE 23

906   Confidence in addressing loss ensures that protections have a body of objective evidence that
907   demonstrates the effectiveness, sufficiency, and suitability of protective measures to satisfy asset
908   protection needs. Confidence in addressing loss is cumulative. It begins with determining the loss
909   concerns for the asset of interest and continuously builds as those concerns are better understood
910   and addressed across the context of loss, the consequence of loss, the causes of loss, and how
911   loss is addressed. The evidence basis that provides confidence is informed by verification and
912   validation activities that occur throughout the life cycles of the assets and the system, including
913   requirements elicitation and analysis. A key informing element to those activities is to ensure that
914   the results contribute to the confidence sought.

915   The cause of loss 37 is the individual or combination of events, conditions, and circumstances that
916   result in some form of loss of an asset. The causes of asset loss constitute a continuum that
917   includes intentional, unintentional, accidental, incidental, misuse, abuse, error, defect, fault,
918   weakness, and failure events and conditions. This continuum spans all human-based, machine-
919   based, physical-based, and nature-based drivers of loss. The following considerations apply to
920   reasoning about the causes of loss:
921   •    Single events and conditions that alone can produce the loss
922   •    Combinations, sequences, and aggregate events and conditions
923   •    Events and conditions that are desirable, intended, and even planned yet produce
924        unanticipated, unforeseen, and unpredictable results
925   •    Cascading and ripple events and conditions

926

                                           SIGNIFICANCE OF LOSS – AN EXAMPLE
            The significance of loss due to a flat tire is determined and assessed without consideration of
            how or why the tire became flat (e.g., puncture, manufacturing defect, impact with curb or other
            object) and without any consideration of malicious intent (e.g., tire cut, valve stem loosened).
            Regardless of how or why the tire became flat, the significance of loss remains the same (e.g.,
            loss of control if the vehicle is moving, inability to drive if the vehicle is stationary, time lost to
            replace or repair the tire to make the vehicle operable). The significance of loss due to a flat tire
            includes the inability to steer the vehicle, and the resultant adverse effect may be to impact
            some other object (i.e., a crash). The adverse effect of the loss of steering (loss of control) is
            specific, while the adverse effect of a crash is general (many other circumstances may result in a
            crash without any loss of the ability to steer the vehicle).

927
928



      37 Many terms are used to describe the cause of asset loss. Some of these terms are specific to a community of interest

      or specialty field, while others span communities and specialties. There are also cases where the same term may be
      used differently across communities and specialty fields (e.g., the term threat has varying interpretations across
      communities, such as physical security, cybersecurity, commerce, law enforcement, industry, military combat
      operations, and military intelligence). The terms typically used as a synonym for the cause of asset loss include attack,
      breach, compromise, hazard, mishap, threat, violation, and vulnerability.

      ________________________________________________________________________________________________


929   Finally, the causes of asset loss answer the following questions: “How can loss occur?” and “How
930   has loss occurred in the past?” However, determining how loss can occur does not require asking
931   or answering the question “What is likely or probable to happen?” 38

932   Addressing loss occurs through the protective measures that enforce constraints to ensure that
933   only authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes of the system occur. These include:
934   •    Protective measures that are provided by the machine portion of the system (i.e., the system
935        architecture and design, the use of engineered features and devices within the architecture
936        and design)
937   •    Protective measures that are provided by the human in the system (i.e., personnel, practices,
938        procedures, the use of tools to support the human as a system element, and the human role
939        in designing and building the machine part of the system)
940   •    Protective measures that are provided by the physical environment (i.e., controlled access
941        areas, facility access points, physical monitoring, environmental controls, fire suppression)

942   The terminology used to describe means and methods includes mechanisms, configurations,
943   controls, safeguards, countermeasures, features, techniques, overrides, practices, procedures,
944   processes, and inhibits. These may be applied in accordance with governing policies, regulations,
945   laws, practices, standards, and techniques.

                            ASSET-BASED PROTECTION – ENGINEERING FOR SUCCESS
           Don’t focus on what is likely to happen. Instead, focus on what can happen, and be prepared.
           That is what systems security engineering means by adopting a proactive and reactive strategy
           (Section D.2) in the form of a concept of secure function that addresses the spectrum of asset loss
           and associated consequences. This means proactively planning and designing to prevent the loss
           of an asset that you are not willing to accept, to be able to minimize the consequences should
           such a loss occur, and to be in an informed position to reactively recover from the loss when it
           does happen.

947
948
949   3.7 PROTECTION NEEDS
950   Stakeholders have a need to achieve their mission or business objectives in a secure manner that
951   preserves assets and limits the extent of asset loss. Asset protection must be continuous, thereby
952   making it possible for stakeholders to have a realistic expectation of continuous success in the
953   ability of their systems to support and achieve their objectives.

954   The scope and expectations for the protection of assets is foundational to achieving the design
955   intent for a trustworthy secure system. Protection needs typically correlate to the severity of
956   consequences associated with the loss of an asset. The protection needs are determined from all
957   needs, concerns, priorities, and constraints to protect and preserve stakeholder and system

      38 This point distinguishes analysis of what can happen from a risk assessment that determines probability greater than

      zero and less than one that the adverse event will happen.

964   The purpose of establishing the need for protection is to decide what assets to protect and to
965   determine the priority given to such protection. This can be accomplished without considering a
966   cause or condition against which to protect. As shown in Figure 8, the need for protection is
967   derived from the relationship among the asset of interest, context of loss, type of loss, and the
968   consequences of loss. This approach establishes the need for protection that, once validated by
969   stakeholders across all assets of interest, provides the basis for developing security objectives and
970   requirements. 39
971

            No system can provide absolute security due to the limits of human certainty, the uncertainty
            that exists in the life cycle of every system, and the constraints of cost, schedule, performance,
            feasibility, and practicality. As such, trade-offs made routinely across contradictory, competing,
            and conflicting needs and constraints are optimized to achieve adequate security, which reflects
            a decision made by stakeholders.

972
973

      39 Requirements provide a formal and clear expression of the needs, concerns, priorities, and constraints to be satisfied

      for system function, operation, and maintenance. Each requirement is accompanied by verification methods for
      demonstrating that the requirement is satisfied. Requirements must be accurate, unambiguous, comprehensive,
      evaluatable, and achievable.

977   Summarizing, the following considerations impact the identification of protection needs:
978   •    Assets have different classes and types
979   •    Assets are associated with stakeholders and the system
980        -      Some assets are associated with stakeholders (i.e., stakeholder assets) and have a
981               purpose, use, and existence that is independent of the system being designed
982        -      Some assets are associated with the system, are dependent on characteristics of the
983               system design and behavior, and are typically unknown to stakeholders
984   •    Loss interpretation is dual-faceted
985        -      The effect on the asset of interest
986        -      The effect on those who value the asset of interest
987   •    Loss interpretation is temporal and state-based
988        -      Spans a continuum within and across asset types and classes
989        -      May change across the life cycle of the asset and the state in which the asset exists or is
990               utilized

 993        -     Asset loss ramifications
 994        -     Asset protection suitability, effectiveness, and dependability

 995   The stakeholder perspective is based on the assets that belong to stakeholders. Therefore, those
 996   stakeholders determine the protection needs. The system perspective is based on the assets
 997   necessary for the system to function. These assets are determined by system design decisions and
 998   the criticality and priority 40 of the asset in providing or supporting the functions of the system.
 999   Stakeholders are typically unaware of the existence of system assets and are not able to make
1000   decisions about the protection needs for system assets. The protection of system assets is an
1001   element of trustworthy secure system design.

1002   Protection needs are continuously reassessed and adjusted as variances, changes, and trades
1003   occur throughout the system life cycle. These include the maturation of the system design and
1004   life cycle concepts, improved understanding of the operational environment (e.g., a more
1005   thorough understanding of adversities), and changes in understanding the consequences of asset
1006   loss. Revisiting protection needs is a necessary part of the iterative nature of systems engineering
1007   and with it, systems security engineering – necessary to ensure completeness in understanding
1008   the problem space, exploring all feasible solutions, and engineering a trustworthy secure system.

1009   3.8 SYSTEM SECURITY VIEWPOINTS
1010   Three predominant viewpoints of system security include system function, security function, and
1011   life cycle assets. These viewpoints shape the considerations that are used as trustworthy secure
1012   design considerations for any system type, intended use, and consequence of system failure.

1013   Every system is delivered to satisfy stakeholder capability needs. These needs constitute the
1014   system function – the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it
1015   delivers combined with its intended use. The system function is the predominant viewpoint and
1016   establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.

1017   The stakeholder capability needs include the protection capability needs. The protection needs
1018   parallel the concept of stakeholder capability needs and constitute the system’s security function
1019   – the totality of the system’s purpose or role to securely satisfy stakeholder capability needs. The
1020   security function enforces security-driven constraints as part of the overall system design. The
1021   constraints have the purpose to avoid, reduce, and tolerate susceptibilities, defects, weaknesses,
1022   and flaws in the system that may constitute a vulnerability that can be exploited or triggered.
1023   These vulnerabilities can reside within the system’s structure or behaviors and can have the effect
1024   to counter, defeat, or minimize the ability of the system to effectively satisfy its design intent to
1025   deliver the required capability. Thus, the constraints also enable the synthesis of the security
1026   function within the system function in a non-conflicting manner.

1027   The security function of the system has both passive and active aspects:
1028   •    Passive aspects of the security function do not exhibit behavior (i.e., are non-functional in
1029        nature). They include the system architecture and design elements. The passive aspects are

       40 Criticality and priority based on asset valuation is typically used in decisions on protection needs. An asset with higher

       criticality and priority would take precedence in providing protection should there be constraints that require choosing
       between the overall protection needs.



       CHAPTER THREE                                                                                                        PAGE 28

1030        part of the system structure and are therefore embodied in the architecture of the system.
1031        For example, the functional architecture may segment system functions (including security
1032        functions) into different subsystems, reducing the possibility of interference among functions
1033        as well as limiting the propagation of erroneous behavior. Passive aspects inherently reduce
1034        the susceptibility of the system to exposure, hazard, and vulnerability, thereby limiting if not
1035        eliminating the potential for loss scenarios. The employment of passive aspects generally
1036        enables greater confidence in the protection capability of the system.
1037   •    Active aspects of the security function exhibit behavior (i.e., are functional in nature). They
1038        include engineered features and devices, referred to as controls, countermeasures, features,
1039        inhibits, mechanisms, overrides, safeguards, or services. The active aspects are employed or
1040        allocated within the system architecture, have a specific design, and have capabilities and
1041        limitations that affect their suitability and effectiveness relative to their intended use.

1042   Passive and active aspects of security function factor into trades, as discussed in Section D.4.4.
1043   Active aspects may also require additional hardware or loads on existing hardware, increasing
1044   demands for size, weight, and power (SWaP) and making active aspects a challenge for SWaP-
1045   restricted systems (e.g., satellites).

1046   Life cycle assets are assets associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered
1047   with the system. Their association with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss
1048   or a conduit/means through which a loss can occur. Life cycle assets have several types:
1049   •    Systems that interact with the system of interest, including conceptual systems (Section 2.1.1)
1050   •    Intellectual property in various forms, including proprietary algorithms, technologies, and
1051        technology solutions
1052   •    Data and information associated with the system
1053   •    Developmental, manufacturing, fabrication, and production capabilities, systems, and
1054        environment systems and capabilities used to utilize, operate, and sustain the system 41

1055   3.9 DEMONSTRATING SYSTEM SECURITY
1056   Demonstrating that a system is adequately secure (Section 3.2) has the objective of providing
1057   stakeholders with confidence that their objectives, needs, concerns, and associated constraints
1058   have been addressed. Such demonstration must consider the system as an emergent 42 whole that
1059   consists of:
1060   •    The required capability it delivers
1061   •    The protection capability


       41 Examples include software and hardware development tools and suites; modeling and simulation environments and

       tools; maintenance and diagnostics devices, components, and suites; simulators and test-case scenario generators; and
       training systems. While these assets are not necessarily within the scope of engineering the system of interest,
       behaviors and outcomes of these systems have security implications that must be addressed in the secure design of
       the system of interest. The behaviors and outcomes to consider include how they might directly or indirectly enable,
       interface, interact, and interoperate with the system of interest.
       42 An emergent property is a property exhibited by entities meaningful only when attributed to the whole [ISO 21840],

       not any individual constituent element. Emergent properties of systems include its capability, safety, security, reliability,
       resilience, agility, survivability, maintainability, and availability. Appendix D discusses emergence in more detail.

1062   •    The limits of certainty 43

1063   In particular, the limits of certainty apply to requirements and accepting the potential errors,
1064   inconsistencies, or gaps in the completeness and coverage of those requirements. Therefore, the
1065   requirements and associated verification and validation methods, while a necessary aspect of
1066   demonstrating adequate security, are not sufficient to deem a system as adequately secure. The
1067   level of confidence provided must be commensurate with the asset loss consequences addressed.
1068   The evidence basis for demonstrating confidence must be recorded, traced, maintained, and
1069   evolved as variances that are relevant to demonstrating adequate security occur throughout the
1070   system life cycle. Additionally, the evidence basis must be meaningful to reasoning by subject-
1071   matter experts across the subjective, competing, and often contradicting needs and beliefs of
1072   stakeholders.

1073   Demonstrating this justified confidence, or assurance, is achieved by an evidentiary basis provided
1074   by systems analyses and other evidence-producing activities. 44 The evidentiary basis is used
1075   within an approach for structured reasoning, as demonstrated in assurance cases (Section 4.3).
1076   The reasoning considers the system needs and capabilities, contributing system quantitative and
1077   qualitative factors, and how these capabilities and factors compose in the context of system
1078   security to produce an evidentiary base upon which further analyses are conducted. In turn, these
1079   analyses support substantiated and reasoned conclusions that serve as the basis for consensus
1080   among stakeholders that the system is adequately secure (Appendix F).

             with the rules, expectations, and constraints established by NASCAR.
             Based on those stakeholder objectives, NASCAR rules, the specific conditions anticipated on the
             racetrack, and the strategy for how the racing team decides to compete, the requirements that
             include performance and safety considerations are defined as part of the systems engineering
             process and subsequently, appropriate investments are made to produce a racecar that meets
             those requirements. While the typical race car is more expensive than a family car, the additional
             expense is justified by the stakeholder mission and business objectives, strategy for competing,
             and willingness to preserve (i.e., engineer against loss) their most critical asset – the driver.

       43 An individual function or mechanism can be verified and validated for correctness and its quality and performance

       attributes. Those results help inform the determination of system security but are insufficient alone.
       44 While the evidence obtained through demonstrating compliance to a set of expectations or criteria may support

       judgments of adequate security, such evidence alone does not support a claim of adequate security.

1083   3.10 SYSTEMS SECURITY ENGINEERING
1084   Systems security engineering is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enabling the
1085   successful realization, use, and retirement of engineered trustworthy secure systems. Systems
1086   security engineering employs systems, security, and other principles and concepts, as well as
1087   scientific, technological, and management methods. Systems security engineering ensures that
1088   these principles, concepts, methods, and practices are applied during the entire system life cycle
1089   to achieve stakeholder objectives for assured trustworthiness and asset protection despite
1090   adversity. It also helps to reduce system defects that can lead to vulnerability and, as a result,
1091   reduces the effect adversity can have on the system.

1092   As part of a transdisciplinary systems engineering effort to deliver a trustworthy secure system,
1093   systems security engineering:
1094   •    Works with stakeholders to ensure security objectives, protection needs/concerns, assurance
1095        needs, security requirements (including associated measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and
1096        measures of performance (MOPs)), and associated validation methods are defined
1097   •    Defines system security requirements 45 and associated verification methods
1098   •    Develops security views and viewpoints of the system architecture and design
1099   •    Identifies and assesses susceptibilities and vulnerabilities to life cycle hazards and adversities
1100   •    Designs proactive and reactive features and functions included within a balanced strategy to
1101        control asset loss and associated loss consequences
1102   •    Provides security considerations to inform systems engineering efforts with the objective to
1103        reduce errors, flaws, and weaknesses that may constitute a security vulnerability
1104   •    Performs system security analyses and interprets the results of other system analyses in
1105        support of decision-making for engineering trades and risk management
1106   •    Identifies, quantifies, and evaluates the costs and benefits of security features and functions
1107        and considerations to inform assessments of alternative solutions, engineering trade-offs,
1108        and risk treatment 46 decisions
1109   •    Demonstrates through evidence-based reasoning that security and trustworthiness claims for
1110        the system have been satisfied to the desired level of assurance
1111   •    Leverages multiple security and other specialties to address all feasible solutions
1112   Systems security engineering is a systems engineering subdiscipline that overlaps with other
1113   subdisciplines and leverages multiple specialties to accomplish systems security engineering
1114   activities and tasks. These specialties include computer security; communications security;
1115   transmission security; electronic emissions security; anti-tamper protection; physical security;
1116   information, software, hardware, and supply chain assurance; and technology specialties such as
1117   biometrics and cryptography. Figure 9 illustrates the relationship among systems engineering,
1118   systems security engineering, and contributing security and other specialty engineering areas.


       45 It is important to understand the context in which the term system security requirement is being used in this

       publication. For example, due to the complexity of system security, there are several types and purposes of system
       security requirements. See Section 3.8 and Appendix C.
       46 The term risk treatment is used in [ISO 15288] and defined in [ISO 73].

1127   CHAPTER FOUR

1128   SYSTEM SECURITY ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK
1129   CONCEPTUAL VIEW OF KEY CONTEXTS OF ACTIVITIES AND TASKS

1130   The systems security engineering framework [McEvilley15] provides a conceptual view of the key
1131   contexts within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines, bounds,
1132   and focuses activities and tasks toward achieving stakeholder security objectives and presents a
1133   coherent, well-formed, evidence-based case to support judgements about achievement of the
1134   objectives. 49 The framework is independent of system type and engineering or acquisition process
1135   model and is not to be interpreted as a sequence of flows or steps but rather as a set of interacting
1136   contexts, each with its own checks and balances. The systems security engineering framework
1137   emphasizes an integrated, holistic security perspective across all system life cycle stages and is
1138   applied to satisfy the milestone objectives of each life cycle stage.

1139   The framework defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks: (1) the problem context,
1140   (2) the solution context, (3) and the trustworthiness context. Establishing the three contexts helps
1141   to ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.
1142   This understanding is described in a set of stakeholder security objectives that reflect protection
1143   needs and security concerns instead of by security solutions brought forth without considering
1144   the entire problem space and its associated constraints. Moreover, there is explicit focus and a
1145   set of activities to demonstrate the worthiness of the solution in providing adequate security
1146   across competing and often conflicting constraints. While the framework appears to follow a
1147   sequential execution across the three contexts, it is actually implemented in an iterative manner
1148   within the system life cycle stages and guided and informed by system analyses (Section H.6).
1149   Decision gates control the transitions between life cycle stages. Iteration facilitates refining the
1150   problem statement, proposed solutions, and trustworthiness objectives.

1151   The three framework contexts share a common foundational base of system security analyses,
1152   including system analyses with security interpretations of the analyses results. System security
1153   analyses produce data to support engineering and stakeholder decision-making. Such analyses
1154   are differentiated for application within the problem, solution, and trustworthiness contexts and
1155   employ a variety of concepts, principles, techniques, means, methods, processes, practices, and
1156   tools. System security analyses:
1157   •    Provide relevant data and technical interpretations of system issues from the system security
1158        perspective
1159   •    Are differentiated in their application to align with the scope and objectives of where they are
1160        applied within the systems security engineering framework
1161   •    Are performed with a level of fidelity, rigor, and formality to produce data with a level of
1162        confidence that matches the assurance required by the stakeholders and engineering team
1163        (Appendix F)

1169   System security analyses address important topic areas related to systems security engineering.
1170   These areas include architecture, assurance, behavior, cost, criticality, design, effectiveness,
1171   emergence, exposure, fit-for-purpose, life cycle concepts, penetration resistance, performance
1172   (including security performance), protection needs, security objectives, privacy, requirements,
1173   resilience, risk, strength of function, threats, trades, uncertainty, vulnerability, verification, and
1174   validation.

1175   The systems security engineering framework includes a closed loop feedback for interactions
1176   among and between the three framework contexts and the requisite system security analyses to
1177   continuously identify and address variances as the variances are introduced into the engineering
1178   effort. The feedback loop also helps to achieve continuous process improvement for the system,
1179   including viewing the outputs of one life cycle phase (i.e., the “solution” to the phase) as the inputs
1180   to the next phase (i.e., the “problem” for the next phase).

1181   4.1 THE PROBLEM CONTEXT
1182   The problem context defines the basis for an acceptably and adequately secure system. It focuses
1183   on stakeholders’ concerns about unacceptable losses given their mission, operational capability,
1184   and performance needs and concerns, as well as all associated cost, schedule, performance, and
1185   risk-driven constraints. The problem context enables the engineering team to focus on acquiring
1186   as complete an understanding of the stakeholder problem as practical, to explore all feasible
1187   solution class options, and to select the solution class option or options to be pursued. The
1188   problem context includes:
1189   •    Determining life cycle security concepts 50
1190   •    Defining security objectives
1191   •    Defining security requirements
1192   •    Determining measures of success

1193   The security objectives are foundational, establishing and scoping what it means to be adequately
1194   secure in terms of protection against asset loss and the consequences of such loss. The security
1195   objectives have associated measures of success. These measures constitute specific and
1196   measurable criteria relative to operational performance measures and stakeholder concerns.
1197   Measures of success include both strength of protection and level of assurance in the protection
1198   capability that has been engineered. These measures influence developing security requirements
1199   and assurance claims.

1200   Life cycle security concepts are the processes, methods, and procedures associated with the
1201   system throughout its life cycle and provide distinct contexts for interpretation of system security.
1202   These concepts also serve to scope and bound attention in addressing protection needs and for
1203   broader security-informing considerations and constraints. Protection needs are determined
1204   based on the security objectives, life cycle concepts, and stakeholder concerns. The protection
1205   needs are subsequently transformed into stakeholder security requirements and associated
1206   constraints, and the measures needed to validate that all requirements have been met. A well-
1207   defined and stakeholder-validated problem definition and context provides the foundation for all
1208   systems engineering and systems security engineering and supporting activities.

1209   The problem context may be interpreted within a life cycle phase as being informed by solutions
1210   from earlier life cycle stages, thereby providing a more accurate statement of the problem and its
1211   associated constraints. For example, the stakeholder requirements may be the “solution” of an
1212   early life cycle phase which then constrains activities completed in later life cycle stages.



       50 The term life cycle security concept refers to the processes and activities associated with the system throughout the

       life cycle (from concept development through retirement) with specific security considerations. It is an extension of the
       concept of operation and includes the processes and activities related to development, prototyping, assessment of
       alternative solutions, training, logistics, maintenance, sustainment, evolution, modernization, refurbishment and
       disposal. Each life cycle concept has one or more security considerations and constraints that must be fully integrated
       into the life cycle to ensure that the system security objectives can be met. Life cycle security concepts include those
       applied during acquisition and program management. Life cycle security concepts can affect such things as Requests
       for Information, Requests for Proposal, Statements of Work, source selections, development and test environments,
       operating environments, supply chains, supporting infrastructures, distribution, logistics, maintenance, training,
       clearances, and background checks.

1213   4.2 THE SOLUTION CONTEXT
1214   The solution context establishes the security aspects and constraints for the architecture and
1215   design of the system that: (1) satisfies the requirements and objectives of the problem context,
1216   (2) realizes the design for the system, and (3) produces sufficient evidence to demonstrate that
1217   the requirements and objectives of the problem context have been satisfied. 51 The solution
1218   context is based on a balanced proactive and reactive system security protection strategy 52 that
1219   exercises control over events, conditions, asset loss, and the consequence of loss to the degree
1220   possible, practicable, and acceptable to stakeholders. The solution context includes:
1221   •    Defining the security aspects of the solution
1222   •    Realizing the security aspects of the solution
1223   •    Producing evidence for the security aspects of the solution

1224   The security aspects of the solution include the development of a system protection strategy;
1225   allocated and derived security requirements; security architecture views and viewpoints; security
1226   design; security aspects, capabilities, and limitations in the system life cycle procedures; and
1227   security performance verification measures. The security aspects of the solution are realized
1228   during the implementation of the system design in accordance with the system architecture and
1229   in satisfaction of the security requirements. The evidence associated with the security aspects of
1230   the solution is obtained with a fidelity and rigor influenced by the level of assurance 53 targeted by
1231   the security objectives. Assurance evidence is obtained from standard systems engineering
1232   verification methods (e.g., analysis, demonstration, inspection, testing, and evaluation) and
1233   complementary validation methods applied against the stakeholder requirements. Application of
1234   the solution context may be interpreted to provide a part of the solution, constraining the next
1235   iteration of the problem context.

1236   4.3 THE TRUSTWORTHINESS CONTEXT
1237   The trustworthiness context is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based
1238   demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not)
1239   based on a set of claims derived from security objectives. This context consists of:
1240   •    Developing and maintaining the assurance case
1241   •    Demonstrating that the assurance case is satisfied

1242   The trustworthiness context is grounded in the concept of an assurance case. An assurance case
1243   is a well-defined and structured set of arguments and a body of evidence showing that a system
1244   satisfies specific claims. 54 Assurance cases provide reasoned, auditable artifacts that support the


       51 Security constraints are transformed and incorporated into system design requirements with metadata-tagging to

       identify security relevance.
       52 The system security protection strategy is consistent with the overall concept of secure function. The concept of

       secure function, defined during the problem context, constitutes a strategy for a proactive and reactive protection
       capability throughout the system life cycle (Section D.2). The strategy has the objective to provide freedom from specific
       concerns associated with asset loss and loss consequences.
       53 Assurance is the measure of confidence associated with a given requirement. As the level of assurance increases, so

       does the scope, depth, and rigor associated with the methods and analyses conducted (Appendix F).

1245   contention that a top-level claim or set of claims is satisfied, including systematic argumentation
1246   and underlying evidence and explicit assumptions that support the claims [ISO 15026-2]. The
1247   claims may build from subclaims. For a given life cycle stage, an outcome may sufficiently satisfy
1248   a subclaim or set of subclaims, such as a subclaim that stakeholder requirements are sufficiently
1249   comprehensive to support an overall claim that the realized system is adequately secure.

1250   Assurance cases are used to demonstrate that a system exhibits some complex emergent
1251   property, such as safety, security, resilience, reliability, or survivability. An effective security
1252   assurance case contains foundational security claims derived from security objectives, credible
1253   and relevant evidence that substantiates the claims, and valid arguments that relate the various
1254   evidence to the supported security claims. The result provides a compelling statement that
1255   adequate security has been achieved and driven by stakeholder needs and expectations.

1256   Assurance cases typically include supporting information, such as assumptions, constraints, and
1257   inferences that affect the reasoning process. As part of assurance case development, subject-
1258   matter expert analyses determine all security claims are substantiated by the evidence and the
1259   arguments relating the evidence to the claims. Assurance cases must be maintained in response
1260   to variances throughout the engineering effort.

1261   An assurance case’s specific form and the level of rigor and formality in acquiring the evidence
1262   required is a trade space consideration. It involves the target (desired) level of assurance, the
1263   nature of the consequences for which assurance is sought, and the size and complexity of the
1264   dimensions that factor into determining trustworthiness. The assurance case is an engineering
1265   construct and must be managed accordingly to ensure that the expended effort is justified by the
1266   need for the evidence in determining trustworthiness. The assurance claims are the key
1267   trustworthiness factor and are developed from the security objectives and associated measures
1268   of success independent of the system realization and its supporting evidence. Trustworthiness
1269   and assurance are discussed further in Appendix F.

                     SYSTEMS SECURITY ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK – WHY IT MATTERS
             Establishing the problem, solution, and trustworthiness contexts as key components of a systems
             security engineering framework helps ensure that the security of a system is based on achieving
             a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem as defined by a set of stakeholder security
             objectives, security concerns, protection needs, and security requirements. This understanding
             is essential to develop effective security solutions – that is, a system that is sufficiently
             trustworthy and adequately secure to protect stakeholder’s assets in terms of loss and the
             associated consequences.

 [ISO 19014]                                   to capture and convey information (e.g., models, source
                                               code).
 aspect                                        The parts, features, and characteristics used to describe,

 asset                                         Anything that has value to a person or organization.
 [ISO 24765]                                   Note 1: Assets have interrelated characteristics that include value,
                                               criticality, and the degree to which they are relied upon to achieve
                                               organizational mission/business objectives. From these
                                               characteristics, appropriate protections are to be engineered into
                                               solutions employed by the organization.
                                               Note 2: An asset may be tangible (e.g., physical item such as
                                               hardware, software, firmware, computing platform, network
                                               device, or other technology components) or intangible (e.g.,
                                               information, data, trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual
                                               property, image, or reputation).

 [ISO 15026-1]                                 be achieved.
                                               Note 1: Assurance is typically obtained relative to a set of specific
                                               claims. The scope and focus of such claims may vary (e.g., security
                                               claims, safety claims) and the claims themselves may be
                                               interrelated.
                                               Note 2: Assurance is obtained through techniques and methods
                                               that generate credible evidence to substantiate claims.

 assurance case                                A reasoned, auditable artifact created that supports the
 [ISO 15026-1]                                 contention that its top-level claim (or set of claims), is
                                               satisfied, including systematic argumentation and its
                                               underlying evidence and explicit assumptions that support
                                               the claim(s).
 assurance evidence                            The information upon which decisions regarding assurance,
                                               trustworthiness, and risk of the solution are substantiated.
                                               Note: Assurance evidence is specific to an agreed-to set of claims.
                                               The security perspective focuses on assurance evidence for
                                               security-relevant claims whereas other engineering disciplines may
                                               have their own focus (e.g., safety).
 availability                                  Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an
 [ISO 7498-2]                                  authorized entity.


 baseline                                      Formally approved version of a configuration item, regardless
 [IEEE 828]                                    of media, formally designated and fixed at a specific time
                                               during the configuration item's life cycle.
                                               Note: The engineering process generates many artifacts that are
                                               maintained as a baseline over the course of the engineering effort
                                               and after its completion. The configuration control processes of the
                                               engineering effort manage baselined artifacts. Examples include
                                               stakeholder requirements baseline, system requirements baseline,
                                               architecture/design baseline, and configuration baseline.
 behavior                                      The way an entity functions as an action, reaction, or
 [ISO 14258 adapted]                           interaction.
                                               How a system element, system, or system of systems acts,
                                               reacts, and interacts.
 body of evidence                              The totality of evidence used to substantiate trust,
                                               trustworthiness, and risk relative to the system.

 breakdown structure                           Framework for efficiently controlling some aspect of the
 [ISO 27026]                                   activities for a program or project.
                                               Note: Examples include work breakdown structure, the
                                               decomposition of the defined scope of a project into progressively
                                               lower levels consisting of elements of work, and product

 concept of operations                         Verbal and graphic statement, in broad outline, of an
 [ANSI G043B]                                  organization’s assumptions or intent in regard to an
                                               operation or series of operations of new, modified, or existing
                                               organizational systems.
                                               Note 1: The concept of operations frequently is embodied in long-
                                               range strategic plans and annual operational plans. In the latter
                                               case, the concept of operations in the plan covers a series of
                                               connected operations to be conducted simultaneously or in
                                               succession to achieve an organizational performance objective.
                                               Note 2: The concept of operations provides the basis for bounding
                                               the operating space, system capabilities, interfaces, and operating

 [INCOSE19]                                    at which failure occurs (derives from physical design margin).
 operator                                      Individual or organization that performs the operations of a
 [ISO 15288]                                   system.
                                               Note 1: The role of operator and the role of user can be vested,
                                               simultaneously or sequentially, in the same individual or
                                               organization.
                                               Note 2: An individual operator combined with knowledge, skills, and
                                               procedures can be considered as an element of the system.
                                               Note 3: An operator may perform operations on a system that is
                                               operated, or of a system that is operated, depending on whether or
                                               not operating instructions are placed within the system boundary.

                                               resources and requirements.
                                               Note: A project is sometimes viewed as a unique process
                                               comprising co-coordinated and controlled activities and composed
                                               of activities from the Technical Management and Technical
                                               Processes defined in this document.
 protection needs                              Informal statement or expression of the stakeholder security
                                               requirements focused on protecting information, systems,
                                               and services associated with mission/business functions
                                               throughout the system life cycle.
                                               Note: Requirements elicitation and security analyses transform the
                                               protection needs into a formalized statement of stakeholder
                                               security requirements that are managed as part of the validated

                                               health and safety, and environmental goals) and can apply at
                                               different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project,
                                               product and process).
                                               Note 3: Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events
                                               and consequences, or a combination of these.
                                               Note 4: Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the
                                               consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and
                                               the associated likelihood of occurrence.
                                               Note 5: Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of
                                               information related to understanding or knowledge of an event, its

 risk tolerance                                The organization or stakeholder’s readiness to bear the risk
 [ISO 73]                                      after risk treatment in order to achieve its objectives.
                                               Note: Risk tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory
                                               requirements.

 security                                      Freedom from those conditions that can cause loss of assets
                                               with unacceptable consequences.

 security architecture                         A set of physical and logical security-relevant representations
                                               (i.e., views) of system architecture that conveys information
                                               about how the system is partitioned into security domains
                                               and makes use of security-relevant elements to enforce
                                               security policies within and between security domains based
                                               on how data and information must be protected.
                                               Note: The security architecture reflects security domains, the
                                               placement of security-relevant elements within the security
                                               domains, the interconnections and trust relationships between the
                                               security-relevant elements, and the behavior and interactions
                                               between the security-relevant elements. The security architecture,
                                               similar to the system architecture, may be expressed at various
                                               levels of abstraction and with different scopes.
 security domain                               Set of assets and resources subject to a common security
 [ISO 19989]                                   policy.
                                               Note: A security domain is defined by rules (policy) for users,
                                               processes, systems, and services that apply to activity within the
                                               domain and activity with similar entities in other domains.

 security function                             The capability provided by the system or a system element.
                                               The capability may be expressed generally as a concept or
                                               specified precisely in requirements.

 security policy                               A set of rules that governs all aspects of security-relevant
                                               system and system element behavior.
                                               Note 1: System elements include technology, machine, and human,
                                               elements.
                                               Note 2: Rules can be stated at high levels of abstraction (e.g., an
                                               organizational policy that defines the acceptable behavior of
                                               employees in performing their mission/business functions) or at low
                                               levels of abstraction (e.g., an operating system policy that defines
                                               the acceptable behavior of executing processes and use of
                                               resources by those processes).
 security relevance                            The functions or constraints that are relied upon to, directly
                                               or indirectly, to meet protection needs.
                                               Note: the term security relevance has been used to differentiate the
                                               role of system functions that singularly or in combination, exhibit
                                               behavior, produce an outcome, or provide a capability to enforce
                                               authorized and intended system behavior or outcomes.
 security requirement                          A requirement that has security relevance.
 security risk                                 The effect of uncertainty on objectives pertaining to asset
 [ISO 73 adapted]                              loss and the associated consequences.
                                               Note: [ISO 73] defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives.
                                               Furthermore, risk can be either positive or negative.
 security service                              A security capability or function provided by an entity.
 security specification                        The requirements for the security-relevant portion of the
                                               system.
                                               Note: The security specification may be provided as a separate
                                               document or may be captured with a broader specification.
 self-protection                               The protection provided by an entity to ensure its own
                                               correct behavior and function despite adversity.
                                               Note: While ideally, an entity would be able to provide all the self-
                                               protection necessary, in practice entities are limited in the extent
                                               they can provide for their own protection without depending on
                                               one or more other entities.
 service                                       Performance of activities, work, or duties.
 [ISO 15288]                                   Note 1: A service is self-contained, coherent, discrete, and can be
                                               composed of other services.
                                               Note 2: A service is generally an intangible product.
 situational awareness                         Perception of elements in the system and/or environment
 [ISO 17757 adapted]                           and a comprehension of their meaning, which could include a
                                               projection of the future status of perceived elements and the
                                               uncertainty associated with that status.

                                               Note 1: As used in this document, stages relate to major progress
                                               and achievement milestones of the entity through its life cycle.

 strength of function                          Criterion expressing the minimum efforts assumed necessary
                                               to defeat the specified security behavior of an implemented
                                               security function by directly attacking its underlying security
                                               mechanisms.
                                               Note 1: Strength of function has as a prerequisite that assumes that
                                               the underlying security mechanisms are correctly implemented. The
                                               concept of strength of functions may be equally applied to services
                                               or other capability-based abstraction provided by security
                                               mechanisms.
                                               Note 2: The term robustness combines the concepts of assurance of
                                               correct implementation with strength of function to provide finer

 susceptibility                                The inability to avoid adversity.
 supplier                                      Organization or an individual that enters into an agreement
 [ISO 15288]                                   with the acquirer for the supply of a product or service.
                                               Note 1: Other terms commonly used for supplier are contractor,
                                               producer, seller, or vendor.
                                               Note 2: The acquirer and the supplier sometimes are part of the

                                               Note 2: In practice, the interpretation of its meaning is frequently
                                               clarified by the use of an associative noun (e.g., aircraft system).
                                               Alternatively, the word “system” is substituted simply by a context-
                                               dependent synonym (e.g., aircraft), though this potentially obscures
                                               a system principles perspective).
                                               Note 3: A complete system includes all associated equipment,

 system security requirement                   System requirement that has security relevance. System
                                               security requirements define the protection capabilities
                                               provided by the system, the performance and behavioral
                                               characteristics exhibited by the system, and the evidence
                                               used to determine that the system security requirements
                                               have been satisfied.
                                               Note 1: Due to the complexity of system security, system security
                                               requirements have several types and purposes including: (1)
                                               structural security requirements that express the passive aspects of
                                               the protection capability provided by the system architecture, and
                                               (2) functional security requirements that express the active aspects
                                               of the protection capability provided by the engineered features
                                               and devices (e.g., security mechanisms, inhibits, controls,
                                               safeguards, overrides, and countermeasures).
                                               Note 2: Each system security requirement is expressed in a manner
                                               that makes verification possible via analysis, observation, test,
                                               inspection, measurement, or other defined and achievable means.

 threat                                        Potential cause of unacceptable asset loss and the
                                               undesirable consequences or impact of such a loss.
                                               Note: The specific causes of asset loss, and for which the
                                               consequences of asset loss are assessed, can arise from a variety of
                                               conditions and events related to adversity, typically referred to as
                                               disruptions, hazards, or threats. Regardless of the specific term
                                               used, the basis of asset loss constitutes all forms of intentional,
                                               unintentional, accidental, incidental, misuse, abuse, error,
                                               weakness, defect, fault, and/or failure events and associated
                                               conditions.
 traceability                                  Discernible association among two or more logical entities,
 [ISO 29110-1]                                 such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or
                                               tasks.
 traceability analysis                         The analysis of the relationships between two or more
                                               products of the development process conducted to
                                               determine that objectives have been met or that the effort
                                               represented by the products is completed.
                                               Note: A requirements traceability analysis demonstrates that all
                                               system security requirements have been traced to and are justified
                                               by at least one stakeholder security requirement, and that each
                                               stakeholder security requirement is satisfied by at least one system
                                               security requirement.
 traceability matrix                           A matrix that records the relationship between two or more
 [IEEE 610.12]                                 products of the development process (e.g., a matrix that
                                               records the relationship between the requirements and the
                                               design of a given software component).
                                               Note 1: A traceability matrix can record the relationship between a
                                               set of requirements and one or more products of the development
                                               process and can be used to demonstrate completeness and
                                               coverage of an activity or analysis based upon the requirements
                                               contained in the matrix.
                                               Note 2: A traceability matrix may be conveyed as a set of matrices
                                               representing requirements at different levels of decomposition.
                                               Such a traceability matrix enables the tracing of requirements
                                               stated in their most abstract form (e.g., statement of stakeholder
                                               requirements) through decomposition steps that result in the
                                               implementation that satisfies the requirements.
 trade-off                                     Decision-making actions that select from various
 [ISO 15288]                                   requirements and alternative solutions on the basis of net
                                               benefit to the stakeholders.
 trade-off analysis                            Determining the effect of decreasing one or more key factors
                                               and simultaneously increasing one or more other key factors
                                               in a decision, design, or project.

 trust                                         A belief that an entity meets certain expectations and
 [MITRE21]                                     therefore can be relied upon.
                                               Note: The term belief implies that trust may be granted to an entity
                                               whether the entity is trustworthy or not.
 trust relationship                            An agreed upon relationship between two or more system
                                               elements that is governed by criteria for secure interaction,
                                               behavior, and outcomes relative to the protection of assets.
                                               Note: This refers to trust relationships between system elements
                                               implemented by hardware, firmware, and software.
 trustworthiness                               Worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever critical
 [Neumann04]                                   requirements may be needed for a particular component,
                                               subsystem, system, network, application, mission, enterprise,
                                               or other entity.
                                               Note: From a security perspective, a trustworthy system is a system
                                               that meets specific security requirements in addition to meeting
                                               other critical requirements.
 trustworthy                                   The degree to which the behavior of a component is

1285   APPENDIX C

1286   SECURITY POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS
1287   FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR THE EXPRESSION OF TRUSTWORTHY SECURE SYSTEM CAPABILITY

1288   This appendix discusses security requirements and security policy considerations 55 in support of
1289   Appendix D, Appendix E, and Appendix H. Covered topics include the rules and scope of control
1290   for security policy (Section C.1), stakeholder and system security requirements (Section C.2), and
1291   the relationship among security requirements, policy, and mechanisms (Section C.3).

1292   C.1 SECURITY POLICY
1293   A security policy is a set of rules (Section C.1.1) that governs behavior and outcomes within a
1294   defined scope of control (Section C.1.2). The policy generally includes a set of policies that reflect
1295   the needs and expectations established by an authority with a specific scope and purpose (Section
1296   C.1.2). The policy rules have a hierarchy, from security policy top-level objectives that are refined
1297   and allocated to organizational security policies, which in turn are refined and allocated to system
1298   security policies.

1299   C.1.1 Rules
1300   Security policy rules are stated in terms of authorized relationships that involve subjects (i.e.,
1301   active entities) and objects (i.e., passive entities). The rules govern the operations that a subject
1302   can perform or invoke on other subjects (i.e., subject-to-subject operations) and the operations
1303   that a subject can perform or invoke on objects (i.e., subject-to-object operations). The rules must
1304   be accurate, consistent, compatible, and complete with respect to stakeholder security objectives
1305   within the defined scope of control. Inaccurate, inconsistent, incompatible, or incomplete rule
1306   sets will allow undesired behavior and outcomes.

1307   C.1.2 Scope of Control
1308   Security policies reflect and are derived from laws, directives, regulations, life cycle concepts, 56
1309   requirements, or stakeholder objectives. Each includes a scope of control that establishes the
1310   bounds within which the policy applies. A typical scope of applicability includes:
1311   •    Security Policy (Protection) Objectives: A set of objectives that captures a preferred state or
1312        what is to be achieved. These objectives include assets to be protected, statements of intent
1313        to protect the assets within the specific scope of stakeholder responsibility, and protection
1314        scope. Security policy objectives are the basis for deriving all other security policy forms.
1315   •    Organizational Security Policy: A set of rules 57 that regulates how an organization achieves
1316        its objectives. The rules provide individuals with a reasonable ability to determine whether
1317        their actions either violate or comply with the security policy. Organizational security policy
1318        defines the individual’s behavior in performing their missions and business functions and is
1319        used for the developing processes and procedures.

       55 This appendix discusses policy in a manner that suggests policy precedes engineering. However, policy may need to

       be modified to align with the capabilities of the delivered as-is system.
       56 Life cycle concepts include operation, sustainment, evolution, maintenance, training, startup, and shutdown.

       57 The rules may be captured in laws and practices.

1320   •    System Security Policy: A policy that specifies the system security capability. It is the set of
1321        restrictions and properties that specifies how a system enforces or contributes to enforcing
1322        organizational security policy.
1323   •    Personnel Security Policy: A policy that defines the expectations of personnel. 58 These include
1324        behaviors of the personnel using or sustaining the system.

1325   Security policy goes through an iterative refinement process that decomposes an abstract
1326   statement of security policy into more specific statements of security policy. The refinement
1327   occurs in parallel with requirements allocation and decomposition. Figure C-1 illustrates security
1328   policy allocation across the organization.

1332   C.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1333   A requirement is a statement that translates or expresses a specific need and its associated
1334   constraints and conditions [ISO 29148]. 59 Security requirements translate or express protection
1335   needs (Section 3.7), associated constraints, and associated conditions. The constraints also reflect
1336   concerns about the system functions, system architecture, and design to ensure that they are
1337   specified in a manner that avoids and reduces susceptibilities, defects, flaws, and weaknesses
1338   (Section 3.8) and is consistent with the needs of active security functions.

1339   Requirements can be categorized as: (1) stakeholder requirements that address the need to be
1340   satisfied in a design-independent manner, and (2) system requirements that express the specific


       58 These expectations often cover personnel actions that may expose them to negative external influences (e.g., certain

       social media use).
       59 General requirements and definition processes are described in sources such as [ISO 29148] and [INCOSE20].

1345   Security requirements and security-relevant constraints and conditions on other requirements
1346   are informed by various items, such as those pictured in Figure C-3.

1347   C.2.1 Stakeholder Security Requirements
1348   Stakeholder security requirements are those stakeholder requirements that are security relevant.
1349   Stakeholder security requirements specify:
1350   •    The protection needed for the mission or business, data, information, processes, functions,
1351        humans, and system assets
1352   •    The roles, responsibilities, and security-relevant actions of individuals who perform and
1353        support the mission or business processes
1354   •    The interactions between the security-relevant solution elements
1355   •    The assurance that is to be obtained in the security solution
1356   Systems security considerations within activities and tasks such as those described in Appendices
1357   H, I, J, and K provide the security perspective to ensure that stakeholder security requirements

1362   C.2.2 System Security Requirements
1363   System requirements specify the technical view of a system or solution that meets the specified
1364   stakeholder needs. The system requirements are a transformation of the validated stakeholder
1365   requirements. System requirements specify what the system or solution must do to satisfy the
1366   stakeholder requirements. System security requirements are those system requirements that are
1367   security relevant. These requirements define:
1368   •         The protection capabilities provided by the security solution
1369   •         The performance and behavioral characteristics exhibited by the security solution
1370   •         Assurance processes, procedures, and techniques
1371   •         Constraints on the system and the processes, methods, and tools used to realize the system
1372   •         The evidence required to determine the system security requirements have been satisfied 60
1373


       60 Each system security requirement, like any system requirement, is expressed in a manner that makes verification

       possible via inspection, analysis, demonstration, testing, or other defined and achievable means [ISO 29148].

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


1374   Due to the complexity of system security, system security requirements have several types and
1375   purposes including: (1) structural security requirements that express the passive aspects of the
1376   protection capability provided primarily by the system architecture, and (2) functional security
1377   requirements that express the active aspects of the protection capability provided by engineered
1378   features and devices (e.g., security mechanisms, controls, safeguards, inhibits, overrides, and
1379   countermeasures). Decomposition of the system security requirements is accomplished as part
1380   of the system requirements decomposition and is consistent with the different levels of
1381   hierarchical abstraction and forms of the system requirements.
1382


                                     SYSTEM STATES, POLICY, AND REQUIREMENTS
             Systems operate in secure, insecure, and indeterminant states (Section 3.2). System security
             policy and system requirements account for these states and the state transitions, including
             those reflecting the design principles of Protective Failure and Protective Recovery. For example,
             requirements capture needs to: (1) detect insecure system states, (2) detect a transition that
             will result in a insecure state, (3) transition to a secure halt state, (4) recover to a reconstituted,
             reconfigured, or alternative secure operational mode, and (5) if necessary, continue operating
             in insecure or indeterminant states when other needs override protection needs.

1385   C.3 DISTINGUISHING REQUIREMENTS, POLICY, AND MECHANISMS
1386   The terms requirements, policy, and mechanisms are often used in an abstract manner that allows
1387   them to be considered as synonyms. However, when these terms are used in the context of
1388   engineering trustworthy secure systems, they are distinct in their meaning and importance to
1389   specifying, realizing, utilizing, and sustaining systems.

1390   The security policy states the behavior that is necessary to achieve a secure condition, whereas a
1391   security mechanism is a means to achieve the necessary behavior. The distinction between
1392   security policy and security mechanism extends to differentiating security requirements from
1393   security policy. Security requirements specify the capability, behavior, and quality attributes
1394   exhibited and possessed by security mechanisms as well as constraints on each. Security policy
1395   specifies how the security mechanisms must behave in an operational context and the constraints
1396   on those behaviors. From the system standpoint, a human is a system element and may serve as
1397   a security mechanism. Therefore, the human is expected to behave as stated by relevant security
1398   policy and security requirements.

1399   Requirements, policies, and mechanisms have an important dependency relationship. System
1400   security requirements specify the capabilities and behaviors that a security mechanism can
1401   provide. A security policy specifies the aspects that a mechanism must enforce to achieve
1402   organizational objectives. This means that a secure system cannot be achieved if the security
1403   requirements do not fully specify the minimal capability necessary to enforce the security policy.
1404   It also means that the satisfaction of requirements alone does not result in a secure system.
1405   Verification and validation activities must be done separately and coordinated to ensure the
1406   individual and combined correctness and effectiveness of the requirements and policy.

1409
1410              FIGURE C-4: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MECHANISMS AND SECURITY POLICY ENFORCEMENT

1411   Any security mechanism that fully satisfies its system security requirements may be deemed
1412   capable of enforcing the security policy that is defined for two different organizations. Each
1413   organization will use the same mechanism and configure it to behave in a manner that enforces
1414   the rules of their organizational security policy. However, if the organizations were to switch
1415   mechanisms and keep the same configuration of the mechanism, they would achieve uncertain
1416   results (unless their security policy objectives required the exact same configuration of the
1417   mechanism). From this, the following conclusions may be drawn:
1418   •    Requirements express both the security protections to be provided by security mechanisms
1419        and the security-informed constraints to be enforced by security mechanisms.
1420   •    Security policy determines the behavior and outcomes that are deemed “secure.”
1421   •    For a mechanism to be deemed secure, the mechanism’s capability requirements must be
1422        consistent with security policy enforcement rules; the mechanism must satisfy the security
1423        requirements; and the mechanism must be configured to behave in a manner defined by the
1424        organizational security policy.

1426   TRUSTWORTHY SECURE DESIGN
1427   FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR THE TRUSTWORTHY SECURE DESIGN OF SYSTEMS

1428   This appendix discusses the approach and considerations for applying technical 61 elements of a
1429   trustworthy secure system design. This includes the system’s authorized and intended behaviors
1430   and outcomes (Section D.2), the security design order of precedence (Section D.3), and the
1431   functional design and trade space considerations (Section D.4).

1432   Trustworthiness must have a principled and effective system design. The principles (Appendix E)
1433   provide a sound basis for reasoning about a system and enable the demonstration of system
1434   trustworthiness through assurance based on relevant and credible evidence. Applying principles
1435   and concepts should be planned for, appropriately scoped, and revisited throughout the system
1436   life cycle and engineering effort. Trustworthy secure design concepts described in this appendix
1437   provide a balanced and integrated approach that optimally protects against asset loss.

1438   Other enablers for trustworthy secure design include elements such as standards, specifications,
1439   design patterns, security policy models, functional behaviors and interactions, security protocols,
1440   defined strength of mechanisms, cryptographic algorithms, known adversities, and assumptions
1441   of uncertainty including with adversity. Appendix F provides a more in-depth discussion of the
1442   concepts of trustworthiness and assurance.

                                                 TRUSTWORTHY SECURE DESIGN
             Trustworthy secure design is a means to optimally provide stakeholders with the confidence
             that their conflicting capability needs, concerns, priorities, and constraints are satisfied.

1447   maintain the ability to deliver system capabilities at an acceptable level of performance 62 while
1448   minimizing the occurrence and extent of loss. This approach provides a system structure for
1449   optimal employment of the tactical engineered features and devices. 63 The system design must
1450   provide the intended behaviors and outcomes, avoid the unintended behaviors and outcomes,

       61 Note that human factor elements of trust are not discussed. A system may be trustworthy, but a user may not trust

       it. Similarly, a user may trust an untrustworthy system.
       62 An acceptable level of performance lies between the minimum threshold of acceptability and the objective of

       maximum performance. This level may vary across operational or system states and modes (e.g., patrolling in clear
       weather versus severe weather conditions), may vary across contingency conditions (e.g., normal, degraded), and may
       be subject to operational priorities (e.g., search and rescue, manhunt).
       63 The term tactics refers to specific means to accomplish an action. Tactics focus on how to accomplish the action (e.g.,

       using engineered features and devices to react to a threat). This contrasts with the term strategy, which takes a broader
       view and focuses on what to accomplish (e.g., a design approach for trustworthy secure systems) [Young14].

1451   prevent loss, and limit loss when it occurs. A trustworthy secure design includes a situational
1452   awareness capability and a margin 64 to account for the unknowns and uncertainty inherent in the
1453   system and its operational environment, as well as related adversity. The situational awareness
1454   capability should also enable accountability for the actions of all users and entities (i.e., audit)
1455   while detecting pending and actual failure (e.g., by crossing the threshold of the margins that have
1456   been established). The design principle of Anomaly Detection embodies this capability.

1457   The design approach includes the following elements: 65
1458   •    Define the intended behaviors and outcomes for the system 66
1459   •    Identify the system states and conditions that reflect the intended behaviors and outcomes
1460   •    Identify the system states and conditions that potentially lead to loss in the system
1461   •    Engineer to prevent loss to the extent practicable (preferred) and limit the loss that does
1462        occur (where, when, and to the extent necessary and practicable)
1463   •    Iterate the above elements to address how the functions that serve to prevent or limit loss
1464        may fail due to intentional or unintentional reasons

1466   Engineering Framework described in Chapter Four.

1478   D.2 DESIGN FOR BEHAVIORS AND OUTCOMES
1479   A system should deliver the required intended capability at a specified level of performance when
1480   authorized. However, a system may also deliver an unauthorized or unintended capability. The


       64 The term margin refers to a spare amount, measure, or degree allowed or given for contingencies or special

       situations. The allowances are carried to account for uncertainties and risks. Two types of margins are used in systems
       engineering: design margin and operational margin. See the design principle of Loss Margins.
       65 These steps are useful in applying a system control concept for any loss-relevant emergent property (e.g., safety,

       resilience).
       66 This flow iterates through systems engineering as the system is decomposed. Subsequent iterations would apply

       within the elements that comprise the system of interest (i.e., the subsystems, assemblies, and components).

       APPENDIX D                                                                                                          PAGE 81

1481   design goal is to provide only authorized and intended capability, accomplished by achieving only
1482   authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes.

1483   One cause of unintended behaviors and outcomes lies with the concept of emergence. Emergence
1484   refers to the behaviors and outcomes that result from how individual system elements compose
1485   to form the system. That is, the behaviors and outcomes produced by the system are not those
1486   of the individual system elements that form the system. Rather, the emergent system behaviors
1487   and outcomes, or system properties, result from the composition of multiple system elements.
1488   This composition is covered in the design principle of Structured Decomposition and Composition
1489   and illustrated in Figure 2.

1490   Some emergent system properties sought are desired and productive; other emergent properties
1491   are not desired or productive. Such properties can produce unknown, unforeseen, or adverse
1492   effects. Engineering trustworthy secure systems seeks to deliver only the desired and productive
1493   emergent properties. Trustworthiness judgments are based on the expectation that the system
1494   can satisfy the stated capability needs. To achieve this, the design must address emergence at all
1495   levels of system abstraction in terms of how the system is decomposed into its constituent
1496   elements and how those system elements compose to produce the system. This is covered in the
1497   design principle of Compositional Trustworthiness.

1499
1500
1501                                 SECURITY AS AN EMERGENT SYSTEM PROPERTY
1502         The objective of security as an emergent system property is to achieve only the authorized and
1503         intended system behaviors and outcomes. This requires a fundamental understanding of how
1504         individual system elements are composed into the system as a whole. Systems are designed from
1505         that basis of understanding to limit the emergent behaviors and outcomes that are not specified
1506         (including desired unspecified and undesired unspecified behaviors and outcomes).
1507
1508
1509
1510   Both proactive and reactive aspects are considered in an integrated, comprehensive engineering
1511   approach. These mutually reinforcing aspects provide the protection needed to achieve only the
1512   authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes. The proactive aspect results in system features
1513   and system actions taken to prevent and limit loss before the loss occurs, while the reactive aspect
1514   results in system actions to limit loss and its effects once a loss has occurred.

1515   The proactive aspect recognizes the conditions where loss may occur and addresses the scenarios
1516   before loss occurs (i.e., what can happen). If the loss does occur, the results are limited due to
1517   system features and actions taken in advance. The proactive aspect is independent of any specific
1518   knowledge of attacks and attacker objectives, instead focusing on what is possible in the system’s
1519   life cycle. The reactive aspect recognizes the limits of certainty about what can happen, and that
1520   new, unanticipated, and otherwise unforeseen adverse consequences will occur despite the
1521   proactive planning and instituting of means and methods to control loss and the extent of its
1522   consequences. The reactive aspect promotes informed operational decision-making after the
1523   system is in use and a loss condition occurs, proactively giving operations the ability to address
1524   the loss condition and handle the loss. The reactive aspect complements the proactive aspect by
1525   providing an informed basis and means for an external entity (e.g., a human operator or system)

       APPENDIX D                                                                                         PAGE 82

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


1526   to act when failures occur. Essentially, the reactive aspect is a proactive engineering activity about
1527   providing a reactive capability.

1528   An effective design will optimize protection against loss to the extent practical, while recognizing
1529   that losses will occur irrespective of the protections put in place. Optimization decisions across
1530   proactive and reactive approaches must consider assets, stakeholders, concerns, and objectives.
1531   Achieving a proper mix requires establishing security objectives and conducting requirements
1532   elicitation and analysis to unambiguously and clearly ascertain the scope of security in terms of
1533   addressing failure and the associated consequences in its proactive and reactive aspects. Figure
1534   D-2 illustrates a balanced design strategy.

1574   D.3 SECURITY DESIGN ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
                                                                    67
1575   The security design order of precedence (SecDOP) is a design approach with the objective of
1576   minimizing the design basis for loss potential. SecDOP emphasizes the use of architectural
1577   features to provide the structure for implementing engineered features and devices. Using a
1578   principled and assured engineering approach, the SecDOP eliminates susceptibility, hazard, and
1579   vulnerability to the extent practicable, thereby eliminating the associated risk. For those cases in
1580   which susceptibility, hazard, or vulnerability cannot be eliminated, the SecDOP reduces the loss
1581   potential (e.g., occurrence, impact) to the lowest acceptable level within the constraints of cost,
1582   schedule, and performance. The SecDOP approach applies design options in order of decreasing
1583   effectiveness, thus enabling a maximized return on investment.

1584   The SecDOP options are:
1585   1. Eliminate the potential for loss through design selection.
1586        Susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability are eliminated by selecting a design or material
1587        alternative that completely removes susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability and thus
1588        prevents loss.
1589        Example: The design selected for a system function of interest minimizes the number of
1590        interfaces to other systems (i.e., external interfaces) and the number of internal interfaces.
1591        The minimization of interfaces (both external and internal) is determined considering the
1592        interface needs of all system functions and results in an across-the-board optimization that
1593        does not overly constrain the design for the system function of interest. That is, the design
1594        results in less susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability than a design that incorporates
1595        additional and unnecessary internal and external interfaces.
1596        Note: The design selection to control loss is accomplished to accommodate the need for
1597        mechanisms that provide mediated access and trusted communication as these engineered
1598        features and devices are necessary for a secure system.
1599   2. Reduce the potential for loss through design alteration.
1600        If adopting an alternative design or material to eliminate susceptibility, hazard, and
1601        vulnerability is not feasible, consider design changes or material selection that would reduce
1602        the frequency, potential, severity, and/or extent of loss caused by the susceptibility, hazard,
1603        or vulnerability.
1604        Example: The selected design for the system function of interest has susceptibility, hazard,
1605        and vulnerability due to the system-level design trades made to satisfy the requirements for
1606        all system functions, emergence, and the limits of certainty. In response to these conditions,
1607        the design might consider functional domains, defense-in-depth layering, redundancy, and
1608        other approaches to further reduce susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability.
1609        Note: The design alteration to control loss is accomplished to accommodate the need for
1610        mechanisms that provide mediated access and trusted communication, as these engineered
1611        features and devices are necessary for a secure system.



       67 The security design order of precedence is inspired by the System Safety Design Order of Precedence, an optimized

       design approach for system safety described in [MILSTD-882E].


       APPENDIX D                                                                                                  PAGE 84

1612   3. Incorporate engineered features or devices to control the potential for loss.
1613        If preventing, limiting, or reducing the potential for loss through design alteration and
1614        material selection is not feasible or adequate, employ engineered features and devices to
1615        control loss associated with susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability. In general, engineered
1616        features actively disrupt the loss scenario sequence and interactions, and devices reduce the
1617        potential, severity, and extent of loss.
1618        Two general types of engineered features and devices employed to address the potential for
1619        loss associated with the system function of interest are:
1620        -     Mandatory security features and devices: Mandatory security features and devices are
1621              those that apply foundational security principles for the interfaces. For example, each
1622              interface must have mediated access to control access to and use of the capability and
1623              data provided by the interface.
1624        -     Function-specific features and devices: Function-specific security features and devices
1625              protect against a loss associated with the design’s ability to meet functional requirements
1626              and performance parameters. Engineered features such as redundant data and control
1627              flows and redundant system elements can supplement the design selection to achieve
1628              the required protection. The system may also have engineered features that enable
1629              external entities to intervene into the system to address the potential, severity, or extent
1630              of loss.
1631   4. Provide visibility and feedback to external entities.
1632        If design alteration, material selection, and engineered features and devices are not feasible
1633        or do not adequately lower the frequency, potential, severity, or extent of loss caused by the
1634        susceptibility, hazard, or vulnerability, employ engineered detection and feedback systems
1635        and warning devices to alert external entities to the presence of a susceptible, hazardous, or
1636        vulnerable condition; the occurrence of an event that will lead to a loss; or an actual loss
1637        event. External entities include operational personnel, monitoring systems, or other systems
1638        capable of responding.
1639        Example: Anomaly detection features can be used to provide situational awareness data and
1640        warnings to system users.
1641        Note: The visibility provided is not of value if the external entities are not able to respond
1642        appropriately. For example, personnel should have proper training and standard operating
1643        procedures for loss.
1644   5. Incorporate signage, procedures, training, and proper equipment.
1645        Incorporate procedures, training, signage, and proper equipment where design alternatives,
1646        design changes, and engineered features and devices are not feasible and warning devices
1647        cannot adequately lessen the potential, severity, or extent of loss caused by the hazard,
1648        susceptibility, or vulnerability. Procedures and training include proper warnings and cautions
1649        and may prescribe the use of equipment. For critical losses, the use of signage, procedures,
1650        training, and equipment as the only means to reduce the potential, severity, or extent of loss
1651        should be avoided.
1652        Example: Procedures and training address proper use of the system function of interest, as
1653        well as the use of mediated access functions, redundant capabilities, and warning systems,
1654        including all relevant cautions and warnings.

             [Snyder15] postulates that “poor systems security engineering is very difficult to mitigate by
             overlaying security controls, whereas security controls overlaid on a sound, secure design can
             be quite effective.”
             The Security Design Order of Precedence as part of systems security engineering practice, frames
             a proper integration of technical controls (SecDOP #3) and operational controls (SecDOP #5).

1658   D.4 FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
1659   This section describes the functional design considerations for trustworthy secure systems. These
1660   considerations include: (1) assured functions that provide control enforcement, control decision,
1661   and control infrastructure, (2) design criteria for mechanisms, (3) security function failure analysis,
1662   (4) situational awareness, and (5) trade space considerations.

1663   D.4.1 Roles for Security-Relevant Control
1664   All functions have the potential to influence behaviors and outcomes beyond themselves and
1665   their host system elements and are relevant to security. 68 However, some functions are specific
1666   to the security capabilities of the system, such as supporting enterprise audit capabilities. A key
1667   set that contributes to these capabilities is the protection control function.
1668   Protection control functions enforce or contribute to the control of or otherwise directly influence
1669   system or system element behaviors and outcomes. These functions may be characterized and
1670   analyzed by using the following designations:
1671   •    Protection Control Decision Functions: These functions make authorization decisions or take
1672        other actions for protection control enforcement functions. For example, a function that
1673        decides to grant or deny access to a resource based on a request (e.g., from a protection
1674        control enforcement function).
1675   •    Protection Control Enforcement Functions: These functions enforce a constraint to ensure
1676        that the system or system element exhibits only authorized and intended behaviors or
1677        outcomes. For example, a protection control enforcement function enforces a decision to
1678        grant or deny access to a resource.
1679   •    Protection Control Infrastructure Functions: These functions support and help protection
1680        control enforcement and control decision functions fulfill their purposes. The functions also
1681        provide data or services or perform operations upon which protection control enforcement
1682        and decision functions depend. For example, a protection control infrastructure function
1683        includes secure storage, secure communication, and anomaly detection mechanisms.


       68 Historically, the term security relevance has been used in secure system design and evaluation to differentiate the

       role of system functions that either singularly or in combination, exhibit a behavior, produce an outcome, or provide a
       capability to enforce authorized and intended system behaviors or outcomes. However, from the security perspective
       (Section 3.8) and the possibility of loss due to weaknesses and defects in any system function, all functions have loss-
       related concerns and, thus, protection concerns.

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


1684   Other functions, including control functions for other purposes besides protection, can potentially
1685   adversely affect the correct operation of the protection control functions. For the purposes of
1686   secure design and evaluation, the functions are designated other system functions. Ideally, these
1687   functions should be non-interfering. This non-interference objective may be achieved through
1688   assurance with constraints on the requirements, architecture, design, and use of these functions.

1689   System functions can be mapped to one or more protection control decisions, protection control
1690   enforcement, protection control infrastructure, or other for the purpose of secure design and
1691   evaluation. The distinction guides and informs a principled design to limit interference among
1692   functions with confidence. Such confidence can be achieved by employing Trustworthy System
1693   Control, applying the design criteria described in Section D.4.2, and optimally placing a function
1694   in the system architecture to limit the side effects and interactions that may interfere with the
1695   protection control functions.

1696   System analyses can determine the extent to which functions may interfere with other functions,
1697   including identifying any uncertainty that impacts confidence and needed actions for assurance.
1698   For example, to satisfy a size or form-factor constraint, a system function may occupy the same
1699   privilege domain as control enforcement, control decision, or control infrastructure functions,
1700   thereby elevating the privilege of that system function. If the size or form-factor constraint does
1701   not exist, it would be prudent to allocate that system function elsewhere to avoid giving the
1702   function elevated privilege. This would increase the assurance that the enforcement, decision,
1703   and infrastructure functions are isolated from the other parts of the system and would not be
1704   adversely impacted by their behavior or provide an avenue for attack.

1705   D.4.2 Essential Design Criteria for Mechanisms
1706   To effectively achieve the objectives of trustworthy secure design, mechanisms (i.e., engineered
1707   features and devices) must satisfy four essential design criteria. They must be non-bypassable,
1708   evaluatable, always invoked, and tamper-proof [Uchenick05]. Generally, a design for any control
1709   function that provides protection should adhere to these criteria. 69 Table D-1 briefly describes the
1710   essential design criteria.

1711                                 TABLE D-1: ESSENTIAL DESIGN CRITERIA FOR MECHANISMS

        ESSENTIAL DESIGN
                                                                        DESCRIPTION
            CRITERIA

        NON-BYPASSABLE             The mechanism must not be circumventable.

        EVALUATABLE                The mechanism must be sufficiently small and simple enough to be assessed to produce
                                   adequate confidence in the protection provided, the constraint (or control objective)
                                   enforced, and the correct implementation of the mechanism. The assessment includes the
                                   analysis and testing needed.

        ALWAYS INVOLKED            The protection provided by a mechanism or feature that is not always invoked is not
                                   continuous and therefore, a loss may occur while the mechanism or feature is suspended
                                   or turned off.


       69 The argument that any control function should be non-bypassable, evaluatable, always invoked, and tamper-proof

       follows from an in-depth examination of Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) as described in [Leveson11],
       specifically the discussions on why controls may fail and how to address failure.

           ESSENTIAL DESIGN
                                                                       DESCRIPTION
               CRITERIA

           TAMPER-PROOF            The mechanism or feature and the data that the mechanism or feature depends on cannot
                                   be modified in an unauthorized manner.


1712
1713   The design criteria described above are based on the generalized reference monitor concept. The
1714   reference monitor concept 70 is an abstract model of the necessary and sufficient properties that
1715   must be achieved by any mechanism that performs an access mediation control function [Levin07]
1716   [Anderson72]. The reference monitor concept is a foundational access control concept for assured
1717   system design. It is defined as a trustworthy abstract machine that mediates all accesses to objects
1718   by subjects [TCSEC85]. As a concept for an abstract machine, the reference monitor does not
1719   address any specific implementation. A reference validation mechanism, which includes a
1720   combination of hardware and software, realizes the reference monitor concept to provide the
1721   access mediation foundation for a trustworthy secure system.

1722   The generalized reference monitor concept and the four essential design criteria can be used
1723   effectively as the design basis for individual system elements, collections of elements, networks,
1724   and systems where intentional and unintentional adversity can prevent the realization of a loss
1725   control objective. The reference monitor concept also drives the need for rigor in engineering
1726   activities commensurate with the trust to be placed in the system or its constituent system
1727   elements. 71 The concept describes an abstract model of the necessary properties that must be
1728   realized by any mechanism that claims to achieve a constraint or set of constraints and the basis
1729   for determining the extent to which the properties are satisfied. A mechanism that achieves
1730   successful constraint has two parts: (1) a means to decide whether to constrain or not constrain;
1731   and (2) the enforcement of the decision. Enforcement of the decision must sufficiently:
1732   •     Enforce constraints to achieve only the authorized and intended system behaviors and
1733         outcomes
1734   •     Provide self-protection against targeted attacks on the mechanism enforcing the decision
1735         (including applying the essential design criteria)
1736   •     Be absent of self-induced emergent, erroneous, unsafe, and non-assured control actions

1737   The protection characteristics for mechanisms must account for but not be dependent on having
1738   detailed knowledge of the capability, means, and methods of an adversary.

1739   D.4.3 Security Function Failure Analysis
1740   The design principle of Protective Failure states that a failure of a particular system element
1741   should neither result in an unacceptable loss nor invoke another loss scenario. The failure of a
1742   security function is of special concern, given the need for security functions to always be invoked
1743   and operating correctly. Consequently, failure analyses must be performed during system design


       70 The reference monitor concept is described in the Trustworthy System Control principle in Appendix E.

       71 Conceptually, the reference monitor concept can be extended to any control function that is to enforce a system

       constraint [MITRE21].

1744   to determine the impacts of function failure on the system capabilities, including the protection
1745   capability relative to the resulting consequences of such failure and the needed assurance of the
1746   protection capability.

1747   Failure analyses consider the assets that may be impacted by security function failure and the
1748   associated loss consequences. Failure analyses also consider the function allocation to system
1749   elements and the way the system function and element combination interacts with other system
1750   function and element combinations, independent of specific events and conditions that might
1751   lead to the failure. The principles for trustworthy secure design in Appendix E serve to guide and
1752   inform the analyses.

1753   The outcomes of the security function failure analyses also drive assurance levels and objectives,
1754   as well as the fidelity and rigor of architecture, design, and implementation methods employed
1755   to achieve those objectives. Assurance considerations are discussed in Appendix F.

                                              THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE SECURITY
            “Each of these [design] requirements [for mechanisms] is significant, for without them, the mechanism cannot
            be considered secure. The [need to be tamper-proof] is obvious, since if the reference validation mechanism
            can be tampered with, its validity is destroyed, as is any hope of achieving security through it. The [third]
            requirement of always invoking the reference validation mechanism simply states that if the reference
            validation is (or must be) suspended for some group of programs, then those programs must be considered
            part of the security apparatus and be [tamper-proof and evaluatable]. The [evaluatable] requirement is
            equally important. It states that because the reference validation mechanism is the security mechanism in the
            system, it must be possible to ascertain that it works correctly in all cases and is always invoked. If this cannot
            be achieved, then there is no way to know that the reference validation correctly takes place in all cases, and
            therefore there is no basis for certifying a system as secure.”

1757
1758
1759   D.4.4 Situational Awareness
1760   Situational awareness is a foundational security means objective. That is, to achieve other security
1761   objectives, situational awareness is necessary and must be accounted for in design. For example:
1762   •    Mediating access requires situational awareness, including when rules for granting access
1763        involve conditions about the system and other recent access
1764   •    Ensuring intended behaviors and outcomes and preventing or limiting unintended behaviors
1765        and outcomes requires situational awareness
1766   •    Preventing and limiting loss is informed by comprehensive information about system states
1767        and conditions (Anomaly Detection).

1768   Situational awareness requires the ability to accurately detect, capture, record, and analyze the
1769   needed characteristics and details of the system’s behaviors and actions at a frequency and with
1770   the granularity necessary to act and/or inform external entities for subsequent action to be


       APPENDIX D                                                                                                           PAGE 89

1771   taken. 72 False positives and false negatives (e.g., “blind spots” [Saleh14]) are to be avoided to the
1772   extent practicable.

1773   Given the potential consequences due to compromises of situational awareness capabilities and
1774   wrongful attribution, the mechanisms used must meet the essential design criteria (Section D.4.2)
1775   with the appropriate rigor. The system audit logs and other system records often need stringent
1776   protection, such as using Distributed Privilege for access and storing the logs and records in a
1777   separate subsystem (Domain Separation).

1778   D.4.5 Trade Space Considerations
1779   System design involves trade space decisions. These decisions may be informed by criticality or
1780   priority of an asset, costs, and benefits of an approach. Decision-making about protecting assets
1781   include determining the criticality (e.g., assessing the positive effect in achieving objectives and
1782   the negative effect for any loss associated with the asset) and priority (i.e., relative ranking of
1783   equally critical assets) of each asset. The criticality and priority based on valuation are used in
1784   investment decisions on the type, rigor, and expected effectiveness of protection.

1785   The costs associated with a trustworthy secure design approach include the cost to acquire,
1786   develop, integrate, operate, and sustain the security features; the cost of the security features
1787   and functions in terms of their system performance impact; the cost of security services used by
1788   the system; the cost of developing and managing life cycle documentation and training; and the
1789   cost of obtaining and maintaining the target level of assurance.

1790   The cost of analysis to substantiate the trustworthiness claims of certain design choices is also an
1791   important trade space factor. Given two equally effective design options, the more attractive of
1792   the two options may be the one that has a lower relative cost to obtain the assurance needed to
1793   demonstrate satisfaction of trustworthiness claims. In all cases, the cost of system security must
1794   be assessed at the system level and consider trustworthiness objectives and the cost that is driven
1795   by the assurance activities necessary to achieve the trustworthiness objectives. Trustworthiness
1796   design principles such as Commensurate Rigor and Commensurate Trustworthiness inform the
1797   trade space analysis.

1798   The benefits derived from a trustworthy secure design approach are determined by its
1799   effectiveness in providing the required protection capability, the trustworthiness that can be
1800   placed on it, and the loss potential associated with it, given the value, criticality, exposure, and
1801   importance of the assets protected. An optimal balance between cost and benefit may be realized
1802   through the use of a less costly combination of engineering activities and system features and
1803   functions rather than the use of a single cost-prohibitive activity or security feature or function.
1804   Moreover, an adverse performance impact may preclude some security options.
1805
1806
1807

       72 Common organizational actions include: (1) responses to security-relevant anomalies, such as remedial training for

       users or replacing the right system component responsible for undesired system behaviors; and (2) audits of system
       activities, including assessing for suspicious patterns of access that indicate insider threats and to satisfy accountability
       regulations such as those required of financial institutions.

                                                      CONSERVATION OF RISK
             “The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only
             change in form. This law has many important implications in engineering, including implying the
             impossibility of creating a perpetual motion machine … There is a parallel pseudo-principle that
             is often offered in a half-joking maxim – risk can neither be created nor destroyed, only moved
             around. It is not universally true [but] it is worthwhile considering the pseudo-principle because
             often, a change to a design often does end up ‘squeezing the risk balloon,’ only to discover that
             the risk appears elsewhere, perhaps in an unexpected place in the system, which could cause the
             defended system to be less secure than the engineering intended.”

1811   PRINCIPLES FOR TRUSTWORTHY SECURE DESIGN
1812   FOUNDATIONS FOR ENGINEERING TRUSTWORTHY SECURE SYSTEMS 73

1813   This section describes the foundational principles that serve as the foundation for engineering
1814   trustworthy secure systems. The principles for trustworthy secure design provide a basis for
1815   reasoning about a system. As reasoning tools, the inherent suitability of the principles in a
1816   particular situation will depend on the judgment of the practitioner. Engineering judgment must
1817   be exercised when applying the principles for trustworthy secure systems. 74 The principles should
1818   not be applied as “rules” to be complied with, nor should they be prioritized, sequenced, or
1819   ordered for prescriptive application, or used individually or in groups as a basis for making
1820   judgments of conformance. Principles are subject to various priorities and constraints that may
1821   restrict or preclude their application. These principles may conflict with other principles and that
1822   conflict must be understood. In practice, the principles can be satisfied or implemented in various
1823   and often equally effective ways. Throughout the system life cycle, the use of specific principles
1824   may change in response to changes and variances in requirements, architecture and design, and
1825   risk acceptability. Therefore, their application should be planned for, appropriately scoped, and
1826   revisited throughout the system life cycle and engineering effort.

1827

                                                      KEY SECURITY OBJECTIVE
             An important objective for security is the reduction in uncertainty regarding the occurrence and
             effects of adverse events. Reducing the uncertainty of adverse events is achieved by eliminating
             hazards, susceptibility, and vulnerability to the extent possible. Where elimination cannot occur,
             their effects are controlled to the extent possible. Applying the design principles for trustworthy
             secure systems is a means to achieve the elimination and control of the hazards, susceptibility,
             and vulnerability that lead to adverse events [MITRE21].

1828
1829
1830   The principles for trustworthy secure design are representative of the practices of the safety,
1831   security, reliability, survivability, and resilience communities as well as the specialty engineering
1832   disciplines associated with those communities. Collectively, the goals of these practices represent
1833   the “end objectives” that the system must satisfy for trustworthy control of adverse effects. The
1834   principles are grounded in research, development, and application experience starting with the
1835   early incorporation of mechanisms into trusted operating systems to today’s components,
1836   environments, and systems and are expected to remain universally applicable for new emerging
1837   and maturing approaches. The concepts and theorems from the disciplines of computer science,

1844   E.1 CLEAR ABSTRACTIONS
1845   PRINCIPLE: The abstractions used to characterize the system are simple, well-defined, accurate,
1846   precise, necessary, and sufficient.
1847   Note: Abstractions can help manage the complexity of the system [ISO 24765]. Clarity in the
1848   abstract representations of the system facilitates an accurate understanding of the system and
1849   how the system functions to deliver the required capability. Clear abstractions also reduce the
1850   potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of what is represented by the abstraction.
1851   Applying the principle of clear abstractions means that a system has simple, well-defined
1852   interfaces and functions that provide a consistent and intuitive view of the data and how it is
1853   managed. The elegance (e.g., accuracy, precision, simplicity, necessity, sufficiency) of the system
1854   interfaces – combined with a precise definition of the functional behavior of the interfaces –
1855   promotes ease of analysis, inspection, and testing, as well as the correct and secure use of the
1856   system. Examples that reflect the application of this principle include avoidance of redundant,
1857   unused interfaces; information hiding; 76 and avoidance of semantic overloading of interfaces or


       75 For example, trustworthiness requires mechanisms be evaluatable (Section D.4.2). Consequently, many principles

       deal with reducing and managing complexity and creating systems that can be more easily evaluated. See [Sheard18]
       for discussions on how systems may be too complex to be analyzed for adequate assurance.
       76 The term information hiding, also called representation-independent programming, is a design discipline to ensure

       that the internal representation of information in one system component is not visible to another system component
       invoking or calling the first component, such that the published abstraction is not influenced by how the data may be
       managed internally.

1858   their parameters (e.g., not using one function to provide different functionality, depending on
1859   how it is used).
1860   It is important to ensure that the proper rigor is applied in the development of system abstractions
1861   during design. Clarity in the abstract representation of the system requires the use of well-defined
1862   syntax and semantics with elaboration as needed to ensure the representations are well-defined,
1863   precise, necessary, and sufficient. Clear abstractions promote confidence in analysis, verification,
1864   and the correct use of the system. Abstractions can be achieved using models, including Systems
1865   Modeling Languages.

1867   E.2 COMMENSURATE RIGOR
1868   PRINCIPLE: The rigor associated with the conduct of an engineering activity provides the
1869   confidence required to address the most significant adverse effect that can occur.
1870   Note: Rigor determines the scope, depth, and detail of an engineering activity. Rigor is a means
1871   to provide confidence in the results of a completed engineering activity. Generally, an increase in
1872   rigor translates into an increase in confidence in the results of the activity. Further, increased
1873   confidence reduces the uncertainty that can also reduce risk or provide a better understanding of
1874   what to address to achieve risk reduction. The relationship between rigor and the criticality of
1875   data and information used to make decisions is recognized by systems analysis practice [ISO
1876   15288].
1877   The principle of commensurate rigor helps to ensure that the concept of rigor is included as an
1878   equal factor in the trade space of capability, adverse effect, cost, and schedule in the planning
1879   and conduct of engineering activities, method and tool selection, and personnel selection. An
1880   increase in rigor may translate into an increase in the cost of personnel, methods, and tools
1881   required to complete rigorous engineering activities or an increase in schedule to accomplish the
1882   activities with the expected rigor. Any increased cost that may occur can be justified by acquiring
1883   confidence about system performance to limit loss while also addressing the system's ability to
1884   deliver the capability. Therefore, the rigor associated with an engineering activity should be
1885   commensurate to the significance of the most adverse effect associated with the activity.

1887   E.3 COMMENSURATE TRUSTWORTHINESS
1888   PRINCIPLE: A system element is trustworthy to a level commensurate with the most significant
1889   adverse effect that results from a failure of that element.
1890   Note: A trusted element continuously exhibits properties of trust during the time that it is
1891   depended upon by other system elements. The degree of trustworthiness needed for a trusted
1892   element is determined by those entities that depend on the element. Some basis is required to
1893   support decisions about trust and trustworthiness. The basis includes expressing the trust that is
1894   to be placed in a system element, expressing the trustworthiness that is exhibited by the element,
1895   and comparing the trustworthiness of different system elements. This principle is particularly
1896   relevant when considering systems and elements with complex chains of trust dependencies.

1898   E.4 COMPOSITIONAL TRUSTWORTHINESS
1899   PRINCIPLE: The system design is trustworthy for each aggregate composition of interacting system
1900   elements.
1901   Note: The trustworthiness of an aggregate of composed system elements cannot be assumed
1902   based on the trustworthiness assertions of each individual element in the aggregate. Further, the
1903   trustworthiness of an aggregate of composed trustworthy system elements cannot be assumed
1904   to be equal to the trustworthiness of the least trustworthy element in the aggregate. By definition,
1905   a system is a combination of interacting system elements. Each system function results from the
1906   emergent behavior of a composed set of system elements. Similarly, the trustworthiness of a
1907   composed set of system elements is an emergent property of the composition. Therefore, the
1908   trustworthiness of the composed set of system elements (i.e., aggregate) for a given system
1909   function must be determined by treating the aggregate as a single discrete element. The
1910   compositional trustworthiness principle addresses how an argument can be made for system-
1911   level trustworthiness given how the constituent elements of the system compose to form the
1912   system and do so by adhering to the composition principles.
1913   REFERENCES: [ISO 15288]; [Neumann00]; [Neumann04]; [Leveson11].

1914   E.5 HIERARCHICAL PROTECTION
1915   PRINCIPLE: A system element need not be protected from more trustworthy elements.
1916   Note: Hierarchical protection is a simplifying assumption for trade decisions to help determine
1917   where emphasis is placed in providing protection and the extent of the protection effectiveness.
1918   The simplifying assumption introduces susceptibilities to system elements that are dependent on
1919   more trustworthy elements. The assumption relies on validated trust assertions about the more
1920   trustworthy element and acceptable uncertainty associated with behavior outside of the scope of
1921   the validated trust assertions. For example, systems may include a human element, which is often
1922   the more trustworthy element. The assertions of the trusted human are violated for the malicious
1923   insider threat. The extent to which any element is considered trustworthy has limits, and beyond
1924   those limits, the element should not be assumed to remain trustworthy. In the degenerate case
1925   of the most trustworthy system element, it must protect itself from all other elements. For
1926   example, if an operating system kernel is deemed the most trustworthy component in a system,
1927   then it must protect itself from the less trustworthy applications it supports. However, the
1928   applications do not need to protect themselves from the operating system kernel.
1929   REFERENCES: [Neumann04]; [Smith12]

1930   E.6 MINIMAL TRUSTED ELEMENTS
1931   PRINCIPLE: A system has as few trusted system elements as practicable.
1932   Note: Minimizing trusted system elements is a cost-benefit trade space consideration employed
1933   for the functional allocation of trust within the system. The need for trust is tied to the function
1934   provided by a system element, and that need is independent of any distribution of trust across
1935   multiple elements in the architecture. The trade decision is, therefore, how best to allocate trust
1936   to system elements given the functions they provide and how the elements are best distributed
1937   throughout the architecture where distribution is a justified need. Minimizing trusted system
1938   elements is one consideration in making that decision.


       APPENDIX E                                                                                     PAGE 95

1939   Trusted elements are generally costlier to construct due to increased rigor in engineering
1940   processes and activities. They also require more analysis to qualify their trustworthiness.
1941   Minimizing the number of trusted system elements reduces the cost of analysis (i.e., decreases
1942   the size, scope, and complexity of the analysis). When the minimization of trusted system
1943   elements considers the principle of Commensurate Protection, the cost-effectiveness of the
1944   analysis is also ensured (i.e., cost of the analysis is justified by the extent of trust required).
1945   Historically, the analysis of interactions between trusted system elements and untrusted system
1946   elements is one of the most important aspects of the trust-based verification of system security
1947   performance. If these interactions are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also
1948   be more difficult to ascertain than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly
1949   constructed. In general, fewer trusted components will result in fewer internal trust relationships
1950   and a simpler system.

1952   E.7 REDUCED COMPLEXITY
1953   PRINCIPLE: The system design is as simple as practicable.
1954   Note: Many engineered systems are complex. Complexity can be found in the system structure,
1955   interfaces, dependencies, data and control flows, and the system’s interaction with its external
1956   environment. Some degree of complexity in the system design is inherent, unavoidable, and must
1957   be accepted. The objective is to ensure that the design reflects the extent to which complexity
1958   can be reasonably minimized (i.e., avoid unnecessary complexity). Simplicity in the system design
1959   reduces complexity, allows for increased confidence in the ability to understand the design, and
1960   is less prone to error. A simpler design is less prone to erroneous interpretation during system
1961   analysis, system implementation, and system verification [Moller08]. Reduced complexity
1962   contributes to confidence in the technical understanding of the design, enabling more informed
1963   trade decisions. It also facilitates the identification of vulnerabilities and the verification of the
1964   correctness and completeness of system security functions.
1965   Complexity is impacted by how the system is decomposed into constituent elements, aggregates
1966   of elements (e.g., subsystems, assemblies), and the composition of those elements to comprise
1967   the system. Identifying and assessing loss scenarios, susceptibilities, and vulnerabilities is made
1968   more difficult by complexity. Thus, reducing complexity helps to facilitate the identification and
1969   assessment of loss scenarios, hazards, susceptibility, and vulnerability to all forms of adversity.
1970   Finally, any conclusion about the correctness, completeness, and existence of vulnerabilities in
1971   systems or system elements can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to
1972   conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex. The
1973   principle of reduced complexity may also be referred to as the principle of simplification or least
1974   common mechanism.

1976   E.8 SELF-RELIANT TRUSTWORTHINESS
1977   PRINCIPLE: The trustworthiness of a system element is achieved with minimal dependence on
1978   other elements.
1979   Note: In the ideal case, the trustworthiness of a system element occurs when the claim of
1980   trustworthiness is not dependent on protection from another system element. If an element is

       APPENDIX E                                                                                      PAGE 96

1981   dependent on other elements to satisfy its trustworthiness claims, then that element’s
1982   trustworthiness is susceptible to any loss or degradation of the protection capability provided by
1983   the other element. The considerations for the extent to which a system element exhibits self-
1984   reliant trustworthiness include:
1985   •    The trustworthiness objective for the capability
1986   •    The trustworthiness of the system element in providing the capability
1987   •    The extent to which the capability provided by a system element is dependent on another
1988        element
1989   •    The extent to which the trustworthiness associated with a capability is dependent on another
1990        system element
1991   An argument for self-reliant trustworthiness can be applied at the discrete system element level,
1992   at the level of an aggregate of elements, at the system level, or at the system of systems level. In
1993   all cases, the distinction between the capability provided and the trustworthiness responsibility
1994   for that capability must be preserved (e.g., self-reliant trustworthiness cannot be claimed if the
1995   protection assertions for trust are allocated to and therefore dependent on some other entity).
1996   Similarly, when a system capability is distributed across multiple system elements, self-reliant
1997   trustworthiness requires that the trust expectations for the capability are properly allocated
1998   across the elements that comprise the distributed capability.
1999   The judgment that a system element is self-reliantly trustworthy is based on the element’s ability
2000   to satisfy a specific set of requirements and associated assumptions. An element that is self-
2001   reliantly trustworthy for one set of requirements and assumptions is not necessarily self-reliantly
2002   trustworthy for other sets of requirements and assumptions. Any change in the requirement, the
2003   satisfaction of the requirement, or in the assumptions associated with the requirement requires
2004   reassessment to determine that the element remains self-reliantly trustworthy.

2009   E.9 STRUCTURED DECOMPOSITION AND COMPOSITION
2010   PRINCIPLE: System complexity is managed through the structured decomposition of the system
2011   and the structured composition of the constituent elements to deliver the required capability.
2012   Note: The structured decomposition of the system and the subsequent composition of the system
2013   elements are guided and informed by the concepts of modularity, layering, and partially ordered
2014   dependencies. Modularity is the system design technique to “divide and conquer” – that is, sub-
2015   divide the system into smaller, well-defined cohesive components and assemblies that are
2016   referred to as modules. Modularity serves to isolate functions and data structures into well-
2017   defined logical units. Modular decomposition can include the allocation of policies to systems in

2018   a network, the allocation of system policies to layers, the separation of system applications into
2019   processes with distinct address spaces, and the separation of processes into subjects with distinct
2020   privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains. Modular design may also extend to
2021   consider trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and policy.
2022   Layering is the grouping of modules into a relational structure with well-defined interfaces,
2023   function, data, and control flow so that the dependencies graph among layers is linearly or
2024   partially ordered such that higher layers are dependent only on lower layers [Neumann04].
2025   Partially ordered dependencies among modules (e.g., if module A depends on module B, then
2026   module B cannot depend on module A) and system layering contribute significantly to system
2027   design simplicity and coherence. While a partial ordering of all functions and processes may not
2028   be possible, the inherent problems of circularity can be more easily managed if the circular
2029   dependencies are constrained to occur within layers and minimized within each layer. Partially
2030   ordered dependencies also facilitate system testing and analysis and enable a strong form of loose
2031   coupling (i.e., minimizing interdependencies among modules).
2032   Modularity and layering are effective in managing the complexity of the composed system. They
2033   provide the means to decompose the system into discrete and aggregate elements to better
2034   comprehend the system in terms of its structure, flows, relationships, and how the system
2035   delivers the required capability. The structured composition of the constituent elements must
2036   also adhere to the principle of Compositional Trustworthiness to provide a basis to support claims
2037   about how the system is composed based on the application of modularity, layering, and partially
2038   ordered dependencies to achieve authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes.

2040   E.10 SUBSTANTIATED TRUSTWORTHINESS
2041   PRINCIPLE: System trustworthiness judgments are based on evidence that demonstrates the
2042   criteria for trustworthiness have been satisfied.
2043   Note: Trustworthiness should not be assumed but substantiated through evidence that clearly
2044   enables determination of the extent to which an entity is worth being trusted. This helps to ensure
2045   that an entity is never trusted beyond the extent to which it is worthy of trust. The approach to
2046   substantiated trustworthiness requires commensurate rigor with cautious mistrust (i.e., system
                                                                      77
2047   elements are assumed to be guilty until proven innocent). Substantiated trustworthiness is
2048   characterized by a design mentality in which all components involved in the design context (i.e.,
2049   a system element and the elements with which it interacts) are treated with a mutually suspicious
2050   mindset [Schroeder77][Neumann04]. Such mutual suspicion reflects cautious distrust – the
2051   feeling or thought that something undesired, unwanted, or unexpected is possible or can happen.
2052   The design for every system element should reflect a lack of trust in interacting elements or itself.
2053   This suspicion assumes element non-performance and addresses the following two cases:
2054   •    Interacting element suspicion (mutual suspicion): The system element-of-interest design is
2055        based on the non-performance of the elements it interacts with and how their non-
2056        performance can influence the element-of-interest’s behavior and outcomes. Designing to
2057        mutual suspicion is reinforced by applying the principle of Least Privilege to all entities (so an

2058        element executes with only the privileges needed, mitigating harm that may be created) while
2059        applying the principle of Least Persistence so that each element is minimally exposed.
2060   •    Self-suspicion: The design for the system element-of-interest must consider its own non-
2061        performance independent of any external influence. Designing to self-suspicion may involve
2062        self-monitoring and built-in actions, including built-in testing at the initiation of the element.
2063   This approach forces the system designer to assume things will not go right and to rigorously seek
2064   evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design when things go wrong. Considerations
2065   for system element non-performance include:
2066   •    An expectation that design elements will behave and produce outcomes that are inconsistent
2067        with their design intent
2068   •    The constraints, assumptions, and preconditions that are associated with achieving threshold
2069        performance
2070   •    Intentional and unintentional events and conditions, typically referred to by terms like fault,

2073   E.11 TRUSTWORTHY SYSTEM CONTROL
2074   PRINCIPLE: The design for system control functions conforms to the properties of the generalized
2075   reference monitor.
2076   Note: The trustworthy system control principle reflects the generalization of the reference
2077   monitor concept to provide a uniform design assurance basis for trustworthy system control
2078   mechanisms or constraint-enforcing mechanisms that compose to provide system control
2079   functions. The reference monitor concept (Section D.4.2) is a foundational access control concept
2080   for secure system design. It is defined as a trustworthy abstract machine that mediates all
2081   accesses to objects by subjects [TCSEC85]. As a concept for an abstract machine, the reference
2082   monitor does not address any specific implementation. A reference validation mechanism, a
2083   combination of hardware and software, realizes the reference monitor concept to provide the
2084   access mediation foundation for a secure system [Anderson72].
2085   The reference monitor concept has three criterion that provide design assurance of its realization
2086   as a reference validation mechanism:
2087   •    The reference validation mechanism must be tamper-proof, ensuring that its integrity and
2088        validity is not destroyed.
2089   •    The reference validation mechanism must always be invoked, and if it cannot be, then the
2090        group of programs for which it provides validation services must be considered part of the
2091        reference validation mechanism and be subject to the first and third requirements.
2092   •    The reference validation mechanism must be subject to rigorous analysis and tests, the
2093        completeness of which can be assured (with the purpose of ascertaining that the reference
2094        validation mechanism works correctly in all cases).
2095   For trustworthy system control, a fourth criterion of non-bypassability is added (Section D.4.2).
2096   Successful achievement of these criteria will prevent the interference of outside entities on a
2097   protection mechanism or controller. More specifically:

       APPENDIX E                                                                                       PAGE 99

2098   •    A protection mechanism or feature should not be circumventable (i.e., the mechanism should
2099        be non-bypassable).
2100   •    A protection mechanism or feature should be evaluatable (i.e., sufficiently small and simple
2101        enough to be assessed to produce adequate confidence in the protection provided, the
2102        constraint or control objective enforced, and the correct implementation of the mechanism
2103        [see Reduced Complexity]).
2104   •    A protection mechanism or feature is always invoked, providing continuous protection.
2105   •    A protection mechanism or feature must be tamper-proof (i.e., neither the protection
2106        functions nor the data that the functions depend on can be modified without authorization).
2107   Trustworthy system control also uses protective control. Protective control encompasses control,
2108   safety, and security concepts to establish a system capability that sufficiently:
2109   •    Enforces constraints to achieve only the authorized and intended system behaviors and
2110        outcomes
2111   •    Provides self-protection against targeted attack on the system
2112   •    Is absent of self-induced emergent, erroneous, unsafe, and non-secure control actions
2113   The notion of protective control underlies the loss control objectives and transforms the approach
2114   for design to not be dependent on having detailed knowledge of the capability, means, and
2115   methods of an adversary. This design approach can be employed in attack-dependent or attack-
2116   independent manners based on the limits of certainty for what is known with confidence about
2117   the adversary.
2118   Trustworthy system control serves well as the design basis for individual system elements,
2119   collections of elements, networks, and systems where intentional and unintentional adversity can
2120   prevent the achievement of the loss control objectives. The principle also drives the need for rigor
2121   in engineering activities commensurate to the trust placed in the system elements.

2123   E.12 ANOMALY DETECTION
2124   PRINCIPLE: Any salient anomaly in the system or in its environment is detected in a timely manner
2125   that enables effective response action.
2126   Note: The purpose of anomaly detection is to identify the need to take corrective action to address
2127   a loss condition that has occurred or that will occur if conditions that affect the system behavior
2128   are allowed to persist. Anomaly detection is critical to achieving the loss control objectives to
2129   prevent and limit loss and its adverse effects. The detection of such anomalies requires monitoring
2130   system behaviors and outcomes to confirm that they have not deviated from the design intent. It
2131   also requires monitoring conditions in the environment to identify or forecast those conditions
2132   that can cause an anomaly in the system if corrective action is not taken. The “timely manner”
2133   aspect of anomaly detection reflects the urgency to detect emerging loss conditions as early as
2134   possible. Early detection increases response action options, such as graduated response options,
2135   and ensures that response actions have sufficient time to have an effect. When the determination
2136   of response involves humans in the loop, early detection enables a more reasoned judgment of
2137   proper response.

2138   Anomaly detection can be implemented at varying levels of abstraction (e.g., system, sub-system,
2139   assembly, function, mechanism) and may occur in periodic, aperiodic, or event-driven manners.
2140   The basis for anomaly detection within the system is the expectation that the system behaviors,
2141   outcomes, and interactions produced are expected to remain consistent, adhere to some norm,
2142   or are deterministic across all system states and modes. The types of anomalies include those
2143   associated with the results of system behavior; state consistency; continuity of function; integrity,
2144   correctness, and trustworthiness of system elements; system configuration; and the abuse or
2145   misuse of the system.
2146   The basis for anomaly detection in the environment differs from that in the system because the
2147   environment is not within the control of the system. The environment presents a wide range of
2148   adversity to the system, and the system is designed to achieve its design intent within defined
2149   bounds of environmental conditions. Those bounds can be treated as the “norm” for anomaly
2150   detection, whereby environmental conditions that are trending beyond the norm or that reflect
2151   conditions outside of the norm may result in an adverse effect on the system, thus requiring a
2152   planned response to prepare for an impending difficulty or crisis.
2153   Anomaly detection requires capturing data to support all intended response actions for a
2154   detected anomaly, including attribution-related data. Consequently, the rigor in data describing
2155   the anomaly must be commensurate with the consequences of the loss scenarios associated with
2156   the anomaly and of wrong responses in addressing the detected anomaly. The responses taken
2157   will often rely on attribution to uniquely identifiable entities that may be responsible for
2158   undesired actions, behaviors, or outcomes. For non-human entities, corrective actions may
2159   include component replacements, repairs, or other corrections. For human entities, these may
2160   include training, remediation, or disciplinary actions. Wrongful attribution may have undesired
2161   consequences, such as the cost of unnecessarily repairing the wrong system element while an
2162   undesired condition persists or the wrongful termination of an individual. Attribution rigor is
2163   driven by the needed proof that an entity is responsible for an anomaly. Three aspects of anomaly
2164   detection are necessary to provide criteria for an appropriate response action or set of actions:
2165   •    Basis for Correctness: A system model provides a basis against which actual behavior and
2166        outcomes can be compared to confidently enable conclusions that an anomaly exists or to
2167        determine or forecast that an anomaly is about to occur. System models includes normal,
2168        contingency, degraded, and other system states/modes of operation and account for the
2169        adversity to which the system is subjected.
2170   •    Data Collection: Systems capture self-awareness data in the form of health, status, test, and
2171        other data indicative of actual behavior and outcomes, including traceability to support
2172        attribution. Terms for data collection include instrumentation, monitoring, logging, auditing,
2173        self-tests, and built-in tests.
2174   •    Data Interpretation: The interpretation of data allows for conclusions of unacceptable or
2175        suspicious events that have happened (e.g., halt or failure condition), that are progressing
2176        (e.g., approaching a threshold of failure condition), or that can be expected to happen (i.e., in
2177        the absence of change, the failure condition will occur), including tracing to responsible
2178        entities to inform appropriate responses to events.
2179   Caution must be taken with the use of design features that may hinder anomaly detection. Poorly
2180   designed lines of defense for defense in depth have been found to conceal emerging dangerous
2181   system states and conditions, especially from human observers [Saleh14]. The system design must


       APPENDIX E                                                                                     PAGE 101

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2182   minimize the difference between estimated system states and conditions and actual system
2183   states and conditions.
2184   Two approaches to anomaly detection are:
2185   •    Self-Anomaly Detection: An entity has no dependency on another entity to detect an
2186        anomaly within the scope of its intended design. Self-anomaly detection usually involves an
2187        axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity. Typically, trusted
2188        elements have the capability for self-anomaly detection. This means that at the highest level
2189        of trustworthiness, an entity must be able to assess its internal state and functionality to a
2190        meaningful extent at various stages of execution. The detected anomalies must correlate to
2191        the trustworthiness assumptions placed on the entity.
2192   •    Dependent Anomaly Detection: An entity-of-interest is dependent on another entity for
2193        some or all anomalies that are detected. When an entity-of-interest relies on another entity
2194        for any portion of the assessment, that entity must be at least as trustworthy as the entity-
2195        of-interest.

2200   E.13 COMMENSURATE PROTECTION
2201   PRINCIPLE: The strength and type of protection provided to a system element is commensurate
2202   with the most significant adverse effect that results from a failure of that element.
2203   Note: The strength and effectiveness of the protection for a system element must be proportional
2204   to the need. As the need increases, the protection of that element should also increase to the
2205   same degree. Need is derived from the most significant adverse effect associated with the system
2206   element or the trust that is placed in the element. The protection can come in the form of the
2207   system element’s own self-protection, from protections provided by the system architecture, or
2208   from protection provided by other elements. The needed strength of protection is independent
2209   of these design choices (or others, such as distributed versus centralized design), a concept
2210   sometimes referred to as secure distributed composition [Neumann04]. Furthermore, confidence
2211   in the effectiveness of the protections provided to a system element should also increase
2212   commensurate to the need. This is addressed by the principle of Commensurate Rigor.
2213   REFERENCES: [Neumann04]; [Levin07].

2214   E.14 COMMENSURATE RESPONSE
2215   PRINCIPLE: The system design matches the aggressiveness of an engineered response action’s
2216   effect to the needed immediacy to control the effects of each loss scenario.


       APPENDIX E                                                                                              PAGE 102

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2217   Note: The selected response to a detected anomaly should consider three factors to determine
2218   the effect that the response has on the loss and the system:
2219   •    The expected effectiveness and aggressiveness of the engineered response to directly address
2220        the anomaly and to prevent or limit the loss
2221   •    The direct-, residual-, or side effect of the response on the system
2222   •    The opportunities that remain to take other response action should the selected response fail
2223        to achieve the intended result
2224   Responses can be achieved by a combination of fully manual, semi-automated, fully automated,
2225   or autonomous means. However, the response action is distinct from the determination that a
2226   response is necessary and from the notification or signaling that invokes the response action.
2227   Commensurate responses require consideration of the response-effect-consequence relationship
2228   associated with a specific loss. Ideally, for any given need for a response, a single action taken will
2229   be effective to resolve the loss concern and will have no associated adverse effect. Practically,
2230   due to complexity and the limits of certainty, the response action may not have the desired effect,
2231   may compound the problem, or may cause another problem. The balance required is one that
2232   determines if, when, and how a response action should be taken to be initially more aggressive
2233   or initially less aggressive. The severity of the problem and the time available for an effective
2234   response dictates a strategy for a continuum of responses, characterized by two extremes:
2235   •    Graduated Response: A graduated response is initially the least aggressive or impactful action
2236        possible to prevent the loss from continuing or escalating and does so with consideration of
2237        the possible side effects associated with the response action. The graduated response allows
2238        for taking increasingly more aggressive action should the loss situation persist or escalate.
2239   •    Ungraduated Response: An ungraduated response is the most aggressive and most impactful
2240        action to prevent the loss from continuing or escalating and does so without consideration of
2241        the potential side effects associated with the response action. The ungraduated response
2242        recognizes the severity of the loss as justifying the most aggressive action, even if that option
2243        provides no alternatives should it fail to have the intended or desired effect or if it causes
2244        other losses to occur.
2245   Without early observability of potential loss, the option for a graduated response may not exist.
2246   Commensurate response is aided by early detection, which in turn increases the options for a
2247   graduated response.

2249   E.15 CONTINUOUS PROTECTION
2250   PRINCIPLE: The protection provided for a system element must be effective and uninterrupted
2251   during the time that the protection is required.
2252   Note: The protection capability must be uninterrupted across all relevant system states, modes,
2253   and transitions for there to be assurance that the system can be effective in delivering the
2254   required capability while controlling loss. Continuous protection requires adherence to the
2255   following principles:




       APPENDIX E                                                                                     PAGE 103

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2256   •    Trustworthy System Control: Every controlled action is constrained by the mechanism, and
2257        the mechanism can protect itself from tampering. Sufficient assurance of the correctness and
2258        completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing.
2259   •    Protective Failure and Protective Recovery: A protective state is preserved during error, fault,
2260        failure, and successful attack, as well as during the recovery of assets or of recovery to normal,
2261        degraded, or alternative operational modes.
2262   Continuous protection applies to all configurations, states, and modes of the system, as well as
2263   the transitions between those configurations, states, and modes. The system design must ensure
2264   that protections are coordinated and composed in a non-conflicting and mutually supportive
2265   manner across the non-behavioral aspects of the system structure and the behavioral aspects of
2266   system function and data flow.
2267   While the design for continuous protection applies for the entire time that the protection is
2268   required, sometimes, by design, protection capability is intentionally disabled (e.g., Battleshort 78
2269   intentional override). The intentional disabling/override of protection is an exception case and,
2270   therefore, does not violate this principle. That is, the principle of Continuous Protection applies
2271   only for the entirety of time that the protection is required and not knowingly and intentionally
2272   disabled. 79
2273   REFERENCES: [Levin07].

2274   E.16 DEFENSE IN DEPTH
2275   PRINCIPLE: Loss is prevented or minimized by employing multiple coordinated mechanisms.
2276   Note: The coordinated deployment of multiple protective mechanisms for a system helps to avoid
2277   single points of failure. The principle of defense in depth has three pillars:
2278   •    Multiple lines of defenses or barriers should be placed along loss scenario sequences.
2279   •    Loss control should not rely on a single defensive element.
2280   •    The successive barriers should be diverse in nature and include technical, operational, and
2281        organizational barriers.
2282   Defense in depth requires the use of coordinated mechanisms (active) within an architectural
                                                                   80
2283   structure (passive) that achieves the depth characteristic. Ideally, the initial lines of defense
2284   prevent loss, while subsequent lines of defense block loss scenario escalation and/or contain loss
2285   and potential consequences when needed. A defense-in-depth strategy examines loss scenarios
2286   for those points of opportunity to prevent or contain loss. It also leverages the opportunities to
2287   use active or passive mechanisms or constraints to meet loss control objectives.




       78 Battleshort is a switch used to bypass normal interlocks in mission-critical equipment (e.g., equipment that must not

       be shut down or the mission function will fail) during battle conditions [DOD 2007].
       79 However, the inclusion of a capability for intentionally disabling/overriding protection requires additional control

       features and devices and associated analysis for the enforcement of constraints to prevent the inadvertent actuation
       of the override capability.
       80 While the discussion in this section is limited to the machine, defense in depth may involve the combination of

       technical, operational, and organizational elements. See [IATF02] for additional discussion on defense in depth.

       APPENDIX E                                                                                                     PAGE 104

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2288   The coordination of defense-in-depth mechanisms (i.e., combinations of structural, data, and
2289   control flow coordination) in conjunction with other design principles (e.g., Anomaly Detection,
2290   Commensurate Response) reflects a design strategy to satisfy the specified loss control objectives.
2291   While defense in depth distributes the protection capability to many components, a defense-in-
2292   depth strategy may also consider a distributed composition to a line of defense. A protection
2293   capability provided by a single system component is a potential single point of failure or
2294   bottleneck to system performance. It may also raise other concerns. A distributed composition of
2295   a defense layer may provide additional options within the coordination of layers.
2296   Defense in depth is, in part, a form of the principle of Protective Failure. It helps satisfy the
2297   objective that a failure of a system element should not result in an unacceptable loss. However,
2298   it does not satisfy the objective that a failure of a system element should not invoke another loss
2299   scenario.

2301   E.17 DISTRIBUTED PRIVILEGE
2302   PRINCIPLE: Multiple authorized entities act in a coordinated manner before an operation on the
2303   system is allowed to occur.
2304   Note: Distributed privilege 81 is a means to prevent a single authorized entity from performing an
2305   erroneous action, whether or not that action is performed with intent. Distributed privilege
2306   requires that an erroneous action can only be performed if multiple entities agree to do so, for
2307   either legitimate (e.g., override of the protection in extreme cases) or illegitimate purposes (e.g.,
2308   collusion to intentionally take improper action). In the case of an attack on an operation,
2309   distributed privilege forces the adversary to target all the entities to whom privilege is distributed.
2310   Distributed privilege separates, divides, or in some other manner distributes the privileges
2311   required to perform an operation among multiple entities. The distribution of privilege includes a
2312   set of rules, conditions, and constraints that describe how multiple entities must interact through
2313   positive actions before a requested operation can proceed and be completed. The rules,
2314   conditions, and constraints may reflect combinations of the following, all of which require that
2315   multiple conditions be met for the operation to proceed:
2316   •    Simultaneous Actions: Multiple different authorized entities execute a command within a
2317        specified time window.
2318   •    Sequenced Actions: Multiple different entities interact within a linear sequence of actions
2319        where each successive action is enabled only by the successful completion of a prior action.
2320   •    Parallel Actions: Multiple entities execute sequences concurrently, and success is achieved
2321        either by a consensus of the results of each concurrent action or by voting among the
2322        participants.

2324   E.18 DIVERSITY (DYNAMICITY)
2325   PRINCIPLE: The system design delivers the required capability through structural, behavioral, or
2326   data or control flow variation.
2327   Note: A system design that incorporates diversity helps to avoid common mode failures and
2328   introduces unpredictability to adversaries, thus complicating the planning and execution of
2329   where, when, and how to target their attacks. While the system behaviors that result from a
2330   design may be unpredictable from the viewpoint of the adversary, the design itself must be
2331   predictable and verifiable in achieving only the intended outcomes. The options for diversity
2332   include variety in the system structural and architectural design elements, the system functional
2333   and behavioral elements, the interfaces and interconnections between interfaces, the data and
2334   control flow, and the technology and component selection. Diversity can reside in:
2335   •    Fixed or static characteristics of the system (e.g., multiple instances of a system element,
2336        multiple communication channels)
2337   •    Variable or dynamic characteristics of the system (e.g., reconfiguration, relocation, refresh of
2338        system elements; random routing of data over different communication channels from source
2339        to destination; the ability to change aspects of the system behavior, structure, data, or
2340        configuration in a random but nonetheless verifiable manner)
2341   A design approach that includes diversity in structure, configuration, communications, protocols,
2342   and similar or dissimilar system elements (e.g., N-version, heterogeneity) increases uncertainty
2343   due to the increased complexity of the design and the behaviors and outcomes that stem from
2344   emergent effects, side effects, and feature interaction. This drives the need for confidence that
2345   the design approach will deliver only the authorized and intended functional behavior, produce
2346   only the authorized and intended outcomes, and do so in a manner that allows for control over
2347   side effects, emergence, and feature interaction.
2348   Diversity options include intentionally designed regular or irregular changes in the system (e.g.,
2349   implementing the concept of dynamicity). A design incorporating dynamicity can: (1) complicate
2350   the attack planning of an adversary, (2) reduce the potential for non-adversarial adversity to have
2351   an effect on the system, (3) provide the margin to deliver a required capability while reducing
2352   actual losses, and (4) protect against the effects of an attack. Dynamic change may refer to either
2353   shifting the target or shifting the behaviors of a target in performing its activities (e.g., frequency
2354   hopping complicates attempts to intercept or jam signals within wireless communications).
2355   The uncertainty and diminished predictability associated with the employment of diversity and
2356   dynamicity in design can be problematic where it impedes or prevents having confidence that the
2357   system will function and produce outcomes only as authorized and intended. It is important to
2358   differentiate where the uncertainty lies: (1) uncertainty in how the system achieves an end
2359   objective (i.e., the means to an end) or (2) uncertainty that an objective will be achieved (i.e.,
2360   achieving the end). A design that employs diversity and dynamicity must be based on acquiring
2361   confidence that the system will produce only the desired results despite uncertainty in knowing
2362   exactly how the desired results are achieved. This constitutes a design trade that is specific to
2363   diversity- and dynamicity-based designs. Diversity may have a cost (e.g., hardware, software,
2364   maintenance, training, assurance) greater than the value or effectiveness that it provides.

2366   E.19 DOMAIN SEPARATION
2367   PRINCIPLE: Domains with distinctly different protection needs are physically or logically separated.
2368   Note: The separation of domains enables enhanced control and, therefore, protection of system
2369   function and the flow of data. Control relative to separated domains limits the extent to which an
2370   entity or domain is influenced by or is able to influence some other entity or domain, thereby
2371   enhancing the protection of a domain. This is achieved through the control of information flow
2372   and data between domains as well as control over the use of a system capability between
2373   domains.
2374   The differing protection needs that are used to define domains may be thought of in terms of
2375   protecting the domain from influence by external entities (i.e., susceptibility) and protecting
2376   external entities from erroneous behavior that occurs within the domain (i.e., containment). This
2377   distinction may include separating critical functions from less critical functions, such as separating
2378   the flight control functions of a transport aircraft from the environmental control functions that
2379   maintain a safe environment for the cargo and passengers being transported.
2380   Historically, domain separation has been used to enforce the separation of roles or privileges (i.e.,
2381   least privilege). For example, a system may separate an “administrative” or “supervisor” domain
2382   from “user” domains. The administrative domain is accessible only by system administrators with
2383   proper privileges, and distinctly administrative functions may only be executed by administrators
2384   from the administrative domain. Similarly, data intended to only be accessed by administrators
2385   and administrative functions (e.g., system configurations) is stored and accessed only within that
2386   domain, ensuring needed protection of the data.
2387   Domain separation requires a domain to be contained within its own protected subsystem so that
2388   elements of the domain are only directly accessible by procedures or functions of the protected
2389   subsystem. The concept of isolation enables the implementation of domain separation. Isolation
2390   limits the extent to which one domain can influence or can be influenced by other entities. The
2391   challenge is that the system elements within domains must at times interact with other elements
2392   and the environment to deliver a capability. Every interface that results from design decisions can
2393   diminish domain separation while achieving requirements for a system capability. External
2394   requests for resources or functions within protected subsystems are arbitrated at these
2395   interfaces. Firewall, data diodes, and cross-domain solutions (CDS) are examples of mechanisms
2396   that enable varying degrees of control over the interactions between separated domains.
2397   Encryption is another mechanism often used to provide domain separation. For example,
2398   communication between distinct subsystems within a domain may be encrypted with a key that
2399   is known only to the subsystems within the domain. Where a common storage module or
2400   subsystem is used for multiple domains, encryption may be used to limit information access to
2401   the domain that owns the key to decrypt.

2403   E.20 LEAST FUNCTIONALITY
2404   PRINCIPLE: Each system element has the capability to accomplish its required functions but no
2405   more.
2406   Note: Susceptibility and vulnerability increase unnecessarily when a system element provides
2407   more functionality than is needed to achieve its intended purpose. Least functionality reduces the


       APPENDIX E                                                                                     PAGE 107

2408   potential for susceptibility and vulnerability and reduces the scope of analysis of the system
2409   element’s trustworthiness and loss potential. The strictest interpretation of least functionality is
2410   to prohibit any system element functions that are not required. Where that is not possible or
2411   practical, the unnecessary functions of the system element should be disabled, disarmed, or put
2412   into a “safe” mode that prevents the functions from being used. In all other cases, mediated
2413   access can be used to prevent access to and use of the unneeded functions. An example of when
2414   it may not be possible or practical to avoid unnecessary functions is the use of commercial off-
2415   the-shelf (COTS) components. COTS components typically contain functions beyond those
2416   required to fulfill its intended purpose. In such cases, the components should be configured to
2417   enable only the functions that are required to fulfill its purpose and prohibit or restrict functions
2418   that are not required to fulfill its purpose.
2419   REFERENCES: [Neumann04]; [Levin07].

2420   E.21 LEAST PERSISTENCE
2421   PRINCIPLE: System elements and other resources are available, accessible, and able to fulfill their
2422   design intent only for the time for which they are needed.
2423   Note: Least persistence reduces susceptibility. It limits the extent to which functions, resources,
2424   data, and information remain present, accessible, and usable when not required, thereby
2425   reducing the opportunity for their inadvertent or unauthorized use, modification, or activation.
2426   The broadest interpretation of least persistence is to not install, instantiate, or apply power to
2427   system elements and resources until needed and to completely remove system elements or
2428   power from elements and resources when they are no longer required. Where that condition is
2429   not possible or practical, those system elements and resources should be fully disabled, disarmed,
2430   or put into safe mode to prevent their ability to function or to be used. At a minimum, Mediated
2431   Access should include constraints on the time and duration of their use.
2432   Three conditions must be satisfied for an active system element or resource to be usable, with
2433   two of these conditions applying to non-active elements or resources:
2434   •    Presence (active and non-active): The system element or resource must be installed, loaded,
2435        residing in memory (software), and configured.
2436   •    Accessible (active and non-active): The system element or resource must be invoked,
2437        interacted with, or operated on.
2438   •    Able to Function (active): The system element or resource must be able to execute (i.e.,
2439        powered on, enabled, or armed) to deliver a service or perform a function.
2440   Least persistence is reflected in concepts such as sanitizing, erasing, and clearing memory and/or
2441   storage locations; disabling, removing, and disconnecting network ports, system interfaces, and
2442   the services provided by system interfaces; powering off and unplugging hardware when not
2443   needed; and instantiating software just before needed and de-instantiating after it is no longer
2444   needed. Least persistence has added benefits that include simplifying the processes of:
2445   •    Cleansing the system element to remove corrupted aspects or side effects
2446   •    Re-establishing the system element to a known state (i.e., a refresh)
2447   •    Minimizing the time in which system elements are exposed to the environment, to attack,
2448        and to erroneous behavior


       APPENDIX E                                                                                    PAGE 108

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2449   Where system elements or resources are removed and then restored as needed, there must be a
2450   trusted representation of the system element and a trusted ability to instantiate that system
2451   element within the time constraints for its use.
2452   REFERENCES: [SP 800-160v2].

2453   E.22 LEAST PRIVILEGE
2454   PRINCIPLE: Each system element is allocated privileges that are necessary to accomplish its
2455   specified functions but no more.
2456   Note: System elements can be implemented by entities such as hardware, firmware, software,
2457   and personnel. By design, the system must be able to limit the scope of a system element’s
2458   actions. This has two desirable effects: (1) the impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the
2459   element is minimized, and (2) the analysis of the system element is simplified. A design driven by
2460   least privilege considerations results in a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition
2461   and the ability for the fine-grained allocation of privileges to human and machine elements. The
2462   application of the principle of least privilege means allocating the minimum (separate) privileges
2463   necessary to a system element according to the extent to which that element has a need to
2464   perform some function. This could include a need know, modify, delete, use, configure, authorize,
2465   start/enable, or stop/disable [Schroeder77]. In addition to its manifestations at the system
2466   interface, least privilege can also be used as a guide for the internal structure of the system itself,
2467   such as how to employ Domain Separation. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct
2468   modules so that only the system elements encapsulated by the module are directly accessed or
2469   operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be
2470   affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction with the module
2471   that contains those elements.
2472   REFERENCES: [Neumann04]; [Levin07]; [Saltzer75]; [Scroeder77].

2473   E.23 LEAST SHARING 82
2474   PRINCIPLE: System resources are shared among system elements only when necessary and among
2475   as few elements as possible.
2476   Note: Sharing via common mechanism and other means can increase the susceptibility of system
2477   resources (e.g., data, information, system variables, interfaces, functions, services) to
2478   unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification and can adversely affect the capabilities
2479   provided by the system. According to [Saltzer75], “Every shared mechanism (especially one
2480   involving shared variables) represents a potential information path between users and must be
2481   designed with great care to be sure it does not unintentionally compromise security.” A design
2482   that employs least sharing helps to reduce the adverse consequences that can result from sharing
2483   system functions, state, resources, and variables among different system elements. A system
2484   element that corrupts a shared state or shared variables has the potential to corrupt other
2485   elements whose behavior is dependent on the state. Minimized sharing also helps to simplify the
2486   design and implementation [Lampson73].



       82 The historically well-known security design principle, least common mechanism, is an instance of least sharing. The

       principle of least common mechanism is described in [Popek74].


       APPENDIX E                                                                                                   PAGE 109

2487   Two criteria provide the basis for applying the principle of least sharing: (1) share only if absolutely
2488   necessary, and (2) minimize sharing if allowed. The first criterion is a trade decision that factors
2489   in the cost and benefit of sharing resources against the increased exposure that results from the
2490   sharing. The second criterion is a constraint on the extent of sharing.

2492   E.24 LOSS MARGINS
2493   PRINCIPLE: The system is designed to operate in a state space sufficiently distanced below the
2494   threshold at which loss occurs.
2495   Note: Margins refer to the difference between a conservative threshold at which the system is
2496   expected to operate while subjected to adversity and the point at which the adversity results in
2497   failure. Loss margins are created by engineered features put in place to maintain operational
2498   conditions and the associated adversity level at some distance (i.e., conservative threshold) from
2499   the estimated critical adversity threshold or loss-triggering threshold. Loss margins also allow for
2500   increased time to detect the need for a response action (see Anomaly Detection), to determine
2501   what the response action should be (see Commensurate Response), and to complete the selected
2502   response action. When there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the response action, loss
2503   margins need to allow time to evaluate response effectiveness, determine any additional actions
2504   needed, and complete any selected actions.
2505   Uncertainty may derive from the environment of operation, the design and realization of the
2506   system, the utilization and sustainment of the system, and the adversity presenting itself to the
2507   system. Loss margins are effective in addressing uncertainty about how and when a loss-triggering
2508   event occurs. Specifically, loss margins are effective in addressing uncertainty associated with:
2509   •    Intelligently designed and executed attacks, including attacks that persist and evolve over
2510        time
2511   •    Unknown, unquantified, and underappreciated susceptibilities, threats, vulnerabilities,
2512        hazards, and associated risks
2513   For designs that incorporate loss margins, uncertainty about adversity makes determining the
2514   loss-triggering thresholds difficult. Loss margins for design should be determined with a balance
2515   between certainty (i.e., what has happened and can happen again) and uncertainty (i.e., what has
2516   not happened but can happen, or what has happened but can also happen in a different way).
2517   Loss scenarios that include loss escalation and an estimation of the critical threshold for loss
2518   occurrence are helpful in making design decisions that incorporate loss margins. Loss scenarios
2519   also help to determine the limits of adversity-driven decisions due to uncertainty in knowledge
2520   about the adversity (i.e., the adversity is insufficiently known or understood or is just unknown).
2521   Sensitivity analyses must inform the determination of loss margins. Other factors for computing
2522   loss margins include system complexity, the use of newer technology or older technology in new
2523   ways, and the degree of new environments being introduced. An additional factor is the ability to
2524   complete comprehensive and effective testing. Limitations on system test coverage and
2525   effectiveness for all actual, simulated, or emulated adversity necessitate larger margins to
2526   account for the remaining uncertainty. The size of the margin may be reduced with time as
2527   unknown and underappreciated loss scenarios are uncovered and corrected, or the size may need
2528   to be increased over time as a malicious adversity capability matures in sophistication.

2530   E.25 MEDIATED ACCESS
2531   PRINCIPLE: All access to and operations on system elements are mediated.
2532   Note: Mediated access is a foundational principle in the design of secure systems. The purpose of
2533   mediated access is to achieve the following:
2534   •    Place limits on access to and use of the system
2535   •    Reduce the possibility of loss escalation
2536   •    Reduce the extent to which loss escalates and propagates
2537   Mediated access is based on the interaction between an entity and a target system element and
2538   has two aspects:
2539   •    Access to the System Element: The requesting entity only has authorized access to a target
2540        system element.
2541   •    Use of the System Element: The requesting entity is only allowed to perform authorized
2542        operations on the target system element.
2543   Mediated access has two parts: (1) a policy-based access mediation decision and (2) the
2544   enforcement of the access mediation decision. The access mediation decision may include
2545   conditional constraints that further restrict access (e.g., role, time of day, system state or mode,
2546   or duration of operation). If access is not sufficiently mediated, there is no possibility of limiting
2547   how system elements (including human and machine elements) interact to ensure that only
2548   authorized behaviors and intended outcomes result.
2549   Mediated access is achieved by an access mediation control mechanism. Seminal computer
2550   security work defined the reference validation mechanism as the generalized form of any
2551   mechanism that is an implementation of the reference monitor concept (Section D.4.2). The
2552   reference monitor provides the design assurance basis for demonstrating the trustworthiness of
2553   a mediated access control mechanism. The essential design criteria (Section D.4.2) provide a
2554   refinement to extend the generalized reference monitor concept. Mediated access may enforce
2555   the constraints described in the principles of Distributed Privilege, Least Privilege, and Least
2556   Sharing.
2557   Efficiently mediated access refers to using a least common mechanism for mediating access.
2558   Mediating access is often the predominant security function within a secure system and may
2559   result in performance bottle necks if not designed and implemented correctly. The use of least
2560   common mechanism is one means to help reduce bottle necks [Levin07].

2562   E.26 MINIMIZE DETECTABILITY
2563   PRINCIPLE: The design of the system minimizes the detectability of the system as much as
2564   practicable.
2565   Note: A system that is not discoverable, observable, or trackable by an adversarial threat or
2566   exposed to such a threat is less prone to a targeted attack. Minimizing detectability drives
2567   engineering design decisions to eliminate or reduce exposures such as unnecessary interfaces,

       APPENDIX E                                                                                     PAGE 111

2568   access points, footprints, and emanations, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial threat
2569   actions. Interfaces and access points have the effect of exposing the system to intentional
2570   adversity (i.e., attacks) and non-intentional adversity (i.e., faults, errors, incidents, accidents). Yet
2571   interfaces and access points are necessary to compose system elements to deliver required
2572   capabilities, and duplicating interfaces and access points is needed to avoid single points of failure.
2573   System design must balance the need for interfaces with the susceptibility that results from the
2574   interface being exposed, discovered, and observed. Every interface, whether internal or external,
2575   constitutes an exposure that must be considered.
2576   Minimizing detectability reduces the ability of an adversary to observe and discover information
2577   about the system to craft and execute attacks. This includes detecting a system’s location,
2578   presence, and movement (e.g., due to emissions, signatures, or footprints). Among ways a system
2579   may be detected include heat emission, electronic magnetic (EM) emissions, sound, vibrations,
2580   reflecting radar waves or light, the response to stimulus (e.g., a response to an Internet Control
2581   Message Protocol [ICMP] echo request or “ping”), and software traces and thrown exceptions.
2582   Specific forms or means to minimize detectability include camouflage, stealth, low probability of
2583   intercept/low probability of detect (LPI/LPD) waveforms (for radios), and frequency hopping.
2584   REFERENCES: [Bryant20]; [Ball03]; [SP 800-160v2].

2585   E.27 PROTECTIVE DEFAULTS
2586   PRINCIPLE: The default configuration of the system provides maximum protection effectiveness.
2587   Note: The configuration of the system includes the parameters for system functions, data,
2588   interfaces, and resources that determine how the system behaves and the outcomes it produces.
2589   Protective defaults guarantee that the “as shipped” system configuration and parameters
2590   prioritize the achievement of loss control objectives over the ability to deliver a required system
2591   capability and performance without dependence on human intervention. Protective defaults
2592   require conscientious action to establish the system configuration and parameters that deliver
2593   the required capability and performance in a manner that provides Commensurate Protection
2594   against loss. Protective default configurations for systems include constituent subsystems,
2595   components, and mechanisms. The principles of Protective Failure, Protective Recovery, and
2596   Continuous Protection parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover from
2597   failure.
2598   REFERENCES: [Saltzer75]; [Neumann04]; [Levin07].

2599   E.28 PROTECTIVE FAILURE
2600   PRINCIPLE: A failure of a system element neither results in an unacceptable loss nor invokes
2601   another loss scenario.
2602   Note: Protective failure, a generalization of the concepts of fail secure and fail safe, is the aspect
2603   of continuous protection that ensures that a protection capability is not interrupted during a
2604   failure and that the effect of the failure is constrained. Two aspects of protective failure must be
2605   satisfied to achieve the intended effect:
2606   •    Avoid Single Points of Failure: The failure of a single system element should not lead to
2607        unacceptable loss. Unacceptable loss should only occur in the case of multiple independent
2608        malfunctions – a safety principle known as single failure criterion. The principle of Defense in
2609        Depth can help achieve this aspect of protective failure.

       APPENDIX E                                                                                       PAGE 112

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2610   •    Avoid Propagation of New Failure: If unmitigated, failures in the system can result in
2611        propagating, cascading, or rippling effects on the system. These effects can be addressed if
2612        the remaining protections remain effective to prevent the originating failure from causing
2613        additional failures. The principle of Defense in Depth does not address the propagation of
2614        failure by invoking a new loss scenario and, therefore, does not help achieve this aspect of
2615        protective failure without added analysis.
2616   Protective failure applies to discrete system elements, aggregates of system elements, and the
2617   systems abstraction. Protective failure seeks to limit a failure’s effect to the extent practicable
2618   and, in doing so, minimize introducing new loss possibilities. Protective failure can limit the extent
2619   to which a failure is able to advance loss scenarios associated with the failure, including cascading
2620   losses; trigger a different loss scenario; or create a new loss scenario. Efforts to avoid or limit
2621   failures may themselves degrade system performance, a form of failure. Thus, system designers
2622   may need to consider trade spaces between possible adverse effects and system performance.
2623   REFERENCES: [Neumann04]; [Jackson13]; [Saleh14]; [Moller08]; [Levin07].

2624   E.29 PROTECTIVE RECOVERY
2625   PRINCIPLE: The recovery of a system element does not result in nor lead to unacceptable loss.
2626   Note: Protective recovery is an aspect of Continuous Protection that ensures that a protection
2627   capability is not interrupted during recovery from actual or impending failure. Protective recovery
2628   is applied to discrete system elements, aggregates of system elements, and the system. To the
2629   extent practicable, any recovery from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded,
2630   contingency or alternative operation, or the recovery of other asset losses should not (1) advance
2631   the loss scenario that is the target of the recovery, (2) trigger other loss scenarios, or (3) create
2632   new loss scenarios. The practicable aspect of this principle recognizes that for some recovery
2633   efforts to be successful, they may degrade system performance, which is a form of loss. Protective
2634   recovery is an aspect of the response strategy for the system. Thus, graduated and ungraduated
2635   considerations of Commensurate Response apply to best suit expediency in the need for a
2636   protective recovery.

2638   E.30 REDUNDANCY
2639   PRINCIPLE: The system design delivers the required capability by replication of system functions
2640   or elements.
2641   Note: Redundancy employs multiples of the same system elements, data and control flows, or
2642   paths to avoid single points of failure. Redundancy requires a strategy for how multiple system
2643   elements are used individually or in combination (e.g., load-balancing, fail-over, concurrently,
2644   backup, voting, agreement, consensus). Redundant solutions are susceptible to common mode
2645   failure (i.e., a single event that results in the same or equivalent elements failing in the same
2646   manner). The cause of the failure may occur with or without intent. Diversity is a means to address
2647   the concerns of common mode failure.

                                             APPLICATION OF DESIGN PRINCIPLES
             For commercial products to be trustworthy commensurate with their criticality, security design
             principles should be selected and applied appropriately throughout the products’ system life
             cycle. Each design principle must be assessed for its relevance, applicability, and validity. Several
             of the design principles described in this appendix have been demonstrated by industry in past
             work and were used to develop criteria in national and international standards (e.g., [TCSEC85]
             and [ISO 15408-1]). Some commercial products have been designed, developed, and evaluated
             against specifications from those standards up to and including the highest levels of assurance
             (e.g., [TCSEC85] Classes A1 and B3 and [ISO 15408-3] Evaluation Assurance Levels 6 and 7). These
             products, which were evaluated in accordance with well-defined assumptions and configuration
             constraints, represent use cases of trustworthy components that have been verified to be highly
             resistant to penetration from determined adversaries and, in the case of [TCSEC85] Class A1,
             distinguished by substantially dealing with the problem of subversion of security mechanisms.

2654   TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ASSURANCE
2655   REDUCING UNCERTAINTY AND BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM

2656   Determining that a system is trustworthy is based on the concept of assurance. Assurance is the
2657   grounds for justified confidence that a claim or set of claims has been or will be achieved [ISO
2658   15026-1]. Justified confidence is derived from objective evidence that reduces uncertainty to an
2659   acceptable level and in doing so, reduces risk (Section F.2). Evidence is acquired through applying
2660   engineering verification and validation methods. 83 The evidence must be relevant, accurate,
2661   credible, and of sufficient quantity to enable reasoned conclusions and consensus among subject-
2662   matter experts that the claims are satisfied. The relationship between evidence and claims can be
2663   represented in many ways. Section F.2 discusses these approaches.
2664


            “The trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and
            transparent that infrastructure is and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.”
            -- Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity [EO 14028]
              May 2021


2665
2666
2667   F.1 TRUST AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
2668   As discussed in Section 2.3, trust and trustworthiness are foundational concepts to engineering
2669   trustworthy secure systems, to the decisions made to grant trust, and to the extent which trust is
2670   granted based on demonstrated trustworthiness. Trust is a belief that an entity meets certain
2671   expectations and therefore, can be relied upon. A trustworthy entity requires sufficient evidence
2672   to support its trustworthiness claims. Trustworthiness is demonstrated based on evidence that
2673   supports a stated claim or judgment of being worthy to be trusted [Schroeder77] [Neumann04]
2674   [Levin07].

2675   Trust in an entity can occur without a basis for or knowledge of the entity’s trustworthiness. Trust
2676   may occur because: (1) there is no alternative (e.g., an individual trusts the components involved
2677   in an Internet transaction without knowing anything about the components), (2) the need for
2678   trustworthiness is not realized and occurs de facto, or (3) other reasons [Neumann17]. Since trust
2679   is not necessarily based on a judgment of trustworthiness, the decision to trust an entity should
2680   consider the consequences, effects, and impacts of trust expectations not being fulfilled because
2681   of non-performance, whether due to failure, deficiency, or incompetence. The criteria to grant
2682   trust is used to determine the trustworthiness of an entity. Trust granted without establishing the
2683   required trustworthiness is a significant contributor to risk.

2684   F.1.1 Roles of Requirements in Trustworthiness
2685   Trustworthiness judgments are based on criteria that express the need to trust. This need must
2686   be transformed into requirements in the same way that capability, performance, security, and

       83 These methods include combinations of demonstration, inspection, analysis, and testing.



       APPENDIX F                                                                                              PAGE 115
       NIST SP 800-160v1r1 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                 ENGINEERING TRUSTWORTHY SECURE SYSTEMS
       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2687   other needs are transformed into requirements. The trustworthiness judgments are meaningful
2688   only to the extent that the trustworthiness-relevant requirements accurately reflect the problem,
2689   accurately define the solution, and can be verified as being satisfied by the solution.

2690   The trustworthiness requirements about security derive from the protection needs, priorities,
2691   constraints, and concerns associated with the system’s ability to achieve authorized and intended
2692   behaviors and outcomes, deal with adversity, and control loss. The requirements also address the
2693   measures used to assess trustworthiness and the evidentiary data required to substantiate
2694   trustworthiness conclusions and consequently granting trust. The requirements engineering
2695   discipline provides the methods, processes, techniques, and tools for this to occur.
2696


             “A meaningful claim of trustworthiness cannot be based on an isolated demonstration that the
             system contains protection capability assumed to be effective or sufficient. Instead, conclusions
             about protection capability must have their basis on evidence that the system was properly
             specified, designed, and implemented with the rigor needed to deliver system-level function, in a
             manner deemed to be trustworthy and secure.” [Neumann04]

2697
2698
2699   F.1.2 Design Considerations
2700   The design for a trustworthy secure system requires the application of principled engineering
2701   concepts and methods supported by evidence that provides assurance that all security-relevant
2702   claims about the system are satisfied (Section F.2). 84 Some considerations that apply to achieving
2703   trustworthiness in system design are:
2704   •    Composition
2705        Trustworthiness judgments themselves are compositional. They must align with how the set
2706        of composed elements provides a system capability. The way that the system is composed
2707        from its system elements must include the design principles of Compositional Trustworthiness
2708        and Structured Decomposition and Composition to the extent practical.
2709   •    States, Modes, and Transitions
2710        Ideally, the implemented system design will result in a system that continually remains in
2711        secure states and modes, with secure transitions between states and modes (Section 3.2).
2712        Realistically, the system will have insecure and indeterminant (unknown if secure or insecure)
2713        systems states and modes. The design must account for these cases and provide the capability
2714        to transition from insecure and indeterminant states and modes to secure states and modes
2715        (see Protective Recovery).
2716   •    Failure Propagation
2717        All systems fail at some point. When a failure occurs, another failure scenario or the creation
2718        of a new failure scenario should not be triggered or invoked (see Protective Failure). Design

       84 Constraints and claims are expressed in terms of functional correctness, strength of function, concerns for asset loss

       and consequences, and the protection capability derived from adherence to standards or from the use of specific
       processes, procedures, or methods.


       APPENDIX F                                                                                                      PAGE 116

2719        without single points of failure (see Redundancy), including not having common mode failures
2720        (see Diversity), can help isolate system element failures while providing the required system
2721        capabilities. Additionally, the response to failure should not lead to loss or other failures (see
2722        Protective Recovery).
2723   •    Anomaly Detection
2724        Anomaly Detection provides situational awareness that allows the system to decide and
2725        recommend corrective actions to account for actual and potential deviations from accepted
2726        norms.
2727   •    Trades
2728        Not every system element has the trustworthiness that is sufficient for its intended purpose.
2729        A deficiency in trustworthiness can result from:
2730        -     Technical feasibility and practicality issues
2731        -     Cost and schedule issues of what is feasible and practical
2732        -     The limits of certainty (i.e., what is not known, what cannot be known, and what is
2733              underappreciated [known or could be known but dismissed prematurely])

2734        The trade space is the rigorous application of the design principles that provide a basis for the
2735        necessary design decisions to maximize the trustworthiness of individual system elements
2736        and aggregates of elements that must be trusted. For example, in addressing the feasibility
2737        and practicality of cost and schedule issues, the design principle of minimizing the number of
2738        system elements that must be trusted (see Minimal Trusted Elements) is applied. This reduces
2739        the effort’s size and scope and potentially reduces the expense to generate evidence of
2740        trustworthiness.

2741   F.2 ASSURANCE
2742   Assurance is the grounds for justified confidence that a claim or set of claims has been or will be
2743   achieved [ISO 15026-1]. Assurance is a complex and multi-dimensional property of the system
2744   that builds over time. Assurance must be planned, established, and maintained in alignment with
2745   the system throughout the system life cycle.

2746   Adequate security judgements should be based on the level of confidence in the ability of the
2747   system to protect itself against asset loss and the associated consequences across all forms of
2748   adversity. 85 It cannot be based solely on individual efforts, such as demonstrating compliance,
2749   functional testing, or adversarial penetration tests. Judgments include what the system cannot
2750   do, will not do, or cannot be forced to do. These judgments of non-behavior must be grounded in
2751   sufficient confidence in the system’s ability to correctly deliver its intended function in the
2752   presence and absence of adversity and to do so when used in accordance with its design intent.

2753   The needed evidentiary basis for such judgments derives from well-formed and comprehensive
2754   evidence-producing activities that address the requirements, design, properties, capabilities,
2755   vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of security functions. Testing is one of several verification

       85 The term adversity refers to those conditions that can cause a loss of assets (e.g., threats, attacks, vulnerabilities,

       hazards, disruptions, and exposures).

2756   activities. The evidence acquired from these activities informs reasoning by qualified subject-
2757   matter experts to interpret the evidence to substantiate the assurance claims made while
2758   considering other emergent properties that the system may possess.

2759

                                                      VENEER SECURITY
             Assurance is difficult but necessary.
             “I’ve covered a lot of material in this book, some of it quite tricky. But I’ve left the hardest parts
             to the last. First, there’s the question of assurance …“ [Anderson20].
             Veneer security is security functionality provided without corresponding assurance so that the
             functionality only appears to protect resources when, in fact, it does not. Veneer security results
             in a false sense of security and, in fact, increases risk due to the uncertainty about the behavior
             and outcomes produced by the security functionality in the presence and absence of adversity.
             Veneer security must be avoided [Saydjari18].
             Compliance is a form of “veneer security.” While compliance may have an important informing
             role in judgments of trustworthiness, compliance-based judgments – like other forms of veneer
             security – do not suffice as the sole evidentiary basis for assurance and the associated judgments
             of trustworthiness.

2760
2761
2762   F.2.1 Security Assurance Claims
2763   From a security perspective, a top-level claim addresses freedom from the conditions that cause
2764   asset loss and the associated consequences by ensuring the system achieves only authorized and
2765   intended system behaviors and outcomes. Supporting claims include the completeness and
2766   accuracy of stakeholder and system requirements, a sound approach to design, the proper
2767   implementation of the design, and the proper use and maintenance of the system.

2768   When applied to security, the top-level claim is that the system will adequately contribute to
2769   freedom from the conditions that cause asset loss and the associated consequences. The top-
2770   level security claim decomposes into claims about the design, implementation, requirements,
2771   methods, and adversities in a structured manner that demonstrates that the design adequately
2772   contributes to ensuring only authorized and intended system behaviors and outcomes.

2773   Security assurance claims reflect the desired attributes of a trustworthy secure system. These
2774   claims are derived from concerns about the completeness and accuracy of stakeholder and
2775   system requirements, 86 enforcement of the security policy, proper implementation of the design,
2776   proper maintenance of the system, the usability of the system, 87 and the avoidance, minimization,



       86 Claims are not expressed solely as a restatement of the security functional and performance requirements. Doing so

       only provides assurance that the security requirements are satisfied with the implicit assumption that the requirements
       are correct, provide adequate coverage, and accurately reflect stakeholder needs and concerns.
       87 Most system failures have a human component. Thus, assurance must consider human frailty [Anderson20]. Operator

       behavior is a product of the environment (including its systems) in which it occurs [Leveson11].


       APPENDIX F                                                                                                    PAGE 118

2777   and mitigation of defects, errors, and vulnerabilities. 88 Other claims may exist involving the ability
2778   to exhibit predictable behavior while operating in secure states in the presence and absence of
2779   adversity and the ability to recover from an insecure state. Claims can be expressed in terms of
2780   functional correctness, strength of function, and the protection capability derived from the
2781   adherence to standards and/or from the use of specific processes, procedures, and methods.

2782

                                                      LEARNING FROM SAFETY
                The NASA System Safety Handbook [NASA11] describes the relevant claims to be met in terms
                of the top-level claim that the system is adequately safe with subclaims, including the system is
                designed to be as safe as reasonably practicable, built to be as safe as reasonably practicable,
                and operated as safely as reasonably practicable.

2783
2784
2785   F.2.2 Approaches to Assurance
2786   There are three general approaches to assurance. These approaches can vary based on type of
2787   evidence, how the evidence is acquired, the strength of the judgments made based on the
2788   evidence, and the extent to which the assurance matches decision-making needs. From weakest
2789   to strongest, the assurance approaches are axiomatic, analytic, and synthetic.
2790   •    Axiomatic Assurance (assurance by assertion) is based on beliefs accepted on faith in an
2791        artifact or process. The beliefs are often accepted because they are not contradicted by
2792        experiment or demonstration. Axiomatic assurance is not suited to complex scenarios.
2793        -      Demonstration of conformance and compliance are types of axiomatic assurance. While
2794               useful, they are not well-suited as the sole basis of assurance for complex scenarios.
2795   •    Analytic Assurance (assurance by test and analysis) derives from testing or reasoning to
2796        justify conclusions about properties of interest. Belief is relocated from an artifact or process
2797        to trust in some method of analysis. The feasibility of establishing an analytic basis depends
2798        on the amount of work involved in performing the analysis and on the soundness of any
2799        assumptions underlying that analysis. Analytic methods are most relevant in a model that
2800        spans all relevant uses and all interfaces to the environment. That is, the model must not
2801        ignore too many details.
2802        -      Testing demonstrates the presence but not the absence of errors and vulnerabilities.
2803               Testing and analyses will have uncertainty that cannot be ignored, especially when they
2804               lack comprehensiveness. Uncertainty contributes to risk.



       88 Not all vulnerabilities can be mitigated to an acceptable level. There are three classes of vulnerabilities in systems

       including: (1) vulnerabilities whose existence is known and either eliminated or made to be inconsequential, (2)
       vulnerabilities whose existence is known but that are not sufficiently mitigated, and (3) unknown vulnerabilities that
       constitute an element of uncertainty. That is, the fact that the vulnerability has not been identified should not give
       increased confidence that the vulnerability does not exist. Determining the effect of vulnerabilities that are in the
       delivered system and the risk posed by those vulnerabilities and accepting uncertainty about the existence of a
       vulnerability that will only become known over time are important aspects that are addressed by assurance.

       ________________________________________________________________________________________________


2805   •    Synthetic Assurance (assurance by structured reasoning) derives from the method of
2806        composition of the “components of assurance” (i.e., the assurance derives from the manner
2807        of synthesis of the constituent parts). It requires that assurance be a consideration at every
2808        step of design and implementation, from the smallest components to the final subsystem
2809        realization.
2810        -      The assurance case described in [ISO 15026-2] is an example of structured reasoning (see
2811               Section 4.3). Structured reasoning serves to fill the gaps associated with the axiomatic
2812               and analytic assurance approaches. Since synthetic assurance is based on the expert
2813               judgment of available evidence, it is not complete. However, synthetic assurance does
2814               further reduce uncertainty and thus reduces risk.

2815   Assurance depends on the quality of the evidence used in arguments demonstrating claims about
2816   the system are satisfied. Assurance evidence can be obtained directly through measurement,
2817   testing, observation, or inspection or obtained indirectly through analysis, including the analysis
2818   of data obtained from measurement, testing, observation, or inspection. Evidence must have
2819   sufficient quality in accuracy, credibility, relevance, rigor, and quantity. The accuracy, credibility,
2820   and relevance of evidence should be confirmed prior to its use. For example, some evidence can
2821   support arguments for strength of function, others for negative requirements (i.e., what will not
2822   happen), and still other evidence for qualitative properties.

2823

                                                      ASSURANCE CASE
                An assurance case is a reasoned, auditable artifact that is created to support the contention that
                a top-level claim is satisfied. The assurance case includes systematic argumentation, evidence,
                and explicit assumptions that support the claim.
                An assurance case contains the following elements [ISO 15026-2]:
                    •    One or more claims about properties
                    •    Arguments that logically link the evidence and any assumptions
                    •    A body of evidence
                    •    Justification of the choice of a top-level claim and the method of reasoning
                [NASA17] found that assurance cases have numerous advantages over other means for obtaining
                confidence, such as in the areas of comprehension, informing needed allocation responsibilities,
                information organization, and robust due diligence. These advantages were larger in areas with
                otherwise insufficient methods to achieve high assurance. Additionally, assurance cases were
                determined to be more efficient for complex and novel systems, as well as systems in need of
                high assurance.
                Many formalizations and tools for building assurance cases have been developed in recent years,
                including the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) [GSNCS18] and NASA’s AdvoCATE: Assurance Case
                Automation Toolset [NASA19].

2825   F.2.3 Assurance Needs
2826   Assurance is a need that is engineered and satisfied similar to the need to engineer the system
2827   capability to satisfy specified capability needs. Assurance needs for trustworthy secure systems
2828   are grounded in the concerns of loss and adverse effects due to intentional and unintentional
2829   adversity (Commensurate Rigor, Commensurate Trustworthiness, Substantiated Trustworthiness).
2830   Assurance needs include the evidence-basis for reasoning, the degree of rigor to acquire and
2831   interpret the evidence, and the selection of the methods, tools, and processes used throughout
2832   the system life cycle. Similar to capability and performance needs, assurance needs, expectations,
2833   priorities, and constraints should be expressed as system requirements and achieved, tracked,
2834   and maintained within the systems engineering effort.

2835

                                                 CONFIDENCE MAY BE NEGATIVE
             Assurance evidence can support a conclusion that a stated claim is not achieved or that there is an
             insufficient basis to conclude that the claim is supported or not supported. In either case, the
             assurance is negative relative to the goal of substantiating the claim. That is, the system or some
             part of the system is not sufficiently trustworthy and should not be trusted relative to its
             specified function without further action.

2836
2837
2838   Assurance needs determine the type of evidence and the rigor associated with the activities,
2839   methods, and tools used to acquire the evidence to satisfy the following cases:
2840   •    What is to be accomplished in the systems engineering effort: The realization of the design
2841        for a secure system
2842   •    The means to conduct the systems engineering effort: The methods, processes, and tools
2843        employed (driven by rigor and assurance objectives) to realize the design for a secure system
2844   •    The results of the systems engineering effort: The substantiated effectiveness of the realized
2845        design of the secure system

2846   Assurance needs can vary and constitute a trade space that must be managed similar to how
2847   capability and performance needs can vary. The degree of rigor is the primary means of varying
2848   assurance. As shown in Figure F-1, a direct relationship exists between the degree of rigor and
2849   assurance and the stakeholder’s assessment of the effects of asset loss. The assurance trade space
2850   includes the following considerations:
2851   •    Cost, schedule, and performance
2852   •    Architecture and design decisions
2853   •    Selection of technology and solutions
2854   •    Selection and employment of methods and tools
2855   •    Qualifications necessary for subject-matter experts

2856   Requirements analysis across stakeholder and system requirements determines the threshold
2857   degree of rigor that is required. When a system cannot practicably meet the needed degrees of
2858   rigor, stakeholders should have a means to determine if they will accept the associated risk.

2862   The highest levels of rigor across systems often requires formal methods—techniques that model
2863   systems as mathematical entities to enable rigorous verification of the system’s properties
2864   through mathematical proofs. Formal methods depend on formal specifications (i.e., statements
2865   in a language whose vocabulary, syntax, and semantics are formally defined) and a variety of
2866   models including a formal security policy model (i.e., a mathematically rigorous specification of a
2867   system's security policy [Appendix C]).

2868   Due to the cost and complexity associated with formal methods, such methods are typically
2869   limited to engineering efforts where only the highest levels of assurance are needed, such as the
2870   formal modeling, specification, and verification of security policy and the implementation that
2871   enforces the policy (Section D.4.2). In this case, the security policy model is verified as complete
2872   for its scope of control and as self-consistent. The verified security policy model then serves as a
2873   foundation to verify the models of the design and implementation of the mechanisms providing
2874   for decision-making and the enforcement of those decisions.

                             DOES DEFENSE IN DEPTH INCREASE TRUSTWORTHINESS?
             “The notion of defense in depth describes security derived from the application of multiple
             mechanisms (e.g., to create a series of barriers against an attack by an adversary). However,
             there is no theoretical basis to assume that defense in depth, in and of itself, could imply a level
             of trustworthiness greater than that of the individual security components. Without a sound
             security architecture and supporting theory, the nonconstructive nature of these approaches
             renders them equivalent to temporary patches.” [Levin07]
             Moreover, [Saleh14] notes that poorly designed defense in depth layering can conceal emerging
             dangerous system states and conditions. For more information on the proper use of the principle
             for trustworthy secure design, Defense In Depth, see Appendix E.

2880   SECURITY IN SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES

2881   This appendix provides an overview of the system life cycle processes in [ISO 15288] and sets up
2882   the in-depth coverage of those processes in subsequent appendices. It also describes relevant
2883   relationships among the various process groups and processes (Section G.2).

2884   G.1 PROCESS OVERVIEW
2885   [ISO 15288] groups the activities performed during the system life cycle into four process groups:
2886   Technical Processes (Appendix H), Technical Management Processes (Appendix I), Organizational
2887   Project-Enabling Processes (Appendix J), and Agreement Processes (Appendix K). Appendices H, I,
2888   J, and K describe the considerations and contributions to the system life cycle processes to achieve
2889   trustworthy secure systems. Figure G-1 lists the four process groups and the processes in each
2890   group.

2894   The security-relevant considerations and contributions to the system life cycle are provided as
2895   systems security engineering tasks. The tasks are aligned with the engineering viewpoints of the
2896   life cycle processes and are based on the foundational security and trust principles and concepts
2897   described in Chapter Two, Appendix C, Appendix D, Appendix E, and Appendix F. The tasks use
2898   and leverage the principles, concepts, terms, and practices of systems engineering to facilitate
2899   consistency in their application as part of a systems engineering effort.

2900   The system life cycles processes, activities, and tasks are to be applied as needed. They are not
2901   dependent on, oriented to, or presumed to be used or needed in any specific system development
2902   methodology. By design, the processes and their activities and tasks can be applied concurrently,
2903   iteratively, or recursively at any level in the structural hierarchy of a system with the appropriate
2904   fidelity and rigor and at any stage in the system life cycle in accordance with acquisition, systems
2905   engineering, or other process models. Using their expertise and experience, practitioners should
2906   tailor the life cycle processes, activities, and tasks to achieve optimized and efficient results. 89
2907   Considerations include:
2908   •    How the system life cycle processes apply within the development models used by an
2909        organization
2910   •    The ordering or sequencing of the activities and tasks in the system life cycle processes
2911   •    How the outcomes may be achieved in ways that do not strictly adhere to the presentation
2912        of the processes in this publication
2913   •    Additional activities and tasks needed to achieve specific outcomes
2914   •    The size, scope, and complexity of the system
2915   •    The need to accommodate specific technologies, methods, or techniques used to develop the
2916        system

2917   Tailoring the system life cycle processes allows the engineering team to:
2918   •    Optimize applying the processes in response to technological, programmatic, acquisition,
2919        process, procedural, system life cycle stage, or other objectives and constraints
2920   •    Allow for concurrently applying the processes by sub-teams focused on different parts of the
2921        same engineering effort
2922   •    Facilitate applying the processes to conform with a variety of system development
2923        methodologies, processes, and models (e.g., agile, spiral, waterfall) that could be used on a
2924        single engineering effort
2925   •    Accommodate the need for unanticipated or other event-driven execution of processes to
2926        resolve issues and respond to changes that occur during the engineering effort

2927   While the life cycle processes and activities are restated from [ISO 15288], the tasks stated in this
2928   publication are neither a restatement of nor a one-for-one mapping to the tasks in [ISO 15288].

       89 Tailoring can occur as part of the project planning process at the start of the systems engineering effort or in an ad

       hoc manner at any time during the engineering effort when situations and circumstances so dictate. Understanding the
       fundamentals of systems security engineering (i.e., the science underpinning the discipline) helps to inform the tailoring
       process whenever it occurs during the system life cycle. The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook provides additional
       guidance on how to tailor the systems engineering processes [INCOSE14].

2929   This publication focuses on the security contributions to the processes. The tasks are titled to
2930   reflect these contributions. In some cases, tasks have been added to address the range of
2931   outcomes appropriate for achieving trustworthy secure system objectives.

2932   The descriptions of the system life cycle processes assume that sufficient time, funding, and
2933   human and material resources are available to ensure the complete application of the processes
2934   within the systems engineering effort. The processes represent the “standard of excellence”
2935   within which appropriate tailoring is accomplished to achieve realistic, optimal, and cost-effective
2936   results within the constraints imposed on the engineering team.

2937   Each of the system life cycle processes contains a set of activities and tasks that produce a set of
2938   security-focused outcomes. 90 These outcomes combine to deliver a system and corresponding
2939   body of evidence that serve as the basis to:
2940   •    Substantiate the security and the trustworthiness of the system
2941   •    Determine security risk across stakeholder concerns and with respect to the use of the system
2942        in support of mission or business objectives
2943   •    Help stakeholders decide which operational constraints are necessary to mitigate security risk
2944   •    Provide inputs to other processes associated with delivering the system
2945   •    Support the system throughout the stages of its life cycle 91

2946   Each system life cycle process description has the following sections:
2947   •    Life Cycle Purpose: Describes the goals of performing the process [ISO 15288]
2948   •    Security Purpose: Establishes what the process achieves from the security standpoint
2949   •    Security Outcomes: Expresses the security-relevant observable results expected from the
2950        successful performance of the process and the data generated by the process
2951   •    Security Activities and Tasks: Provides a set of security-relevant tasks that support achieving
2952        security outcomes for the process 92

2953   The following naming convention is established for the system life cycle processes. Each process
2954   is identified by a two-character designation (e.g., BA is the official designation for the Business or
2955   Mission Analysis process). Table G-1 lists the system life cycle processes and their associated two-
2956   character designators.




       90 Outcomes inform other processes including those external to the engineering effort such as the organizational life

       cycle processes of stakeholders and certification, authorization, or regulatory processes.
       91 The body of evidence’s comprehensiveness, depth, fidelity, credibility, and relevance are factors in achieving the

       desired level of assurance. The objective is a body of evidence sufficient to convince stakeholders that their assurance
       needs are satisfied.
       92 The tasks are accomplished cooperatively within and across various roles of the organization, inclusive of systems

       security engineering. While this publication focuses on the scope and responsibility of systems security engineering, it
       is not the case that all aspects of every task are fulfilled by systems security engineering.

2959   The activities and tasks in each system life cycle process are uniquely identified using a two-
2960   character designation followed by a numerical designation. For example, the first activity in the
2961   Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process is designated SN-1. The first two tasks
2962   within SN-1 are designated SN-1.1 and SN-1.2, respectively. The identification of the activities and
2963   tasks within each system life cycle process provides for precise referencing and traceability among
2964   the process elements. Task descriptions may contain a notes section that provides additional
2965   information on considerations relevant to the successful execution of that task. A references
2966   section provides a list of pertinent publications related to the activity and is a source of content
2967   for additional information. Finally, a related publications section provides a list of documents that
2968   are related to the topic being addressed in the activity.

2969   Note that the outcomes described in this publication are achieved by personnel, processes, and
2970   technology. Personnel conduct activities and tasks, such as those defined in the [ISO 15288]
2971   system life cycle processes, to produce outcomes that achieve the defined security objectives. No
2972   single personnel role is responsible for producing all outcomes stated in the system life cycle
2973   processes (i.e., the life cycle processes are not role-specific). Thus, multiple roles may contribute
2974   to a specific outcome.

2975   Finally, this publication describes the systems engineering considerations, not the engineering
2976   responsibilities, to produce the specified outcomes. Systems engineering responsibilities reside
2977   with the organizations using this guidance, facilitating maximum flexibility for organizations to
2978   define, combine, and allocate responsibility to support executing the life cycle processes. No role
2979   or title is assigned any specific responsibility or possesses any specific authority. Figure G-2
2980   provides an example of the types of personnel and roles that support the system life cycle
2981   processes. Each personnel category has a scope of authority, control, and responsibility and a
2982   variety of roles that collectively achieve the outcomes for the category. Collectively, the outcomes
2983   produced across all categories achieve the defined security objectives.

3030   Process relationships are further illustrated by the “use cases” in [ISO 24748-2]. Three prominent
3031   use cases include:
3032        •     Establish a formal agreement (ISO 24748-2, Section 6.7.1)
3033              - Agreements between organizations, between projects, and for work efforts within a
3034                  project
3035              -    Commonly a formal contract between an acquirer and the supplier, including a prime
3036                   contractor and its subcontractors
3037        •     Satisfy an agreement (ISO 24748-2, Section 6.7.1.2)
3038              - Processes to satisfy the agreement, including information a supplying organization
3039                  provides the acquiring organization to ensure compliance with the agreement
3040        •     Engineer a system of interest (ISO 24748-2, Section 6.7.4) 93
3041              - Relationships among the technical processes (Appendix H)
3042              - This use case often supports satisfying an agreement

3043   For more information on system life cycle processes and their relationships, refer to [ISO 15288],
3044   [IEEE 15288-1], [ISO 24748-1], [ISO 24748-2], [ISO 21840], [INCOSE14], and [SEBoK]. [ISO 12207]
3045   discusses the processes for software intensive systems. [NASA07], [NASA16], and [NASA18] may
3046   also be helpful.




       93 The application of technical processes for engineering a system of interest will occur recursively to realize subsystems

       and system elements. See Annex A of [ISO 24748-1] for additional details.

3051   considerations and contributions for the purpose, outcomes, activities, and tasks. The processes
3052   include:
3053   •    Business and Mission Analysis
3054   •    Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
3055   •    System Requirements Definition
3056   •    System Architecture Definition
3057   •    Design Definition
3058   •    System Analysis
3059   •    Implementation
3060   •    Integration
3061   •    Verification

3063   •    Validation
3064   •    Operation
3065   •    Maintenance
3066   •    Disposal

3067   As noted in Section G.2, the application of these processes at any life cycle stage is described in
3068   [ISO 24748‐1]. It has a complete set of example stages and stage outcomes for enacting technical
3069   processes within system and software life cycles.

3070   H.1 BUSINESS OR MISSION ANALYSIS
3071   The purpose of the Business or Mission Analysis process is to define the overall strategic problem
3072   or opportunity, characterize the solution space, and determine potential solution class(es) that
3073   can address a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.

3228   SN-5       ANALYZE STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS
3229              SN-5.1 Analyze the set of stakeholder requirements with respect to the protection needs.
3230              Note: The stakeholder requirements are analyzed to determine if the protection needs are
3231              accurately and comprehensively expressed in both individual requirements and the set of
3232              requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements: (1) are necessary,
3233              complete, succinct, and implementation-free, and (2) comprehensively address the protection
3234              needs.
3235              SN-5.2 Define security-relevant performance and assurance measures that enable the
3236                     assessment of technical achievement and their relative criticality.
3237              Note: Determining the relative criticality of measures (e.g., measures of effectiveness) captures
3238              technical achievements and reflects stakeholder priorities.
3239              SN-5.3 Provide feedback to applicable stakeholders from the analyzed requirements to validate
3240                     that their protection needs and expectations have been adequately captured and
3241                     expressed.
3242              SN-5.4 Resolve stakeholder requirements issues related to protection needs.
3243              Note: Any change to stakeholder requirements signifies a need to reassess protection needs and
3244              determine if any subsequent changes are required.

3274   SR-1       PREPARE FOR SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION
3275              SR-1.1 Define the security aspects of the intended behavior and outcomes at the functional
3276                     boundary of the system.
3277              Note: The intended behavior and security properties to be realized at the functional boundary
3278              consider the characteristics of the capability provided or used, the characteristics of the entities
3279              that interact with the system of interest at the functional boundary, and the associated assurance
3280              needs.
3281              SR-1.2 Define the security domains of the system and their correlation to the functional
3282                     boundaries of the system.

3292   SR-2       DEFINE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
3293              SR-2.1 Define each security function that the system is required to perform.
3294              Note: Security functions are defined for all system states, modes, and conditions of system
3295              operation and use, including the associated transitions between system states and modes. Security
3296              functions include those oriented to delivery of capability and the ability of the system to execute
3297              while preserving its inherent security characteristics.
3298              SR-2.2 Define the security aspects of each function that the system is required to perform.
3299              Note: This includes the need for other system functions to be non-interfering (Section D.4.1).
3300              SR-2.3 Define necessary security-driven implementation constraints.
3301              Note: Security-driven constraints on the system are from adversity, uncertainty, and risk,
3302              considering performance objectives and assurance needs. These constraints are informed by
3303              stakeholder requirements, the system architecture definition, and solution limitations across the
3304              life cycle.

3305              SR-2.4 Define necessary constraints on security implementation.
3306              Note: Constraints on security implementation are to satisfy expectations for non-security
3307              capability and performance.
3308              SR-2.5 Define system security requirements and rationale.
3309              Note: System security requirements include security capability and functional requirements,
3310              security performance and effectiveness requirements, security assurance requirements, and
3311              implementation constraints (SR-2.3 and SR-2.4 outcomes expressed as requirements).
3312              SR-2.6 Apply security metadata to the system security requirements.
3313              Note: Metadata enables identification and traceability to support analysis of completeness and
3314              consistency to determine security impact when requirements change.

3320              Note: Requirements are analyzed to ensure that individual and combinations of requirements fully
3321              and properly capture security protection and security-constraint considerations. Rationale is
3322              captured to support analysis conclusions and provides a basis to conclude that the analysis has the
3323              proper perspective and is fully aware of assumptions made. See Appendix C.
3324              SR-3.2 Define security-driven performance and assurance measures that enable the assessment
3325                     of technical achievement.
3326              Note: Each security-driven performance measure (e.g., measure of performance and technical
3327              performance measure) is analyzed to help ensure that system requirements are met and project
3328              cost, schedule, or performance risk associated with any non-compliance is identified.

3593              (with or without modification). If the strategy is reuse, then the project needs to determine the
3594              extent, source, suitability, and trustworthiness for the purpose of the reused system elements. The
3595              implementation strategy includes procedures, fabrication processes, tools and equipment,
3596              tolerances, and verification uncertainties, which may introduce weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In
3597              the case of repeated system element implementation (e.g., mass production, replacement system
3598              elements), the procedures and fabrication processes are defined to achieve consistent and
3599              repeatable trustworthy producibility.
3600              Note 2: The security aspects are informed by the targeted level of assurance, security verification
3601              uncertainties, and security concerns associated with implementation-related logistics, supply, and
3602              distribution of components.

3614   IP-2       PERFORM IMPLEMENTATION
3615              IP-2.1     Realize or adapt system elements in accordance with the security aspects of the
3616                         implementation strategy and implementation procedures, as well as security-relevant
3617                         constraints.
3618              Note: System elements can include:
3619              -    Hardware and Software: Hardware and software elements are either acquired or fabricated.
3620                   Custom hardware fabrication and software development enable insight into the details of
3621                   design and implementation. These insights often translate to increased assurance.
3622                   Acquired hardware and software elements may not provide the opportunity to achieve the
3623                   same insight into design and implementation and may offer more functionality and capability
3624                   than required. The limits of what can be known about the internals of the elements translate
3625                   to a level of uncertainty about vulnerability and to the maximum assurance that can be
3626                   achieved.
3627              -    Firmware: Firmware exhibits properties of hardware and software. Firmware elements may
3628                   be acquired or may be developed to realize the software aspects and then fabricated to realize
3629                   the physical form of the hardware aspects. Firmware elements, therefore, adhere to the
3630                   security implementation considerations of both hardware and software elements.
3631              -    Services: System elements implemented by obtaining or leasing services are subject to the
3632                   same criteria used to acquire hardware, firmware, and software but must also address security
3633                   considerations associated with utilization and support resources.
3634              -    Utilization and Support Resources: The security considerations of services acquired or leased
3635                   account for the specific roles and responsibilities of individuals of the service/lease provider
3636                   and their ability to account for all of the security requirements and constraints associated with
3637                   the delivery, utilization, and sustainment of the service or capability being leased.
3638              IP-2.2     Place the system element in a secure state for future use, as needed.
3639              Note: This includes protection of the element while stored and in transit, as well as the packaging
3640              and labeling of the element.
3641              IP-2.3     Record objective evidence that system elements meet the system security requirements.

3815   Security Activities and Tasks

3816   TR-1       PREPARE FOR TRANSITION
3817              TR-1.1 Define the security aspects of the transition strategy.
3818              Note: The transition strategy includes all security-relevant activities, from site delivery and
3819              installation through deployment and commissioning of the system, as well as all security-relevant
3820              stakeholders, including human operators. The strategy also includes security roles and
3821              responsibilities, facilities security considerations, secure shipping and receiving, contingency back
3822              out plans, security training, security aspects of installation acceptance demonstration tasks, secure
3823              operational readiness reviews, secure operations commencement, transition security success
3824              criteria, rights of secure access, data rights, and integration with other plans. System
3825              commissioning is considered along with the secure decommissioning of the old system when one
3826              exists. In this case, the Transition and Disposal processes are used concurrently.
3827              TR-1.2 Identify and define any security-relevant facility or site changes needed.
3828              TR-1.3 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives from the security aspects of
3829                     transition to be incorporated into the system requirements, architecture, and design.
3830              TR-1.4 Identify and arrange the security training of operators, users, and other stakeholders
3831                     necessary to the system utilization and support.
3832              TR-1.5 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
3833                     transition.
3834              TR-1.6 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security aspects
3835                     of transition.

3842   TR-2       PERFORM TRANSITION
3843              TR-2.1 Prepare the site of operation in accordance with secure installation requirements.
3844              TR-2.2 Securely deliver the system for installation at the correct location and time.
3845              Note: Secure delivery considers the various forms, means, and methods that accomplish end-to-
3846              end transport of system elements to ensure that system elements are not tampered with during
3847              transport. Items and packages are delivered to the intended recipient and only to the intended
3848              recipient, which may mean shipping with more lead time to account for additional security.
3849              TR-2.3 Install the system in its operational environment in accordance with the secure
3850                     installation strategy and establish secure interconnections to its environment.
3851              TR-2.4 Demonstrate trustworthy secure system installation.
3852              Note: The installation and connection procedures are to be properly verified to provide confidence
3853              that the intended system configuration across all system modes and states is achieved. This
3854              includes completing acceptance tests defined in agreements. These tests include security aspects
3855              associated with physical connections between the system and the environment.
3856              TR-2.5 Provide security training for the operators, users, and other stakeholders necessary for
3857                     system utilization and support.
3858              TR-2.6 Perform security activation and checkout of the system.
3859              Note: Security activation and checkout shows that the system can initialize to its initial secure
3860              operational state for all defined modes of operation and accounts for all interconnections to other
3861              systems across physical, virtual, and wireless interfaces.
3862              TR-2.7 Demonstrate that the installed system can deliver its required functions in a trustworthy
3863                     secure manner.
3864              TR-2.8 Demonstrate that the security functions provided by the system and the effects of the
3865                     security functions are sustainable by enabling systems.
3866              TR-2.9 Review the security trustworthiness of the system for operational readiness.
3867              Note: The results of installation, operational, and enabling system checkouts are reviewed to
3868              determine if the security performance and effectiveness are sufficient to justify operational use.
3869              TR-2.10 Commission the system for secure operation.
3870              Note: This includes providing security support to users and operators at the time of the system
3871              commissioning.

3903   Security Activities and Tasks

3904   VA-1       PREPARE FOR VALIDATION
3905              VA-1.1 Identify the security aspects within the validation scope and corresponding security
3906                     validation actions.
3907              Note: The security aspects of validation focus on the stakeholders’ protection needs, concerns, and
3908              associated stakeholder security requirements. The scope includes system elements, the entire
3909              system, or any artifact that impacts the stakeholder’s confidence in the system and the decision
3910              to accept the system as being trustworthy for its intended use.

3911              VA-1.2 Identify the constraints that can potentially limit the feasibility of the security validation
3912                     actions.
3913              Note: Constraints may include the level of assurance and the availability of business or mission
3914              stakeholders to support validation activities; the availability of sufficient, relevant, and credible
3915              threat data; the limits on conducting validation activities in actual operational conditions across all
3916              business and mission modes and associated system states and modes; technology employed; the
3917              size and complexity of the system element or artifact; and the cost and time allotted for validation
3918              activities.
3919              VA-1.3 Select appropriate security validation methods and the associated success criteria for
3920                     each security validation action.
3921              Note: Adversity emulation, including penetration testing and emulating abuse and misuse, is
3922              included.
3923              VA-1.4 Develop the security aspects of the validation strategy.
3924              Note: The security aspects of the validation strategy address the approach to incorporate security
3925              considerations into all validation actions, considering trade-offs between scope, depth, and rigor
3926              needed for the desired level of assurance and the given constraints.
3927              VA-1.5 Identify the security-relevant system constraints that result from the security aspects of
3928                     the validation strategy to be incorporated in the stakeholder protection needs and the
3929                     requirements transformed from those needs.
3930              Note: These constraints are associated with the clarity and accuracy of the expression of needs
3931              and requirements to achieve the desired level of assurance with certainty and repeatability.
3932              VA-1.6 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
3933                     validation.
3934              VA-1.7 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services to support the security aspects of
3935                     validation.
3936              VA-1.8 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be used
3937                     to support validation.

3940   VA-2       PERFORM VALIDATION
3941              VA-2.1 Define the security aspects of the validation procedures, each supporting one or a set of
3942                     validation actions.
3943              Note: This includes the identification of the validation methods or techniques to be employed, the
3944              qualifications of individuals conducting the validation, and any specialized equipment that may be
3945              needed, such as what may be required to emulate environmental adversities.
3946              VA-2.2 Perform security validation procedures.
3947              Note 1: Security-focused validation actions from the execution of validation procedures contribute
3948              to demonstrating that the system is sufficiently trustworthy.
3949              Note 2: The performance of a security-focused validation action consists of capturing a result from
3950              the execution of the procedure, comparing the obtained result with the expected result, deducing
3951              the degree of compliance of the element, and deciding about the acceptability of compliance if
3952              uncertainty remains.

3955   VA-3       MANAGE RESULTS OF VALIDATION
3956              VA-3.1 Record the security aspects of validation results and any anomalies encountered.
3957              Note: The recorded validation results include nonconformance issues, anomalies, or problems that
3958              are potentially security related. These results inform the analyses to determine causes and enable
3959              corrective or improvement actions. Corrective actions may affect the security aspects of the
3960              system architecture definition, design definition, system security requirements and associated
3961              constraints, the level of assurance that can be obtained, and/or the implementation strategy,
3962              including its security aspects.
3963              VA-3.2 Record the security characteristics of operational incidents and problems and track their
3964                     resolution.
3965              Note: Incidents that occur in the operational environment of the system are recorded and
3966              subsequently correlated to validation activities and results. This is an important feedback loop for
3967              continuous improvement in the engineering of trustworthy secure systems.
3968              VA-3.3 Obtain agreement that security validation criteria have been met.
3969              VA-3.4 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of validation.
3970              Note: Bidirectional traceability of the security aspects of validated system elements to stakeholder
3971              protection needs, security concerns, and security requirements is maintained. Traceability
3972              demonstrates completeness of the validation process and provides evidence that supports
3973              assurance and trustworthiness claims.
3974              VA-3.5 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

4013              Note 2: This includes planning for securely starting the system, halting the system, shutting down
4014              the system, operating the system in a training mode, secure implementation of work-around
4015              procedures to restore operation, performing back-out and restore operations, operating in any
4016              degraded mode, or alternative modes for special conditions. If needed, the operator performs the
4017              necessary steps to enter into contingency operations and possibly power down the system.
4018              Contingency operations are performed in accordance with pre-established procedures for such an
4019              event.
4020              Note 3: There may be a need to plan for certain modes of operation for which security functions
4021              and services are reduced or eliminated to achieve more critical system functions and services or
4022              to carry out certain maintenance or periodic testing. Predetermined procedures for entering and

4085   H.13 MAINTENANCE
4086   The purpose of the Maintenance process is to sustain the capability of the system to provide a
4087   product or service.
4088   [ISO 15288] Reprinted with permission from IEEE, Copyright IEEE 2015, All rights reserved.

4089   Security Purpose
4090   •    Establish the security aspects of requirements and constraints to securely sustain the
4091        capability of the system to provide a product or service.
4092   Note: Secure sustainment includes all maintenance and logistics activities for the packaging,
4093   handling, storage, and transportation of replacement system elements.

4094   Security Outcomes
4095   •    Security aspects of maintenance and logistics constraints that influence system requirements,
4096        architecture, or design are identified.
4097   •    Enabling systems or services needed for the security aspects of system maintenance and

4102   Security Activities and Tasks

4103   MA-1       PREPARE FOR MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS
4104              MA-1.1 Define the security aspects of the maintenance strategy.
4105              Note: The maintenance strategy seeks to preserve the secure capability and performance of the
4106              delivered system. The security aspects of the maintenance strategy generally include:
4107              -    The secure transition of the system and system elements into a secure maintenance mode or
4108                   state, as well as the secure transition back to operation.
4109              -    An approach to ensure that sourced materials and system elements that do not meet specified
4110                   quality, origin, and functionality (e.g., counterfeit) are not introduced into the system.

4111              -    The skill and personnel levels required to effect repairs, replacements, and restoration
4112                   accounting for maintenance staff requirements and any relevant legislation regarding health,
4113                   safety, security, and the environment.
4114              -    Maintenance measures that provide insight into the security aspects of performance levels,
4115                   effectiveness, and efficiency.
4116              MA-1.2 Define the security aspects of the logistics strategy.
4117              Note: The logistics strategy defines the specific security considerations required to perform
4118              logistics throughout the life cycle. This generally includes:
4119              -    Acquisition logistics to help ensure that security implications are considered early during the
4120                   development stage.
4121              -    Operations logistics to help ensure that the necessary material and resources, in the right
4122                   quantity and quality, are securely made available at the right place and time; considerations
4123                   for securely making material and resources available include identification and marking,
4124                   packaging, distribution, handling, and provisioning.
4125              -    The security criteria for storage locations and conditions, as well as the number and type of
4126                   replacement system security-specific elements, their anticipated replacement rate, and their
4127                   storage life and renewal frequency.
4128              MA-1.3 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives that result from the security
4129                     aspects of maintenance and logistics to be incorporated into the system requirements,
4130                     architecture, and design.
4131              MA-1.4 Identify trade-offs such that the security aspects of the system and associated
4132                     maintenance and logistics actions result in a solution that is trustworthy, secure,
4133                     affordable, operable, supportable, and sustainable.
4134              Note: The cost of secure maintenance and logistics should be considered within the lifetime cost
4135              of the system.
4136              MA-1.5 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems, products, and services needed to
4137                     support maintenance and logistics.
4138              MA-1.6 Identify and plan for enabling systems, products, and services needed to support the
4139                     security aspects of maintenance and logistics.
4140              MA-1.7 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems, products, and
4141                     services to be used in maintenance and logistics.

4145   MA-2       PERFORM MAINTENANCE
4146   Note: The need to perform maintenance may be driven by the need to address explicit security issues,
4147   incidents, or failures. All maintenance actions must be accomplished in a secure manner with the
4148   understanding that some actions may have a direct effect on the security posture of the system.
4149              MA-2.1 Monitor and review stakeholder requirements and incident and problem reports to
4150                     identify security-relevant corrective, preventive, adaptive, additive, or perfective
4151                     maintenance needs.
4152              Note: Security-relevant maintenance needs include those needs that are direct (e.g., an identified
4153              security incident) or indirect (e.g., considerations to securely address a maintenance need).

4212   Security Activities and Tasks

4213   DS-1       PREPARE FOR DISPOSAL
4214              DS-1.1 Define the security aspects of the disposal strategy.
4215              Note: The security aspects address securely terminating system functions and services,
4216              transforming the system and environment into an acceptable secure state, addressing security
4217              concerns, and transitioning the system and system elements for future use. The disposal strategy
4218              determines approaches, schedules, resources, specific considerations of secure disposal, and the
4219              effectiveness and completeness of secure disposal and disposition actions.
4220              -    Permanent termination of system functions and delivery of services: The security aspects
4221                   address the removal, decommissioning, or destruction of the associated system elements
4222                   while preserving the security posture of any remaining functions and services.
4223              -    Transform the system and environment into an acceptable state: The security aspects address
4224                   any alterations made to the system, its operation, and the environment to ensure that
4225                   stakeholder protection needs and concerns are addressed by the remaining portions of the
4226                   system and the functions and services it provides. When the entire system is removed, the
4227                   security aspects address alterations to the environment to return it to its original or agreed-
4228                   upon secure state.
4229              -    Address security concerns for material, data, and information: The security aspects address
4230                   protections for sensitive components, technology, data, and information removed from
4231                   service, dismantled, stored, prepared for reuse, or destroyed. The aspects may include the
4232                   duration of protection level/state, downgrades, releasability, and criteria that define

4233                   authorized access and use during the storage period. The protection needs for disposal are
4234                   defined by stakeholders and agreements and may be subject to regulatory requirements,
4235                   expectations, and constraints.
4236              -    Transition the system and system elements for future use: The security aspects address the
4237                   transition of the system or system elements for future use in a modified or adapted form,
4238                   including legacy migration and return to service. The security aspects may include constraints,
4239                   limitations, or other criteria to enable recovery of the systems’ functions and services within
4240                   a specified time or to ensure security-oriented interoperability with future enabling systems
4241                   and other systems. These aspects may also include periodic inspections to account for the
4242                   security posture and return-to-service readiness of stored system elements, associated data
4243                   and information, and all supporting operations and sustainment support materials. The
4244                   security aspects apply to all system functions and services and are not limited to only security
4245                   protection-oriented functions and services of the system.
4246              DS-1.2 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives of disposal on the system
4247                     requirements, architecture and design characteristics, and implementation techniques.
4248              DS-1.3 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support disposal.
4249              DS-1.4 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security aspects
4250                     of disposal.

4252                     in disposal.
4253              DS-1.6 Specify security criteria for containment facilities, storage locations, inspection, and
4254                     storage periods (if the system is to be stored).
4255              DS-1.7 Define the security aspects of preventive methods to preclude disposed elements and
4256                     materials that should not be repurposed, reclaimed, or reused from re-entering the
4257                     supply chain.

4479   Security Activities and Tasks
4480   DM-1       PREPARE FOR DECISIONS
4481              DM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the decision management strategy.
4482              Note: A decision management strategy includes the identification of security-relevant roles,
4483              responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. It includes the identification of security-specific
4484              decision categories and a prioritization scheme. Security-relevant decisions often arise as a result
4485              of a security effectiveness assessment, a technical trade-off, a security-relevant problem needing
4486              to be solved, an action needed as a response to security risk that exceeds the acceptable threshold,
4487              or a new opportunity.
4488              DM-1.2 Identify the security aspects of the circumstances and need for a decision.
4489              DM-1.3 Identify stakeholders with relevant security expertise to support decision-making efforts.

4492              DM-2.1 Select and declare the security aspects of the decision management strategy for each
4493                     decision.
4494              Note: This includes the security-relevant level of rigor and the data and system analysis needed.
4495              DM-2.2 Determine the desired security outcomes and the measurable security attributes of
4496                     selection criteria.
4497              Note: The desired value for all quantifiable security criteria and the threshold value(s) beyond
4498              which the attribute will be unsatisfactory are determined.
4499              DM-2.3 Identify the security aspects of the trade space and alternatives.
4500              Note: If a large number of alternatives exist, security aspects are to qualitatively screen to reduce
4501              alternatives to a manageable number for further detailed system analysis.
4502              DM-2.4 Evaluate each alternative against the security criteria.

4515   I.4 RISK MANAGEMENT
4516   The purpose of the Risk Management process is to identify, analyze, treat, and monitor the risks
4517   continually.
4518   [ISO 15288] Reprinted with permission from IEEE, Copyright IEEE 2015, All rights reserved.

4519   Security Purpose
4520   •    Continually identify, analyze, treat, and monitor the risks associated with the uncertainty of
4521        achieving security objectives and the effects of security protection efforts on achieving system
4522        objectives.

4523   Security Outcomes
4524   •    Security-relevant risks are identified.
4525   •    Security-relevant risks are analyzed.
4526   •    Security-relevant risk treatments are selected.
4527   •    Security-relevant risk treatments are implemented.
4528   •    Security-relevant risks are evaluated on an ongoing basis to assess changes in status and
4529        progress in treatment.
4530   •    Security-relevant risks are recorded and maintained in the risk profile.

4531   Security Activities and Tasks
4532   RM-1       PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
4533              RM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the risk management strategy.
4534              Note 1: The nature of security risk includes intentional and unintentional casual events,
4535              considerations of the intended behaviors and outcomes, functions (security and other functions),
4536              and the potential effects of security risk realization. Casual events may be combinations of events
4537              in the operational environment and events in the system environment.
4538              Note 2: The security aspects scope of the risk management process, risk management approach,
4539              risk criteria, measures, parameters, rating scale, and treatment alternatives are defined. This
4540              includes security aspects of the risk management process at all levels of the supply chain (e.g.,
4541              suppliers, subcontractors) and how they are incorporated into the project risk management
4542              process.
4543              Note 3: The strategy can also include those security-relevant issues (e.g., risks with likelihood of
4544              occurrence of 1) and opportunities within scope and approach. Opportunity aspects include
4545              opportunity criteria, measures, parameters, rating scale, and treatment alternatives.
4546              RM-1.2 Define and record the security context of the risk management process.
4547              Note 1: This includes the identification of security-relevant stakeholders and descriptions of their
4548              perspectives, risk categories, and technical and managerial objectives, assumptions, and
4549              constraints.
4550              Note 2: Security opportunities provide potential benefits for the system or project. Security
4551              contexts consider the security impact of not pursuing an opportunity and the security risk of not
4552              achieving the effects provided by the opportunity.

4555   RM-2       MANAGE THE RISK PROFILE
4556              RM-2.1 Define and record the security risk thresholds and conditions.
4557              Note: The security risk thresholds define the levels at which the appropriate treatment strategies
4558              are considered.
4559              RM-2.2 Establish and maintain the security aspects of the risk profile.
4560              Note: The risk profile records each security risk and opportunity including a description of the
4561              security risk or opportunity, a record of the risk or opportunity parameters, the priority based on
4562              risk or opportunity criteria, and the risk or opportunity current state, treatment, and contingency
4563              strategy. When an individual security risk or opportunity state changes, the risk profile is updated.
4564              RM-2.3 Provide the security aspects of the relevant risk profile to stakeholders.
4565              Note: Project planning determines the frequency of communicating the risk profile and its security
4566              aspects.

4569   RM-3       ANALYZE RISK
4570              RM-3.1 Identify security risks in the categories described in the risk management context.
4571              Note: Security risks are commonly identified through various security and other analyses, such as
4572              safety, assurance, producibility, and performance analyses; technology, architecture, integration,
4573              and readiness assessments; measurement reports; and trade-off studies. Additionally, security
4574              risks are often identified through the analysis of measures associated with system security goals
4575              (e.g., security-relevant Measures of Effectiveness or Measures of Performance).
4576              RM-3.2 Measure each identified security risk.
4577              Note: A common risk measurement is the likelihood of occurrence and consequences as well as
4578              the levels of confidence with those measures.
4579              RM-3.3 Evaluate each security risk against its risk thresholds.
4580              RM-3.4 Define and record recommended treatment strategies and measures for each security-
4581                     relevant risk that exceeds its risk threshold.

4585              RM-4.1 Identify recommended alternatives for security risk treatment.
4586              RM-4.2 Define measures for determining the effectiveness of security risk treatments.
4587              RM-4.3 Implement selected security risk treatments.
4588              Note: The implemented alternative should be the one for which the security-relevant stakeholders
4589              determine the actions taken will make a security-relevant risk acceptable.
4590              RM-4.4 Coordinate management action for selected security risk treatments.

4884        management and deployment of life cycle models and processes.
4885   •    Security roles, responsibility, accountability, and authority within life cycle policies, processes,
4886        models, and procedures are defined.
4887   •    The selection of policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and procedures for use by the
4888        organization is informed by security needs and considerations.
4889   •    Security needs and considerations for policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and
4890        procedures for use by the organization are assessed.
4891   •    Prioritized security-relevant process, model, and procedure improvements are implemented.

4892   Security Activities and Tasks
4893   LM-1       ESTABLISH THE LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES
4894              LM-1.1 Establish policies and procedures for process management and deployment that are
4895                     consistent with the security aspects of organizational strategies.
