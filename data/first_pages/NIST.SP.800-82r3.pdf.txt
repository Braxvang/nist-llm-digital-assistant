September 2023



Abstract
This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT) while
addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a
broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment
(or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices
detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and
events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation
systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and
physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and
typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and
provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.

Keywords
computer security; distributed control systems (DCS); industrial control systems (ICS);
information security; network security; operational technology (OT); programmable logic
controllers (PLC); risk management; security controls; supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) systems.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

Executive Summary
This document provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT) 1 while
addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a
broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment
(or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices
detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and
events. Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building automation systems,
transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring
systems, and physical environment measurement systems. This document provides an overview
of OT and typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these
systems, and recommends security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.
OT is vital to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected,
mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of
the Nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and operated. Additionally,
critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the
interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and interconnections between
business partners.
Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems because
OT systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and
software. As OT systems adopt IT solutions to enable corporate business systems connectivity
and remote access capabilities and are designed and implemented using industry-standard
computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they have begun to resemble IT
systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation
for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT
systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk
from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical
access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in
typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to
OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions that are tailored to the OT environment
are needed.
Although some characteristics are similar, OT also has characteristics that differ from traditional
information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that logic
executing in OT has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics include
significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious damage to the environment, and
severe financial issues, such as production losses, negative impacts to the Nation’s economy, and
the compromise of proprietary information. OT has unique performance and reliability
requirements and often uses OSs and applications that may be considered unconventional to
typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with
security in the design and operation of OT systems.

OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs
at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs because cybersecurity is essential
to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to OT systems can
come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled
employees, malicious intruders, complexities, natural disasters, malicious actions by insiders,
and unintentional actions such human error or failure to follow established policies and
procedures. OT security objectives typically prioritize integrity and availability, followed by
confidentiality, but also must consider safety as an overarching priority.
Possible incidents that an OT system may face include:
   •   Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT
       operation, including loss of view and loss of control
   •   Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds that could damage,
       disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human
       life
   •   Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes
       or to cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions that could have various negative
       effects
   •   Modified OT software or configuration settings or OT software infected with malware,
       which could have various negative effects
   •   Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger
       costly and difficult-to-replace equipment
   •   Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life
Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following:
   •   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems. This may
       include using unidirectional gateways, utilizing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network
       architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing directly between the
       corporate and OT networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and
       credentials for users of the corporate and OT networks. The OT system should also use a
       network topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications
       occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.
   •   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices. Unauthorized physical access
       to components can seriously disrupt the OT’s functionality. A combination of physical
       access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.
   •   Protect individual OT components from exploitation. This includes deploying security
       patches in as expeditious a manner as possible after testing them under field conditions,
       disabling all unused ports and services and ensuring that they remain disabled, restricting
       OT user privileges to only those that are required for each user’s role, tracking and
       monitoring audit trails, and using security controls such as antivirus software and file
       integrity checking software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and
       mitigate malware. Keys of OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and

       safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all times unless they are being actively
       programmed.
   •   Restrict unauthorized modification of data. This includes data in all states (e.g., at rest,
       in transit, in use) including data flows crossing network boundaries.
   •   Detect security events and incidents. Detecting security events that have not yet
       escalated into incidents can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain
       their objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed OT components, unavailable
       services, and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe
       functioning of the OT system.
   •   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the OT
       system with the ability to ensure delivery of critical operations through disruption.
       Critical components should have a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component
       fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the OT or
       other networks nor causes another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The OT
       system should also allow for graceful degradation, such as moving from “normal
       operation” with full automation to “emergency operation” with operators more involved
       and less automation to “manual operation” with no automation.
   •   Restore and recover the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable, and an
       incident response plan is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is
       how quickly the system can be recovered after an incident has occurred.
A cross-functional cybersecurity team can share their varied domain knowledge and experience
to evaluate and mitigate risks to the OT system. At a minimum, the cybersecurity team should
consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator,
a network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the
physical security department. For continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should
consult with the control system vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team
should coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s
Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who – along with the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) – accepts complete responsibility
and accountability for the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability
incidents, or equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective
cybersecurity program for an OT system should apply a strategy known as “defense in depth,”
while calls for layering security mechanisms such that the impact of a failure in any one
mechanism is minimized. Organizations should not rely on “security by obscurity.”
In a typical OT system, a defense-in-depth strategy includes:
   •   Developing security policies, procedures, training, and educational material that apply
       specifically to the OT system
   •   Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the National Terrorism
       Advisory System and deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat
       Level increases
   •   Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture
       design, procurement, installation, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning

   •   Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the
       most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer
   •   Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful
       inspection firewalls between the networks, unidirectional gateways)
   •   Considering where physical separation may be required as opposed to logical separation
   •   Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate
       and OT networks)
   •   Using multi-factor authentication for remote access to the OT system
   •   Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks
   •   Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic
       cascading events
   •   Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after testing to ensure that this will
       not impact OT operation
   •   Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices
   •   Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s
       function (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the
       principle of least privilege)
   •   Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network
       and the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user
       accounts)
   •   Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication
   •   Implementing security controls (e.g., intrusion detection software, antivirus software, file
       integrity checking software) where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and
       mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and
       from the OT system
   •   Applying security techniques, such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes, to OT data
       storage and communications where appropriate
   •   Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions
       on a test system, if possible, before installation on the OT system
   •   Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system
   •   Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible

September 2023

In cooperation with the public and private sector OT community, NIST has developed specific
guidance on the application of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53,
Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5],
to OT. This guidance is included in Appendix F of this document.
While many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 are applicable to OT as written, some
controls require OT-specific interpretation and/or augmentation by adding one or more of the
following:
   •   OT Discussion provides organizations with additional information on the application of
       the security controls and control enhancements to OT and the environments in which
       these specialized systems operate. The guidance also provides information as to why a
       particular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some OT
       environments or may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping
       guidance and/or compensating controls). OT Discussion does not replace the original
       Supplemental Guidance in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.
   •   Control Enhancements (one or more) provide augmentations to the original control that
       may be required for some OT systems.
 The most successful method for securing OT systems is to gather industry-recommended
 practices and engage in a proactive, collaborative effort between management, the OT
 engineers and operators, the IT organization, and a trusted OT advisor. This team should draw
 upon the wealth of information available from the ongoing Federal Government, industry
 group, vendor, and standards activities listed in Appendix D.

     Introduction

          Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for establishing secure operational
technology (OT) 2 while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety
requirements. This document gives an overview of OT systems and typical system topologies,
identifies common threats and vulnerabilities for these systems, and recommends security
countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. Additionally, it presents an OT-tailored security
control overlay based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5] that
customizes controls for the unique characteristics of the OT domain. The body of the document
provides context for the overlay, but the overlay is intended to stand alone.
Because there are many types of OT with varying levels of potential risk and impact, this
document provides a list of many methods and techniques for securing OT systems. The
document should not be used purely as a checklist to secure a specific system. Readers are
encouraged to perform a risk-based assessment on their systems and to tailor the recommended
guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security, business, and operational requirements.
The range of applicability of the basic concepts for securing OT systems presented in this
document continues to expand.

        OT Overview
Operational technology (OT) 3 encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices
that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical
environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring
and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems,
building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical
environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.
OT systems consist of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical,
hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing,
transportation of matter or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing
an output is referred to as the process. The part of the system primarily concerned with
maintaining conformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control). The
control components of the system include the specification of the desired output or performance.
The system can be configured in one of three ways:
        •    Open loop: The output is controlled by established settings.
        •    Closed loop: The output affects the input in such a way as to maintain the desired control
             objective.
        •    Manual mode: The system is completely controlled by humans.
This section provides an overview of several types of common OT systems, including
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distributed control systems (DCS),
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), building automation systems (BASs), physical access
control systems (PACSs), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Diagrams depict the
network topology, connections, components, and protocols that are typically used for each
system type. These examples only attempt to identify notional topology concepts. Actual
implementations of these types of control systems may be hybrids that blur the lines between
them. Note that the diagrams in this section do not focus on securing OT. Security architecture
and security controls are discussed in Section 5 and Appendix F of this document, respectively.

             Evolution of OT
Much of today’s OT evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems,
often replacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms. For example, embedded digital
controls replaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines. Improvements in
cost and performance have encouraged this evolution and resulted in many of today’s “smart”
technologies, such as the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart
manufacturing, and the Internet of Things. While this increases the connectivity and criticality of
these systems, it also creates a greater need for their adaptability, resilience, safety, and security.
Engineering OT continues to provide new capabilities while maintaining the typical long life
cycles of these systems. The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems presents
emergent behavior with security implications. Engineering models and analysis are evolving to
address these emergent properties, including safety, security, privacy, and environmental impact
interdependencies.

       OT-Based Systems and Their Interdependencies
OT is used in many industries and infrastructures, including those identified by the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as critical infrastructure sectors listed below. OT can
be found in all critical infrastructures and is more prevalent in the sectors that are in bold.
   •   Chemical Sector
   •   Commercial Facilities Sector
   •   Communications Sector
   •   Critical Manufacturing Sector
   •   Dams Sector
   •   Defense Industrial Base Sector
   •   Emergency Services Sector
   •   Energy Sector
   •   Financial Services Sector
   •   Food and Agriculture Sector
   •   Government Facilities Sector
   •   Healthcare and Public Health Sector
   •   Information Technology Sector
   •   Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector
   •   Transportation Systems Sector
   •   Water and Wastewater Systems Sector
OT is vital to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected
and mutually dependent systems, both physically and through a host of information and
communications technologies. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of
the critical infrastructures mentioned above, many others are privately owned and operated.
Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the
interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and the interconnections between
business partners [Peerenboom][Rinaldi]. An incident in one infrastructure can directly and
indirectly affect other infrastructures through cascading and escalating failures.
For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use
geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and
dynamic systems that consist of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives
for supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity
distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control
stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control water,
oil, and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships, trucks, rail systems, and wastewater
collection systems.

September 2023

SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power
control centers and generation facilities. Although electric power generation facility operation is
controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system to coordinate
production output with transmission and distribution demands.
Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of
interdependent critical infrastructures. For example, a cascading failure can be initiated by a
disruption of the microwave communications network used for an electric power transmission
SCADA system. The lack of monitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating
unit to be taken offline and lead to the loss of power at a transmission substation. This loss could
cause a major imbalance, triggering a cascading failure across the power grid and resulting in
large area blackouts that potentially affect oil and natural gas production, refinery operations,
water treatment systems, wastewater collection systems, and pipeline transport systems that rely
on the grid for electric power.

       OT System Operation, Architectures, and Components
As Fig. 1 depicts, a typical OT system contains numerous control loops, human-machine
interfaces, and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools. The system is built using an array of
network protocols on layered network architectures. Some critical processes may also include
safety systems.
A control loop utilizes sensors, actuators, and controllers to manipulate some controlled process.
A sensor is a device that produces a measurement of some physical property and then sends this
information as controlled variables to the controller. The controller interprets the measurements
and generates corresponding manipulated variables based on a control algorithm and target set
points, which it transmits to the actuators. Actuators – such as control valves, breakers, switches,
and motors – are used to directly manipulate the controlled process based on commands from the
controller.
In a typical monitoring system, there are generally no direct connections between the sensors and
any actuators. Sensor values are transmitted to a monitoring station to be analyzed by a human.
However, these types of systems can still be considered OT systems (albeit with a human in the
loop) because the objective of the monitoring system is likely to identify and ultimately mitigate
an event or condition (e.g., a door alerting that it has been forced open, resulting in security
personnel being sent to investigate; an environmental sensor that detects high temperatures in a
server room, resulting in control center personnel activating an auxiliary air conditioning unit).
Operators and engineers use human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to monitor and configure set
points, control algorithms, and adjust and establish parameters in the controller. The HMI also
displays process status information and historical information. Diagnostics and maintenance
utilities are used to prevent, identify, and recover from abnormal operation or failures.
Sometimes, control loops are nested and/or cascading, whereby the set point for one loop is
based on the process variable determined by another loop. Supervisory-level loops and lower-
level loops operate continuously over the duration of a process with cycle times ranging in the
order of milliseconds to minutes.

2.3.1. OT System Design Considerations
The design of an OT system depends on many factors, including whether a SCADA, DCS, or
PLC-based topology is used. This section identifies key factors that drive design decisions
regarding the control, communication, reliability, and redundancy properties of the OT system.
Because these factors heavily influence the design of the OT system, they also help determine
the system’s security needs.
   •   Safety. Systems must be able to detect unsafe conditions and trigger actions to reduce
       unsafe conditions to safe ones. In most safety-critical operations, human oversight and
       control of a potentially dangerous process are essential.
   •   Control timing requirements. System processes have a wide range of time-related
       requirements, including very high speed, consistency, regularity, and synchronization.
       Humans may be unable to reliably and consistently meet these requirements, so
       automated controllers may be necessary. Some systems may require computation to be
       performed as close to sensors and actuators as possible to reduce communication latency
       and perform necessary control actions on time.
   •   Geographic distribution. Systems have varying degrees of distribution, ranging from a
       small system (e.g., local PLC-controlled process) to large, distributed systems (e.g., oil
       pipelines, electric power grids). Greater distribution typically implies a need for wide
       area networking (e.g., leased lines, circuit switching, packet switching) and mobile
       communication.


                                                11

September 2023

   •   Hierarchy. Supervisory control is used to provide a central location that can aggregate
       data from multiple locations to support control decisions based on the current state of the
       system. A hierarchical or centralized control is often used to provide human operators
       with a comprehensive view of the entire system.
   •   Control complexity. Simple controllers and preset algorithms can often perform control
       functions. However, more complex systems (e.g., air traffic control) require human
       operators to ensure that all control actions are appropriate for meeting the larger
       objectives of the system.
   •   Availability. Systems with strong availability and up-time requirements may require
       more redundancy or alternate implementations across all communications and controls.
   •   Impact of failures. The failure of a control function could cause substantially different
       impacts across domains. Systems with greater impacts often require the ability to
       continue operations through redundant controls or to operate in a degraded state.

2.3.2. SCADA Systems
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control dispersed assets
for which centralized data acquisition is as important as control [Bailey][Boyer]. These systems
are used in distribution systems, such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems, oil
and natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems, and rail and
other public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with data
transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system
for numerous process inputs and outputs. SCADA systems are designed to collect field
information, transfer it to a control center, and display the information to the operator graphically
or textually, thereby allowing the operator to monitor or control an entire system from a central
location in near real-time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control
of any individual system, operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be performed by operator
commands.
Typical hardware includes a control server placed at a control center, communications equipment
(e.g., radio, telephone line, cable, or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed field
sites that consist of remote terminal units (RTUs) and/or PLCs that control actuators and/or
monitor sensors. The control server stores and processes the information from RTU inputs and
outputs, while the RTU or PLC controls the local process. The communications hardware allows
for the transfer of information and data between the control server and the RTUs or PLCs. The
software is programmed to tell the system what and when to monitor, what parameter ranges are
acceptable, and what response to initiate when a process variable changes outside of acceptable
values. An intelligent electronic device (IED), such as a protective relay, may communicate
directly to the control server, or a local RTU may poll the IEDs to collect the data and pass it to
the control server. IEDs provide a direct interface to control and monitor equipment and sensors.
IEDs may be directly polled and controlled by the control server and, in most cases, have local
programming that allows for the IED to act without direct instructions from the control center.
SCADA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant systems with significant redundancy
built in, although redundancy may not be a sufficient countermeasure in the face of a malicious
attack.

Figure 2 shows the components and general configuration of a SCADA system. The control
center at the top of the diagram houses a control server and the communications routers. Other
control center components include the HMI, engineering workstations, and the data historian,
which are all connected by a local area network (LAN). The control center collects and logs
information gathered by the field sites, displays information to the HMI, and may generate
actions based on detected events. The control center is also responsible for centralized alarming,
trend analyses, and reporting.
The field sites at the bottom of Fig. 2 locally control actuators and monitor sensors. Field sites
are often equipped with a remote access capability to allow operators to perform remote
diagnostics and repairs, usually over a separate dial-up modem or wide area network (WAN)
connection. Standard and proprietary communication protocols that run over serial and network
communications are used to transport information between the control center and field sites
using telemetry techniques, such as telephone line, cable, fiber, and radio frequencies (e.g.,
broadcast, microwave, satellite).

SCADA communication topologies vary among implementations. The various topologies used
are shown in Fig. 3, including point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop [AGA12]. Point-
to-point is functionally the simplest type, though it can be expensive because of the individual
channels needed for each connection. In a series configuration, the number of channels used is
reduced, though channel sharing impacts the efficiency and complexity of SCADA operations.
Similarly, the series-star and multi-drop configurations’ use of one channel per device results in
decreased efficiency and increased system complexity.
The four basic SCADA topologies shown in Fig. 3 can be further augmented by using dedicated
devices to manage communication exchanges and perform message switching and buffering.

Large SCADA systems that contain hundreds of RTUs often employ a sub-control server to
alleviate the burden on the primary server. This type of topology is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 5 shows an example SCADA system implementation that consists of a primary control
center and three field sites. A second backup control center provides redundancy in the event of a
primary control center malfunction. Point-to-point connections are used for all communications
between the control center and field site, and two connections use radio telemetry. The third field
site is local to the control center and uses the WAN for communications. A regional control
center resides above the primary control center for a higher level of supervisory control. The
corporate enterprise network has access to all control centers through the WAN, and field sites
can be accessed remotely for troubleshooting and maintenance operations. The primary control
center polls field devices for data at defined intervals (e.g., 5 seconds, 60 seconds) and can send
new set points to field devices as required. In addition to polling and issuing high-level
commands, the control server also watches for priority interrupts from field site alarm systems.

Figure 6 shows an example implementation for rail monitoring and control. This example
includes a rail control center that houses the SCADA system and three sections of a rail system.
The SCADA system polls the rail sections for information, such as the status of the trains, signal
systems, traction electrification systems, and ticket vending machines. This information is also
fed to operator consoles at the HMI stations within the rail control center. The SCADA system
monitors operator inputs at the rail control center and disperses high-level operator commands to
the rail section components. In addition, the SCADA system monitors conditions at the
individual rail sections and issues commands based on these conditions (e.g., stopping a train to
prevent it from entering an area that has been flooded or is occupied by another train).

2.3.3. Distributed Control Systems
A distributed control system (DCS) is used to control production systems within the same
geographic location for industries such as oil refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric
power generation, chemical manufacturing, automotive production, and pharmaceutical
processing. These systems are usually process control or discrete part control systems.
A DCS is integrated as a control architecture that contains a supervisory level of control to
oversee multiple integrated sub-systems that are responsible for controlling the details of a
localized process. A DCS uses a centralized supervisory control loop to mediate a group of
localized controllers that share the overall tasks of carrying out an entire production process
[Erickson]. Product and process control are usually achieved by deploying feedback or
feedforward control loops, whereby key product and/or process conditions are automatically
maintained around a desired set point. Specific process controllers or more capable PLCs are
employed in the field and tuned to provide the desired tolerance and the rate of self-correction
during process upsets. By modularizing the production system, a DCS reduces the impact of a
single fault on the overall system. In many modern systems, the DCS is interfaced with the
corporate enterprise network to give business operations a view of production.
Figure 7 shows an example implementation of the components and general configuration of a
DCS. This DCS encompasses an entire facility, from the bottom-level production processes up to
the corporate enterprise layer. In this example, a supervisory controller (control server)
communicates to its subordinates via a control network. The supervisor sends set points to and
requests data from the distributed field controllers. The distributed controllers control their
process actuators based on control server commands and sensor feedback from process sensors.
Figure 7 also gives examples of low-level controllers found on a DCS system. The field control
devices shown include a machine controller, a PLC, and a process controller. The machine
controller interfaces with sensors and actuators using point-to-point wiring, while the other three
field devices incorporate fieldbus networks to interface with process sensors and actuators.
Fieldbus networks eliminate the need for point-to-point wiring between a controller and
individual field sensors and actuators. Additionally, a fieldbus allows for greater functionality
beyond control, including field device diagnostics, and can accomplish control algorithms within
the fieldbus, thereby avoiding signal routing back to the PLC for every control operation.
Standard industrial communication protocols designed by industry groups such as Modbus and
Fieldbus [Berge] are often used on control networks and fieldbus networks.
In addition to the supervisory-level and field-level control loops, intermediate levels of control
may also exist. For example, in the case of a DCS controlling a discrete part manufacturing
facility, there could be an intermediate level supervisor for each cell within the plant. This
supervisor encompasses a manufacturing cell containing a machine controller that processes a
part and a robot controller that handles raw stock and final products. There could be several of
these cells that manage field-level controllers under the main DCS supervisory control loop.

2.3.4. Programmable Logic Controller-Based Topologies
PLCs are used in both SCADA and DCS systems as the control components of an overall
hierarchical system to locally manage processes through feedback control, as described in the
previous sections. In the case of SCADA systems, they may provide similar functionality to
RTUs. When used in DCS systems, PLCs are implemented as local controllers within a
supervisory control scheme.
PLCs can also be implemented as the primary controller in smaller OT system configurations to
provide operational control of discrete processes (e.g., automobile assembly lines, process
controllers). These topologies differ from SCADA and DCS in that they generally lack a central
control server or HMI and, therefore, primarily provide closed-loop control with minimal human
involvement. PLCs have a user-programmable memory for storing instructions for the purpose of
implementing specific functions, such as I/O control, logic, timing, counting, three mode
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, communications, arithmetic, and data and file
processing.
Figure 8 shows a PLC over a fieldbus network performing the control of a manufacturing
process. The PLC is accessible via a programming interface located on an engineering
workstation, and data is stored in a data historian, all of which are connected on a LAN.

2.3.5. Building Automation Systems
A building automation system (BAS) is a type of OT used to control the many systems used in a
building, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); fire; electrical; lighting;
physical access control; physical security; and other utility systems. Most modern buildings
contain some form of a BAS when they are constructed. However, older buildings and
equipment may have to be retrofitted to take advantage of the benefits that a BAS provides.
Some of the most common functions of a BAS include maintaining environmental conditions for
occupant comfort, reducing energy consumption, reducing operating and maintenance costs,
increasing security, recording historical data (e.g., temperature, humidity), and performing
general equipment monitoring (e.g., provide alerts to building personnel of device failure or an
alarm condition).
An example of a BAS is shown in Fig. 9. A BAS may communicate over wired or wireless paths
to controllers or gateways. For example, environmental control sensors can provide the
temperature and humidity to a building controller. If the sensor values are outside of the set
points, the controller can signal a variable air volume (VAV) box to increase or decrease airflow
and bring the temperature to the desired state. Similarly, a building occupant scanning their
identification badge at a badge reader can result in the credentials being sent to the access control
controller and application control server to determine whether access should be granted.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect a BAS against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.

2.3.6. Physical Access Control Systems
A physical access control system (PACS) is a type of physical security system designed to
control access to an area. Unlike standard physical barriers, physical access control can control
who is granted access, when the access is granted, and how long the access should last.
An access point is the entrance or barrier where access control is required. Some common
physical access control examples of access points are doors and locks, security gates, turnstiles,
and vehicular gate arms. Depending on the type of facility, there can be a single access point
(e.g., for high-security areas) or many (e.g., for a large office building).
An identification (ID) or personal credential is used to identify the authorized user trying to gain
access to the area or facility. A PACS often requires a user to have credentials to gain entrance to
a facility or access sensitive data. Examples of identification credentials include simple controls
(e.g., PIN codes, passwords, key fobs, key cards) and more advanced credentials (e.g., encrypted
badges, mobile credentials). Identification credentials allow the system to know who is
attempting to gain access and to maintain access logs.
Readers and/or keypads are typically located at the access point. The reader reads the data and
sends it to a door controller to validate the credential and determine whether access should be
authorized. If a keypad or biometric reader is also required (i.e., for multi-factor authentication),
the user will enter their PIN or perform the biometric scan following their credential scan. An
example of a PACS is shown in Fig. 10.




                              Fig. 10. A PACS implementation example

In this example, the door controller receives credential data from the reader and verifies the
identification credential. If the credential is approved by the access control server, the control
panel transmits the command to authorize access and unlock the door. If the credential is denied,
the door will remain locked, and the user will not be able to gain entry. All access attempts are
logged by the door controller(s) and, ultimately, the access control server. The access control

server is the repository for user information, access privileges, and audit logs. Depending on the
system, the server might be on-premises or managed in the cloud.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect a PACS against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.

2.3.7. Safety Systems
Many of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous
situations to human life and safety, property, and the environment. Safety systems are designed
to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of these potentially hazardous situations by bringing
the system to a safe state. There are several types of safety systems related to OT environments,
including emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems
(FGS).
One of the more well-known types of safety system is the safety instrumented system (SIS),
which is composed of one or more safety instrumented functions (SIFs). An SIF is an engineered
system that is typically comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements (e.g.,
actuators) whose purpose is to bring a system to a safe state when predetermined thresholds are
violated. An SIS is implemented as part of an overall risk reduction strategy to reduce the
likelihood and/or potential consequences of a previously identified event so that it is within the
organization’s risk tolerance. Although numerous other terms are associated with safety systems,
the SIS is specifically designed in accordance with [IEC61511]. An SIS is typically found in
chemical, refinery, and nuclear processes.
An SIS is often independent from all other control systems in such a manner that a failure of the
basic process control system (BPCS) will not impact SIS functionality in a deleterious manner.
Historically, an SIS was designed to be stand-alone, physically and logically separated, and air-
gapped from the rest of the control system. In the configuration shown in Fig. 11, the SIS and
BPCS operate completely independent of each other with no direct communication between the
systems. However, some modern SISs have been designed to allow communication with the
control system. These types of SISs are called Integrated Control and Safety Systems (ICSSs).
An ICSS solution may be an all-in-one device from a single vendor or incorporate multiple
devices from multiple vendors. While an ICSS combines the functionality of both control and
safety systems, the SIS must still comply with the requirements outlined in [IEC61511]. One of
the advantages to this ICSS methodology is the ability to communicate information from the SIS
to the BPCS.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect safety systems against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-
based assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet
their specific security, business, and operational requirements.

2.3.8. Industrial Internet of Things
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of sensors, instruments, machines, and other
devices that are networked together and use internet connectivity to enhance industrial and
manufacturing business processes and applications [Berge]. As IT and OT systems continue to
converge and become even more interconnected, the control of physical processes remains a
relatively unique and critical concept of OT.
The Industry IoT Consortium proposes a three-tier system architecture model for representing
IIoT systems [IIRA19]: the edge tier, platform tier, and enterprise tier. Each tier plays a specific
role in processing the data flows and control flows involved in usage activities. The tiers are
connected by three networks: the proximity network, access network, and service network. An
example architecture is shown in Fig. 12.
The enterprise tier implements domain-specific applications and decision support systems,
provides interfaces to end users, receives data flows from the other tiers, and issues control
commands to the other tiers.
The platform tier receives, processes, and forwards control commands from the enterprise tier to
the edge tier. It consolidates processes and analyzes data flows from the other tiers, provides
management functions for devices and assets, and offers non-domain-specific services, such as
data query and analytics. Based on the specific implementation, these functions can be
implemented on the IIoT platform that is deployed in an on-site data center, an off-site data
center, or in the cloud.
The service network enables connectivity between the services in the platform tier, the enterprise
tier, and the services within each tier. This connectivity may be an overlay private network over


                                                 26
NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

the public internet or the internet itself, allowing enterprise-grade security between end users and
services.
The edge tier collects data from the edge nodes using the proximity network. The architectural
characteristics of this tier vary depending on the specific implementation (e.g., geographical
distribution, physical location, governance scope). It is a logical layer rather than a true physical
division. From a business perspective, the location of the edge depends on the business
objectives.




                            Fig. 12. A three-tiered IIoT system architecture

Edge computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which computing resources and
application services can be distributed along the communication path between the data source
and the cloud. It exists vertically within the full stack (i.e., from the device to the cloud) and
horizontally across IIoT subsystems. The edge is not merely a way to collect data for
transmission to the datacenter or cloud; it also processes, analyzes, and acts on data collected at
the edge and is, therefore, essential for optimizing industrial data at every aspect of an operation.




                                                  27

September 2023

The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and
communication paradigms, including:
   •   Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)
   •   Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)
   •   Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between
   •   Distributed data management that defines where and what data is to be stored and for
       how long
   •   Data governance, including quality, discovery, usability, privacy, and security
The proximity network connects edge nodes (e.g., sensors, actuators, devices, OT systems and
assets) to the stack. It typically connects these edge nodes as one or more clusters to a gateway
that bridges to other networks. The access network enables connectivity for data and control flow
between the edge and platform tiers. This connection may be a corporate network or an overlay
private network over the public internet or a 4G/5G network.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect IIoT against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.

       Comparing OT and IT System Security
OT has many characteristics that differ from traditional IT systems, including different risks and
priorities. Some of these include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious
damage to the environment, and financial issues, such as production losses. OT has different
performance and reliability requirements and uses OSs and applications that may be considered
unconventional in a typical IT network environment. Security protections must be implemented
in a way that maintains system integrity during normal operations as well as during cyber attacks
[Knapp].
Initially, OT systems had little resemblance to IT systems because they were isolated and ran
proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software. Widely available and
low-cost Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), and wireless devices are now replacing older
proprietary technologies, which increases the likelihood of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
incidents. OT are increasingly resembling IT systems as they adopt IT technologies to promote
corporate connectivity and remote access capabilities (e.g., using industry standard computers,
OSs, and network protocols). This integration supports new IT capabilities but provides
significantly less isolation for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a
greater need to secure them. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these
issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same
solutions to OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored
to the OT environment.




                                                28
NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Some special considerations when securing OT include:
   •   Timeliness and performance requirements. OT systems are generally time-critical,
       with the criterion for acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual
       installation. Some systems require reliable, deterministic responses. High throughput is
       typically not essential to OT. In contrast, IT systems typically require high throughput
       and can withstand some level of delay and jitter. For some OT, automated response times
       or system responses to human interaction is critical. Many OT systems utilize real-time
       OSs (RTOS), where real-time refers to timeliness requirements. The units of real time are
       highly application-dependent and must be explicitly stated.
   •   Availability requirements. Many OT processes are continuous in nature. Unexpected
       outages of systems that control industrial processes are unacceptable. Outages must often
       be planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance. Exhaustive pre-deployment testing
       is essential to ensuring high availability (i.e., reliability) for the OT. OT systems often
       cannot be stopped and started without affecting production. In some cases, the products
       produced or equipment being used are more important than the information being
       relayed. Therefore, typical IT strategies (e.g., rebooting a component) are usually not
       acceptable for OT due to adverse impacts on the requirements for high availability,
       reliability, and maintainability. Some OT employ redundant components – often running
       in parallel – to provide continuity when primary components are unavailable.
   •   Risk management requirements. In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data
       confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include safety, fault tolerance to
       prevent the loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory
       compliance, loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products.
       The personnel responsible for operating, securing, and maintaining OT must understand
       the important link between safety and security. Any security measure that impairs safety
       is unacceptable.
   •   Physical effects. Field devices (e.g., PLCs, operator stations, DCS controllers) are
       directly responsible for controlling physical processes. OT can have complex interactions
       with physical processes and consequences in the OT domain that can manifest in physical
       events. Understanding these potential physical effects often requires communication
       between experts in OT and experts in the particular physical domain.
   •   System operation. OT OSs and control networks are often quite different from their IT
       counterparts and require different skill sets, experience, and levels of expertise. Control
       networks are typically managed by control engineers rather than IT personnel. Assuming
       that differences are insignificant can have disastrous consequences on system operations.
   •   Resource constraints. OT and their real-time operating systems (RTOSs) are often
       resource-constrained systems that do not include typical contemporary IT security
       capabilities. Legacy systems often lack resources that are common on modern IT
       systems. Many systems may also lack desired features, including encryption capabilities,
       error logging, and password protection. Indiscriminate use of IT security practices in OT
       may cause availability and timing disruptions. There may not be computing resources
       available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current security capabilities.
       Adding resources or features may not be possible.

September 2023

   •   Communications. Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for
       field device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT
       environments and may be proprietary.
   •   Change management. Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of
       both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest
       vulnerabilities to a system. Software updates on IT systems, including security patches,
       are typically applied in a timely fashion based on appropriate security policies and
       procedures. In addition, these procedures are often automated using server-based tools.
       Software updates on OT cannot always be implemented on a timely basis. These updates
       need to be thoroughly tested by both the vendor and the end user of the industrial control
       application before being implemented. Additionally, the OT owner must plan and
       schedule OT outages days or weeks in advance. The OT may also require revalidation as
       part of the update process. Another issue is that many OT utilize older versions of OSs
       that are no longer supported by the vendor through patches. Change management is also
       applicable to hardware and firmware. The change management process requires careful
       assessment by OT experts (e.g., control engineers) working in conjunction with security
       and IT personnel.
   •   Managed support. Typical IT systems allow for diversified support styles, perhaps
       supporting disparate but interconnected technology architectures. For OT, service support
       is sometimes only available from a single vendor. In some instances, third-party security
       solutions are not allowed due to OT vendor licensing and service agreements, and service
       support can be lost if third-party applications are installed without vendor
       acknowledgement or approval.
   •   Component lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime on the order of three to five
       years due to the quick evolution of technology. For OT, where technology has been
       developed in many cases for specific uses and implementations, the lifetime of the
       deployed technology is often in the order of 10 to 15 years and sometimes longer.
   •   Component location. Most IT components and some OT components are located in
       business and commercial facilities that are physically accessible by local transportation.
       Remote locations may be utilized for backup facilities. Distributed OT components may
       be isolated, remote, and require extensive transportation effort to reach. The component
       location also needs to consider necessary physical and environmental security measures.

In summary, the operational and risk differences between IT and OT systems create the need for
increased sophistication in applying cybersecurity and operational strategies. A cross-functional
team of control engineers, control system operators, and IT security professionals must work
closely to understand the possible implications of the installation, operation, and maintenance of
security solutions in conjunction with control system operation. IT professionals working with
OT need to understand the reliability impacts of information security technologies before
deployment. Moreover, some of the OSs and applications that run on OT may not operate
correctly with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IT cybersecurity solutions because of their
unique requirements.

   OT Cybersecurity Program Development
To mitigate cybersecurity risks to their OT systems, organizations need to develop and deploy an
OT cybersecurity program. It should be consistent and integrated with existing IT cybersecurity
programs and practices but also account for the specific requirements and characteristics of OT
systems and environments. Organizations should regularly review and update their OT
cybersecurity plans and programs to reflect changes in technologies, operations, standards,
regulations, and the security needs of specific facilities.
Effective integration of cybersecurity into the operation of OT requires defining and executing a
comprehensive program that addresses all aspects of cybersecurity. This includes defining the
objectives and scope of the program; establishing a cross-functional team that understands OT
and cybersecurity; establishing policies and procedures; identifying cyber risk management
capabilities that include people, processes, and technologies; and identifying day-to-day
operations of event monitoring and auditing for compliance and improvement.
When a new system is being designed and installed, it is imperative to take the time to address
security throughout the life cycle, including architecture, procurement, installation, maintenance,
and decommissioning. Deploying systems to the field based on the assumption that these systems
will be secured later introduces significant risks to the systems and the organization. If there are
not enough time and resources to properly secure the system before deployment, it is unlikely
that security will be addressed at a later time. Since new OT systems are designed and deployed
less frequently than IT systems, it is much more common to improve, expand, or update an
existing OT system than to design a new one.
This section introduces the basic process for developing an OT cybersecurity program and
applies to new and deployed OT systems. Additional guidance for developing the specific
elements of an OT cybersecurity program can be found in Section 3.3.10.

       Establish a Charter for the OT Cybersecurity Program
Senior management must demonstrate a clear commitment to cybersecurity and communicate its
importance throughout the organization. Cybersecurity is a business responsibility shared by all
members of the organization, especially by its leaders and IT and OT teams. Commitment to
cybersecurity can be demonstrated by establishing a charter for a cybersecurity program with
adequate funding, visibility, governance, and support from senior leaders. A cybersecurity
program that has commitment from senior management is more likely to achieve the mission and
business goals of the organization.
A charter for a cybersecurity program is a plain-language high-level description that establishes
clear ownership and accountability for protecting OT resources and provides a mandate for the
most senior person responsible to establish and maintain the cybersecurity program (e.g., CISO).
This section focuses on an OT-specific program, which should be integrated with the
organization’s overall cybersecurity program.
A cybersecurity program charter should include program objectives, scope, and responsibilities.
Senior management establishes the OT cybersecurity program charter and identifies an OT
cybersecurity manager with appropriate authority to lead the OT cybersecurity program. The OT
cybersecurity manager should define the roles and responsibilities of system owners, mission and
business process managers, and users. The OT cybersecurity manager should also document the


                                                33
NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

objectives and scope of the OT security program, including the business organizations affected,
the systems and networks involved, the budget and resources required, and the division of
responsibilities.
The organization may already have an information security program in place or have developed
one for its IT systems. The OT cybersecurity manager should identify which existing practices to
leverage and which practices are specific to the OT system. Ultimately, it will be more effective
for the team to share resources with others in the organization that have similar objectives.

       Business Case for the OT Cybersecurity Program
The cybersecurity of OT systems is a critical component in the overall security of the
organization. Cybersecurity events could potentially impact the organization’s mission and
objectives, the environment, regulatory compliance, and even human safety. OT systems can also
be used as an entry point to organizational IT systems and other enterprise systems. As OT
systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures (e.g.,
air gaps) is not enough to protect such systems from cyber attacks. Therefore, security measures
tailored to the OT system are required to protect the organization. An OT cybersecurity program
considers the characteristics of OT systems that require special consideration in order to mitigate
these risks.

3.2.1. Benefits of Cybersecurity Investments
OT cybersecurity supports the mission and business functions of the organization and provides
additional benefits, including:
   •   Improving OT system safety, reliability, and availability
   •   Improving OT system efficiency
   •   Reducing community concerns
   •   Reducing legal liabilities
   •   Meeting regulatory requirements
   •   Helping with insurance coverage and costs
A strong OT cybersecurity program is fundamental to a sustainable business operation and can
potentially enhance system reliability and availability. This includes minimizing unintentional
OT system information security impacts from inappropriate testing, policies, and misconfigured
systems. Cyber attacks can also have other significant impacts, such as:
   •   Physical impacts. Physical impacts encompass the set of direct consequences of OT
       failure, particularly personal injury and the loss of life. Other effects include the loss of
       property (including data) and potential damage to the environment.
   •   Economic impacts. Economic impacts are a second-order effect of physical impacts that
       ensue from an OT incident, which in turn inflict a greater economic loss on the facility,
       organization, or others who are dependent on the OT systems. The unavailability of
       critical infrastructure (e.g., electrical power, transportation) can have economic impacts



                                                 34
NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

       far beyond the systems that sustain direct and physical damage. These effects could
       negatively impact the local, regional, national, or possibly global economy.
   •   Social impacts. Another second-order effect is the loss of national or public confidence
       in an organization.
Additional examples of the potential consequences of an OT incident are listed below. Note that
items in this list are not independent. For example, the release of hazardous material could lead
to injury or death.
   •   Impact on national security (e.g., facilitate an act of terrorism)
   •   Reduction or loss of production at one site or multiple sites simultaneously
   •   Injury or death of employees
   •   Injury or death of persons in the community
   •   Damage to equipment
   •   Release, diversion, or theft of hazardous materials
   •   Environmental damage
   •   Violation of regulatory requirements
   •   Product contamination
   •   Criminal or civil legal liabilities
   •   Loss of proprietary or confidential information
   •   Loss of brand image or customer confidence
Safety and security incidents can have negative impacts that last longer than other types of
incidents on all stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, customers, and the
communities in which an organization operates. Senior management should identify and evaluate
the highest priority items to estimate the annual business impact (e.g., in financial terms).

3.2.2. Building an OT Cybersecurity Business Case
A well-defined business case for an OT cybersecurity program is essential for management buy-
in to ensure the long-term commitment of the organization and the allocation of resources needed
for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the program. The first step in
developing an OT security program is to identify the organization’s business objectives and
missions, as well as how the cybersecurity program can lower risk and protect the organization’s
ability to perform those objectives and missions. The business case should capture the business
concerns of senior management and provide the business impact and financial justification for
creating an integrated organizational cybersecurity program. It should include detailed
information about the following:
   •   Benefits of creating an integrated security program
   •   Potential costs and failure scenarios if an OT cybersecurity program is not implemented



                                                 35

September 2023

   •   High-level overview of the process required to implement, operate, monitor, review,
       maintain, and improve the information security program
The costs and resources required to develop, implement, and maintain the security program
should be considered. The economic benefits of the cybersecurity program may be evaluated in
the same way that worker health and safety programs are. However, an attack on the OT system
could have significant consequences that far exceed monetary costs.

3.2.3. Resources for Building a Business Case
Helpful resources can be found through information sharing exchanges, trade and standards
organizations, consulting firms, and internal risk management programs or engineering and
operations. External organizations can also provide useful tips as to what factors most strongly
influenced management to support their efforts and what resources within their organizations
proved most helpful. While these factors may vary across industries, there may be similarities in
the roles that other risk management specialists can play. Appendix D lists some current
activities in OT security.
Internal resources in related risk management efforts (e.g., information security, health, safety
and environmental risk, physical security, business continuity) can provide tremendous
assistance in prioritizing threats and estimating business impacts. These resources can also
provide insight into which managers are focused on dealing with which risks and who may be
the most appropriate or receptive to serving as a champion.

3.2.4. Presenting the OT Cybersecurity Business Case to Leadership
In order to be successful, the OT cybersecurity program must have active participation from
senior management. Organization-level management in both IT and OT operations has the
perspective to understand the risks as well as the authority to assume responsibility for them.
Senior management will be responsible for approving and driving information security policies,
assigning security roles and responsibilities, and implementing the information security program
across the organization. Funding for the entire program can usually be done in phases. While
some funding may be required to start the program, additional funding can be obtained later as
the security vulnerabilities and needs of the program are better understood and additional
strategies are developed. Additionally, costs should be considered for retrofitting the OT for
security versus addressing security to begin with.
Often, a good approach to obtaining management buy-in is to base the business case on a
successful example of another organization that had a similar problem and how they solved it.
This will often prompt management to ask how that solution might be applicable to their
organization.
When presenting the business case to leadership, it may also be helpful to mention the specific
challenges in securing the OT systems:
   •   OT systems operate under different environments and requirements than IT systems. For
       example, OT systems tend to prioritize availability and safety over other factors like
       confidentiality.



                                                 36

September 2023

   •   IT programs or tools may not be suitable or effective for OT systems.
   •   Compensatory measures may be an effective solution to securing an OT system without
       affecting system performance.
   •   Protecting OT systems is critical, and a cybersecurity incident on an OT system may have
       catastrophic consequences that affect human life and the environment.

       OT Cybersecurity Program Content
This section provides recommendations for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and
continually improving an OT cybersecurity program. These recommendations are independent,
which allows the organization to select the approaches and technologies that are most suitable to
its needs.
An OT cybersecurity program is typically tailored to a specific OT environment. An organization
may have multiple sites, each with multiple specific OT environments. In such situations, an
organizational-level OT security program should be defined with recommendations that cascade
down and adapt to the needs of individual sites and OT environments.
The effectiveness of an OT cybersecurity program is often enhanced through coordination or
integration with the organization’s processes and information security program. However,
information security programs typically focus on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability –
in that order – of information for the entire organization. Information security programs do not
necessarily address all of the specific security and operational needs of an OT environment,
which instead prioritizes safety, followed by availability, integrity, and confidentiality. This
difference in focus and priorities between IT and OT security programs should be kept in mind.
NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers [SP800-100],
provides a broad overview of information security program elements to assist in establishing and
implementing an information security program in an organization.
The lifespan of an OT system can exceed 20 years. As a result, many legacy systems may
contain hardware and software that are no longer supported by vendors and cannot be patched or
updated to protect against new vulnerabilities. In that case, the security program should be
tailored to the unique characteristics of the legacy system to determine whether the controls are
applicable. When security controls are not supported by the legacy OT system, compensating
controls should be considered. For example, anti-malware software may not be available for
systems such as PLCs and DCS, which means that malware protection requirements cannot be
applied to these endpoints. In this case, a compensating control should be considered, such as
using a firewall with a deep packet inspection capability that can monitor and block advanced
threats like malware.
The primary purpose of investing in a cybersecurity program is risk management. Risk to
operations exists because of the potential of threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in the
applications and infrastructures. Therefore, the most appropriate decision regarding what to
include in the scope of a cybersecurity program can be made if investments are viewed through
the lens of corporate risk management. To help design and drive a cybersecurity program with a
risk management perspective, NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2] describes the Risk
Management Framework, which defines the core tasks and processes for implementing a



                                                37

cybersecurity program. This is briefly summarized in Section 3.3.6 and further elaborated in
Section 4.
The OT cybersecurity program should also address policy exceptions and deviations. In a
demanding OT environment, situations may arise that require a temporary deviation from the
security policy in order to maintain the mission or goal of the OT system. Such deviations or
exceptions must be handled with great care and receive approval from management and the
cross-functional team. The security program can establish a policy and procedure for handling
these policy exceptions. All of these guidance documents recognize that one size does not fit all.
Rather, domain knowledge combined with site-specific constraints should be applied in adapting
this guidance to a specific organization.

3.3.1. Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance
OT governance should include the policies, procedures, and processes for managing the
organization’s regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements. The
governance should ensure that the policies, procedures, and processes are well understood by
staff and inform the management of OT cybersecurity risk. To establish an effective OT
cybersecurity governance capability, develop a process and assign responsibilities and
accountability to appropriate roles in the corporate risk management function. Typically, a
cybersecurity governance process should include the following:
   •   Ensure that the OT cybersecurity policy is established and communicated.
   •   Ensure that OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are coordinated and aligned with
       internal roles and external partners.
   •   Ensure that legal and regulatory requirements regarding OT cybersecurity, including
       privacy, are understood and managed.
   •   Ensure that cybersecurity risks are integrated into corporate risk management processes.
Further guidance for establishing OT cybersecurity guidance can be found in Section 6.
Additional information with specific examples for establishing a cybersecurity governance
capability are also provided in NIST Internal or Interagency Report (NIST IR) 8183A,
Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations
Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.2. Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement the OT
       Cybersecurity Program
It is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity team to share their varied domain knowledge
and experience to evaluate and manage risk in OT. The OT cybersecurity team should consist of
representatives from the following departments: IT staff, control engineer, control system
operator, security subject-matter expert, and enterprise risk management. For completeness, the
information security team should also include any cybersecurity service providers.
From a safety perspective, major accident hazards and the loss of containment due to equipment
failure or operator mistakes can have serious consequences. Cybersecurity is another threat to the

cybersecurity team will be beneficial in identifying potential impact areas due to cyber
vulnerabilities. Their insight into OT design and safety considerations will also help in
formulating cyber mitigations.
While the control engineers will play a large role in securing OT, they will not be able to do so
without collaboration and support from both the IT department and management. IT often has
years of cybersecurity experience, much of which is applicable to OT. As the cultures of control
engineering and IT are often significantly different, their integration will be essential for the
development of a collaborative security design and operation.
Organizations come in various sizes, structures, geographical spreads, and complexities. These
factors and the strategies related to resources and budget constraints may drive organizations to
hire OT cybersecurity resources as employees or contractors or outsource the OT security
operation function as a managed security service. Irrespective of the security operation and
resource model used, the responsibility for OT cybersecurity management should be integrated
with IT cybersecurity and the corporate risk management function.
The responsibility and accountability for implementing and managing cybersecurity functions
typically falls under the IT and OT infrastructure organization, whereas cybersecurity operational
metrics and risks are reported to the risk management office. These two lines of reporting
structure need to collaborate in terms of funding and expectations of what can be achieved given
a funding and resource level. The risk executive function works with executive management to
decide the risk tolerance and residual risk.
As part of building a cybersecurity team, the following tasks should be included:
     •     Establish and maintain cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for building, operating,
           and improving an OT cybersecurity program.
     •     Establish cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for third-party providers, which can
           include service providers, contractors, and other organizations that provide OT system
           development and services and security operation and management.
Further guidance for establishing a cross-functional team can be found in Section 4 and
Appendix D. Additional information with specific examples for establishing a cross-functional
team are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile
Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.3. Define the OT Cybersecurity Strategy
An organization-wide risk management strategy is foundational to developing an OT
cybersecurity strategy. 4 The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk
management strategy – including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions,
constraints, priorities, and trade-offs – to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT
cybersecurity program.

  For additional information on developing an organization-wide risk management strategy, refer to NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2],
Prepare Step, Task P-2, Risk Management Strategy. Section 3 provides additional information on organization-level and system-level tasks to
prepare for implementing the NIST Risk Management Framework.



                                                                      39

September 2023

The OT cybersecurity strategy:
   •   Refines and supplements guidance from the organization-wide risk management strategy
       to address OT-specific constraints and requirements
   •   Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel
   •   Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model (e.g., insource, outsource, and/or use
       managed security services)
   •   Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT
       program
   •   Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness
The OT cybersecurity strategy should help refine the organizational risk tolerance for the OT
operation, which in turn drives the priorities for the OT cybersecurity operation. The program
should also address both IT and OT concerns and requirements. For example, IT may consider
data loss or system availability as a higher priority, but OT may value system safety, production
efficiency, and environmental damage as higher priorities.
Further guidance for developing an OT cybersecurity strategy can be found in Section 5, Section
6, Appendix C, and Appendix D. Additional information and specific examples for establishing
an OT cybersecurity strategy are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework
Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.4. Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures are essential to the success of any cybersecurity program. Where
possible, OT-specific security policies and procedures should be derived from existing IT
cybersecurity and plant operational policies and procedures for consistency throughout the
organization.
As discussed earlier, organizational management is responsible for developing and
communicating the risk tolerance level of the organization (i.e., the level of risk that the
organization is willing to accept), which allows the OT cybersecurity manager to determine the
risk management strategy. The development of cybersecurity policies should be based on a risk
assessment that will set the security priorities and goals for the organization. Procedures that
support the policies need to be developed so that the policies are implemented fully and properly
for OT. Cybersecurity procedures should be documented, tested, and updated periodically in
response to policy, technology, and threat changes.
Further guidance for developing OT-specific policies and procedures can be found in Section 6.
Additional information with examples for establishing OT-specific policies and procedures are
also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact
Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

September 2023

3.3.5. Establish a Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for the OT
       Environment
Organizations should ensure that all personnel who interact with OT systems – including
employees, contractors, consultants, and vendors – receive cybersecurity training that is relevant
to the OT environment in addition to general IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training
is used to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles, teach them about their potential
impacts on security and safety, and outline the steps that they need to follow when interacting
with OT systems. Cybersecurity awareness training should be required for new employees at the
time of hire and at regular intervals, as dictated by regulatory requirements and organizational
policies.
Further guidance for OT cybersecurity awareness training can be found in Section 6 and
Appendix D. Additional information with specific examples for OT cybersecurity awareness
training are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile
Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.6. Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT
OT system risk is another risk confronting an organization (e.g., financial, safety, environmental,
IT). In each case, managers responsible for the mission or business function establish and operate
a risk management program in coordination with senior management. NIST SP 800-39,
Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View
[SP800-39], provides a framework for an enterprise-level risk management program, which is
also detailed in Section 4 of this document. OT personnel should be involved in developing the
OT cybersecurity risk management program and communicating with senior management.
NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A
System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy [SP800-37r2], provides a structured
process for managing security and privacy risk. This includes preparing for organization-wide
risk management; system categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment;
system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.
Applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to OT systems is detailed in Section 4.

3.3.7. Develop a Maintenance Tracking Capability
Establish processes and implement tools to ensure that routine and preventative maintenance and
repairs (both local and remote) of OT assets are performed consistent with OT organizational
policies and procedures. The tools used for maintenance logging and tracking should be
controlled and managed. Ensure that the processes and tools allow for scheduling, authorizing,
tracking, monitoring, and auditing maintenance and repair activities for OT assets. If the ability
for remote maintenance is required, ensure that the remote access tool supports the authentication
of maintenance personnel, connection establishment at the beginning of maintenance activities,
and immediate teardown once the maintenance activities are performed. Also ensure that the tool
can log the remote maintenance activities that are performed.

Further guidance for OT maintenance tracking can be found in Section 6. Additional information
with specific examples for OT maintenance tracking are also provided in NIST IR 8183A,
Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations
Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.8. Develop an Incident Response Capability
Organizations should establish an OT cybersecurity incident response (IR) function that should
include planning, detection, analysis, containment, and reporting activities in the case of a
cybersecurity incident. The IR function requires the establishment of several cybersecurity
capabilities, including incident management, forensic analysis, vulnerability management, and
response communication. As part of building the IR function, the OT cybersecurity department
should create an incident response plan. The purpose of the incident response capability is to
determine the scope and risk of cybersecurity incidents, respond appropriately to the incident,
communicate the incident to all stakeholders, and reduce the future impact. This plan applies to
all OT personnel, networks, systems, and data. The IR plan guides the activities of the
cybersecurity team to respond, communicate, and coordinate in the event of a cybersecurity
incident. Without such a plan, the organization will find it extremely difficult to respond when a
cybersecurity incident occurs. The plan includes the roles and responsibilities of personnel, the
incident response workflow, incident type and severity classification, contacts of critical
personnel who should be involved, contacts of external entities that may be useful in assisting
with IR, information sharing policy, and internal and external communication.
Further guidance for OT incident response can be found in Section 6.2.4.5 and Appendix C.
Additional information with specific examples for OT incident response are also provided in
NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example
Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.9. Develop a Recovery and Restoration Capability
The organization should establish the capability to recover from cybersecurity incidents and to
restore the assets and services that were impaired by the cybersecurity incident to a pre-cyber-
incident state. This capability typically includes the following tasks:
   •   Define recovery objectives when recovering from disruptions. For example, the recovery
       capability shall prioritize human safety and environmental safety prior to restarting the
       OT operation that was impaired by the cybersecurity event.
   •   Develop a site disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity plan (BCP) to
       prepare the OT organization to respond appropriately to significant disruptions in their
       operations due to the cybersecurity incident.
   •   Establish backup systems and processes to back up the relevant OT systems’ state, data,
       configuration files, and programs at regular intervals to support recovery to a stable state.
   •   Establish processes for restoring relevant OT systems’ state, data, configuration files, and
       programs from backups in a timely manner.

September 2023

    •   Establish recovery processes and procedures that will be executed to restore the OT
        assets and services affected by cybersecurity incidents.
    •   Establish communication plans to coordinate restoration activities with internal and
        external stakeholders and the executive management team.
    •   Establish communication plans to manage public relations.
    •   Establish a task for lessons learned as part of the recovery process for continuous
        improvement of the cybersecurity capabilities (e.g., vulnerability management,
        cybersecurity operation, incident response handling, and recovery handling).
    •   Test these plans at reasonable intervals that are appropriate for the organization.
Further guidance for OT recovery and restoration can be found in Section 6. Additional
information with specific examples for OT recovery and restoration are also provided in NIST IR
8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example
Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

     Risk Management for OT Systems
Organizations manage risks every day when meeting their business objectives, including
financial losses, equipment failure, and personnel safety. Organizations develop processes to
evaluate the risks associated with their business and to decide how to manage those risks based
on organizational priorities, risk tolerance, and internal and external constraints. This risk
management is an interactive ongoing process that is part of normal operations. Organizations
that use OT systems have historically managed risk through good practices in safety and
engineering. Safety assessments are well established in most sectors and often incorporated into
regulatory requirements. Information security risk management is an added dimension that can
be complementary. The risk management process and framework outlined in this section can be
applied to managing safety, information security, and cyber supply chain risk. Privacy is also a
risk consideration for some OT systems. For additional guidance on privacy risk management,
refer to the NIST Risk Management Framework [SP800-37r2] and the Privacy Framework [PF].
A risk management process is deployed throughout an organization using a three-level approach
to address risk at the (i) organization level, (ii) mission and business process level, and (iii)
system level (i.e., IT and OT). The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the
three levels with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-
related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders
with a shared interest in the success of the organization.
This section focuses primarily on OT system considerations at the system level, though the risk
management activities, information, and artifacts at each level impact and inform the other
levels. Section 6 applies the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems, while Appendix F
provides OT-specific recommendations to augment the NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5]
control families. This section also discusses OT system considerations and the impact that these
considerations have on the risk management process.
For more information on multi-tiered risk management and the risk management process, refer to
NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information
System View [SP800-39]. NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for
Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
[SP800-37r2], provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework to federal
information systems, including conducting the activities of security categorization, 5 security
control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system
authorization, 6 and security control monitoring. NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk
Assessments [SP800-30r1], provides a step-by-step process for organizations on how to (i)
prepare for risk assessments, (ii) conduct risk assessments, (iii) communicate risk assessment
results to key organizational personnel, and (iv) maintain the risk assessments over time.

  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 [FIPS199] provides security categorization guidance for non-national security systems.
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national security systems.

  Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize the operation of an information
system and explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the
implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.

       Managing OT Security Risk
While the risk management process presented in NIST SP 800-39 [SP800-39] applies to all types
of systems, there are some unique aspects to consider when it comes to managing OT system
security risk. As shown in Fig. 13, the risk management process has four components: framing
risk (i.e., establishing the context for risk-based decisions), assessing risk, responding to risk,
and monitoring risk. These activities are interdependent and often occur simultaneously within
an organization. For example, the results of the monitoring component will feed into the framing
component. Because the environment in which organizations operate is always changing, risk
management must be a continuous process in which all components have ongoing activities. It is
important to remember that these components apply to the management of any type of risk,
including cybersecurity, physical security, safety, and financial. Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4
discuss the four components of the risk management process in further detail and provide OT-
specific implementation guidance.

Organization-wide risk management is applied at three levels, as Fig. 14 depicts. Level 1
addresses risk management from the organizational perspective and implements risk framing by
providing context for all risk management activities within the organization. Level 2 addresses
risk from a mission and business process perspective and is informed by the Level 1 risk context,
decisions, and activities. Level 3 addresses risk at the system level and is informed by the Level
1 and 2 activities and outputs.

Together, each of the risk management components (i.e., frame, assess, respond, and monitor)
are applied across the risk management levels, resulting in organization-wide risk awareness and
the traceability and transparency of risk-based decisions.

4.1.1. Framing OT Risk
The framing component consists of the processes for establishing the required assumptions,
constraints, risk tolerances, and risk management strategies for organizations to make consistent
risk management decisions. Specifically, risk framing supports the overall risk management
strategy by incorporating elements from the organizational governance structure, legal/regulatory
environment, and other factors to establish how the organization intends to assess, respond to,
and monitor risk to all IT and OT systems.
                     OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                     For OT system operators, safety directly affects decisions on how
                     systems are engineered and operated. Safety can be defined as “freedom
                     from conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness,
                     damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the
                     environment.” 7 Based on this, human safety impacts are typically
                     evaluated based on the degree of injury, disease, or death that could
                     result from the OT system malfunctioning after a cyber incident, taking
                     into consideration any previously performed safety impact assessments

            regarding the employees and the public. The importance of safety and
            developing a safety culture plays a critical role in determining risk
            tolerance.
            Organizations should consider incorporating an analysis of cybersecurity
            effects on OT systems that impact personnel safety and the environment,
            as well as mitigating controls. More specifically, organizations may want
            to consider employing a comprehensive process to systematically predict
            or identify the operational behavior of each safety-critical failure
            condition, fault condition, or human error that could lead to a hazard or
            potential human harm.
            Organizations may also want to consider the impact of legacy systems
            and components on their environment. Specifically, legacy systems may
            be unable to adequately support cybersecurity to prevent risks from
            exceeding organizational tolerance levels.
            Another major concern for OT system operators is the availability of
            services provided by the OT system. The OT system may be part of
            critical infrastructure (e.g., water or power systems), where there is a
            significant need for continuous and reliable operations. As a result, OT
            systems may have strict requirements for availability or recovery.
            Organizations should understand and plan for the levels of redundancy
            required to achieve the desired resilience for their operating
            environments and incorporate these requirements into their risk framing.
            This will help organizations make risk decisions that avoid unintended
            consequences on those who depend on the services provided. More
            specifically, organizations should consider identifying interdependent
            OT systems that pose cybersecurity risks that threaten system
            availability.
            Additionally, organizations should consider how an incident could
            propagate to a connected system and system components. An OT may be
            interconnected with other systems, such that failures in one system or
            process can easily cascade to other systems either within or outside of
            the organization. Impact propagation could occur due to both physical
            and logical dependencies. Properly communicating the results of risk
            assessments to the operators of connected or interdependent systems and
            processes is one way to manage such impacts.
            Logical damage to an interconnected OT could occur if the cyber
            incident propagates to connected OT systems. For example, a virus or
            worm may propagate to a connected OT and impact that system.
            Physical damage could also propagate to other interconnected OT or
            related physical domains. For example, the impact could result in a
            physical hazard that degrades nearby physical environments or common
            shared dependencies (e.g., power supply) or result in a shortage of
            material that will be needed for a later stage in an industrial process.

CISA promotes a cohesive effort between government and industry to improve their ability to
anticipate, prioritize, and manage national-level OT risk. CISA assists OT system vendors and
asset owners, operators, and other vendors across all critical infrastructure sectors to identify
security vulnerabilities and develop sound, proactive mitigation strategies that strengthen their
OT systems’ cybersecurity posture.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may want to consider incorporating resources such as the
            NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the MITRE ATT&CK
            for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) framework [ATTACK-ICS] into
            their processes for assessing risks to the mission and OT systems.
            Additionally, the nature of OT systems requires organizations to consider
            additional factors that may not exist when conducting risk assessment for
            a traditional IT system. For example, OT will have different threat
            sources, vulnerabilities, and compensating controls than IT. The impact
            of a cyber incident in an OT environment may include both physical and
            digital effects that risk assessments need to incorporate, including:
                   •   Impacts on safety and the use of safety assessments
                   •   Physical impacts of a cyber incident on an OT, including the
                       larger physical environment, and the effect on the process
                       controlled
                   •   The consequences for risk assessments of non-digital control
                       components within an OT
During risk framing, organizations should select appropriate risk assessment methodologies that
include OT. When evaluating the potential physical damage from a cyber incident, organizations
with OT systems may consider i) how a cyber incident could manipulate the operation to impact
the physical environment, ii) what design features exist in the OT system to prevent or mitigate
an impact, and iii) how a physical incident could emerge based on these conditions.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When framing risks within an OT environment, organizations may
            discover that cybersecurity threats are not always as well understood or
            predictable as OT hazards. Organizations may consider incorporating
            cyber attack and IT failure scenarios into their process hazard analysis
            (PHA) or failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) processes. By
            including risks due to cyber attacks and cyber risk management measures
            in these processes, organizations may gain a better understanding of the
            cyber risks to the OT operational environment.
            As part of risk framing, organizations may also need to consider:
                   •   Assumptions about how risk is assessed, responded to, and
                       monitored across the organization
                   •   The risk tolerance for the organization, the level of risk that can
                       be accepted as part of achieving strategic goals and objectives,

                       and the priorities and trade-offs considered as part of managing
                       risk
              In the context of OT, the potential for damage to equipment, human
              safety, the natural environment, and other critical infrastructures is part
              of these considerations. Organizations may need to consider evaluating
              the potential physical impacts for all parts of an OT system.
              Organizations may also need to determine how OT systems interact or
              depend on IT to support risk framing. These processes may require
              organizations to identify a common framework for evaluating impacts
              that incorporate OT considerations. One approach is based on NIST
              FIPS 199 [FIPS199], which specifies that systems are categorized as low
              impact, moderate impact, or high impact for the security objectives of
              confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Another approach that is based
              on ISA 62443-3-2 [ISA62443] provides example definitions for
              determining a system categorization utilizing OT impacts.
Table 3 provides possible example categories and impact levels that organizations may
customize to meet their specific industry or business requirements. For example, some
organizations may see an outage lasting up to one day as a having a high impact instead of
moderate, as shown in the table.

To support the risk assessment process, organizations should also define how the likelihood of
occurrence for cybersecurity events will be determined to maintain consistency when assessing
risks. NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1] provides guidance for organizations to develop
likelihood weighted risk factors. Organizations should consider weighting risk factors based on
an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or
set of vulnerabilities), that the threat event will be initiated, and that the threat event will result in
adverse impacts.
For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on adversary
intent, capability, and targeting. For other-than-adversarial threat events, the likelihood of
occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, and other factors. If
organizations find that there is minimal organizational historical data, they may want to consider
extending their analysis to consider industry-specific data describes cybersecurity events
reported for similar organizations.
The likelihood of threat occurrence can also be based on the state of the organization (e.g., its
core mission and business processes, enterprise architecture, information security architecture,
information systems, and the environments in which those systems operate) and consider
predisposing conditions and the presence and effectiveness of deployed security controls to
protect against unauthorized or undesirable behavior, detect and limit damage, and/or other
resiliency factors for the OT capabilities.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations that establish definitions for event likelihood may want to
             review Appendix G of NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 for more detailed
             guidance and suggestions. Based on this guidance, organizations should
             consider defining five levels of likelihood from Very Low to Very High
             based on both adversarial (i.e., intentional threat actors) and non-
             adversarial (e.g., errors, accidents, acts of nature, etc.) events.
             Additionally, organizations may want to establish definitions for the
             likelihood that an event may result in an adverse impact. Using these two
             factors, organizations can establish a heat map like the one depicted in
             Table 4 to determine the likelihood factor for supporting the risk
             analysis.

4.1.2. Assessing Risk in an OT Environment
Risk assessments leverage the outputs of framing risk (e.g., acceptable risk assessment
methodologies, risk management strategy, and risk tolerance) and facilitate efforts to identify,
estimate, and prioritize risks to operations, assets, individuals, and other organizations. Risk
assessments occur at all risk management levels (i.e., organization, mission and business
function, and system) and can be used to inform risk assessments at other levels. Regardless of
which risk management level the risk assessment is conducted at, assessing risk requires
identifying threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such threats and vulnerabilities may cause,
and the likelihood that adverse events may arise from those threats and vulnerabilities.
When the organization conducts a risk assessment that includes OT systems, there may be
additional considerations that do not exist when assessing the risks of traditional IT systems. For
example, the impact of a cyber incident on an OT may include both physical and digital effects.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Risk assessments are typically point-in-time reports. As a result,
            organizations should ensure that they are updated to remain current and
            that the security level remains adequate.
            Organizations may want to review the information provided by CISA’s
            Alerts and Advisories, NIST’s NVD, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS to
            identify common vulnerability areas for OT environments, such as:
                   •   Poor coding practices, network designs, or device configurations
                   •   Vulnerable network services and protocols
                   •   Weak authentication
                   •   Excessive privileges
                   •   Information disclosure
            OT systems often have specific environmental requirements (e.g., a
            manufacturing process may require a precise temperature), or they may
            be tied to their physical environment for operations. Organizations may
            want to consider incorporating these requirements and constraints into
            the framing component so that associated risks are identified.
            Additionally, organizations may want to consider:
                   •   Identifying the physical assets and security controls that directly
                       relate to safety, human life, and maintaining continuity of
                       operations of the OT system
                   •   Identifying the cybersecurity risks associated with physical assets
                       that could threaten OT system functionality
                   •   Ensuring that physical security personnel understand the relative
                       risks and physical security countermeasures associated with the
                       OT system environments that they protect

NIST SP 800-82r3                                                      Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

                   •    Ensuring that physical security personnel are aware of areas in an
                        OT system production environment that house data acquisition
                        and operate in sensitive spaces
                   •    Mitigating business continuity risks by specifying immediate
                        response plans if physical safety is jeopardized
Risk assessments also require reviewing the digital and non-digital mechanisms that are
implemented to minimize adverse event impacts. OT systems often incorporate non-digital
mechanisms to provide fault tolerance and prevent the OT from acting outside of acceptable
parameters. These non-digital mechanisms may help reduce the negative impacts that a digital
incident on the OT might have and should be incorporated into the risk assessment process. For
example, OT often have non-digital control mechanisms that can prevent it from operating
outside of a safe boundary and thereby limit the impact of an attack (e.g., a mechanical relief
pressure valve). Analog mechanisms (e.g., meters, alarms) can also be used to observe the
physical system state and provide operators with reliable data if digital readings are unavailable
or corrupted. Table 5 categorizes non-digital control mechanisms that could reduce the impact of
an OT incident.
                            Table 5. Categories of non-digital OT control components

  Control Type                                                  Description
                       Non-digital mechanisms measure and display the state of the physical system (e.g.,
                       temperature, pressure, voltage, current) and can provide the operator with accurate

                       information when digital displays are unavailable or corrupted. The information may be
 or alarms
                       provided to the operator on some non-digital display (e.g., thermometers, pressure gauges)
                       and through audible alarms.
                       Manual control mechanisms (e.g., manual valve controls, physical breaker switches) allow
 Manual control        operators to manually control an actuator without relying on the digital OT system. This
 mechanisms            ensures that an actuator can be controlled even if the OT system is unavailable or
                       compromised.
                       Analog control systems use non-digital sensors and actuators to monitor and control a
                       physical process. These may prevent the physical process from entering an undesired state
                       when the digital OT system is unavailable or corrupted. Analog controls include devices such
                       as regulators, governors, and electromechanical relays. An example is a device that is
 Analog control
                       designed to open during emergency or abnormal conditions to prevent the rise of internal
 systems
                       fluid pressure in excess of a specified value, thus bringing the process to a safer state. The
                       device may also be designed to prevent an excessive internal vacuum, such as a pressure
                       relief valve, a non-reclosing pressure relief device (e.g., rupture disc), or a vacuum relief
                       valve.


             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations should analyze all digital and non-digital control
             mechanisms and the extent to which they can mitigate potential negative
             impacts to the OT. For example, non-digital control mechanisms may
             require additional time and human involvement, such as operators
             travelling to a remote site to perform certain control functions. Such
             mechanisms may also depend on human response times, which may be
             slower than automated controls.

Additionally, organizations may need to consider privacy with their risk assessment, which
sometimes require a different approach. The NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology
(PRAM) is a tool that applies the risk model from NIST IR 8062 [IR8062] and helps
organizations analyze, assess, and prioritize privacy risks to determine how to respond and select
appropriate solutions.

4.1.3. Responding to Risk in an OT Environment
The risk response component provides an organization-wide response to risk in accordance with
the risk framing component by identifying possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluating
those possibilities while considering the organization’s risk tolerance and other issues identified
during framing, and choosing the best alternative for the organization. The response component
includes the implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified risk:
acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, transfer, or any combination of these options. 8
                    OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                    For an OT system, available risk responses may be constrained by
                    system requirements, potential adverse impacts on operations, or even
                    regulatory compliance regimes. An example of risk sharing is when
                    utilities enter into agreements to “loan” line workers in an emergency,
                    which reduces the duration of an incident’s effect to acceptable levels.

4.1.4. Monitoring Risk in an OT Environment
Monitoring risk is the fourth component of risk management activities. Organizations monitor
risk on an ongoing basis, including the implementation of chosen risk management strategies,
changes in the environment that may affect the risk calculation, and the effectiveness and
efficiency of risk reduction activities. The activities in the monitoring component impact all of
the other components.
                    OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                    Many OT system monitoring capabilities leverage passive monitoring
                    techniques to detect system changes. However, this may not always
                    capture all modifications to the system. Modern monitoring platforms
                    that leverage native protocol communications to access more system
                    information may improve awareness, but the limitations of these OT
                    systems must be understood. Often OT systems are implemented with an
                    undefined frequency for monitoring cyber activities. Users should set a
                    frequency in accordance with the respective risk profile.
                    Threat information as it relates to the OT environment is evolving, and
                    the availability and accuracy of this threat information is early in its
                    development. By their nature, threats may be difficult to accurately
                    predict, even with historical data. Organizations should categorize threats
                    based on the likelihood of occurrence and their potential consequences.

8
    For additional information on these options, refer to NIST SP 800-39 [SP800-39].



                                                                        53
NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            For example, the threat of an internet-connected system being scanned
            would have a high likelihood and a low severity consequence, but the
            threat of a nation-state actor disrupting a supply chain may have low
            likelihood and high severity consequences.
            Since security countermeasures are typically developed for IT
            environments, organizations should consider how deploying security
            technologies into OT environments may negatively impact operations or
            safety.

       Special Areas for Consideration
Supply chain risk management and risk management for safety are critical aspects of OT
cybersecurity risk management.

4.2.1. Supply Chain Risk Management
Cybersecurity risks can arise from the products or services acquired to support OT needs. These
risks can be introduced anywhere in the supply chain and at any stage in the life cycle. Whether
they are malicious, natural, or unintentional, these risks have the potential to compromise the
availability and integrity of critical OT systems and components, as well as the availability,
integrity, and confidentiality of the data utilized by the OT, thereby causing harms that range
from minor disruptions to impacts on life and safety.
With few exceptions, organizations that are responsible for OT rely upon suppliers, other third-
party providers, and their extended supply chains for a range of needs. These supply-side
organizations perform critical roles and functions, including manufacturing and provisioning
technology products, providing software upgrades and patches, performing integration services,
or otherwise supporting the day-to-day operations and maintenance of OT systems, components,
and operational environments. For this reason, OT organizations should seek to understand and
mitigate the supply chain-related risks that can be inherited from these supply-side organizations
and the products and services that they provide.
Identifying, assessing, and effectively responding to cybersecurity risks in supply chains is best
accomplished by incorporating cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM)
considerations into organizational policies, plans, and practices. This includes extending
cybersecurity expectations and requirements to vendors and gaining better understanding,
visibility, and control over the supply chains that are associated with acquired products and
services. Organizations should vet suppliers and service providers to ascertain their capabilities,
trustworthiness, the adequacy of their internal security practices, the effectiveness of safeguards,
their supply chain relationships, and any risks that may be associated with those relationships
and dependencies. The requirements for and evaluation of products and discrete components
should extend beyond an assessment of whether functional and technical requirements are
satisfied and address applicable C-SCRM factors, such as a product’s provenance, pedigree, and
composition and whether the product is taint-free and authentic. Additionally, special
consideration should be given to how difficult it may be to attain original replacement parts or
updates over the life of the product and how diverse the sources of supply are and may be in the
future.


                                                 54
NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

OT organizations should familiarize themselves with NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk
Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-161], and
begin or continue to implement the key practices, C-SCRM security controls, and C-SCRM risk
management process activities described in that publication. There is extensive guidance about
how to establish a C-SCRM program using a phased approach that begins with putting the
foundational elements in place and expanding upon that foundation over time to ensure sustained
effectiveness and the ability to enhance program capabilities. There is also guidance about
conducting supply chain risk assessments, incorporating C-SCRM into procurement
requirements, the importance of an integrated and inter-disciplinary risk management approach,
supplemental C-SCRM security control guidance, and templates that organizations can leverage.

4.2.2. Safety Systems
The culture of safety and safety assessments is well established within much of the OT user
community. Information security risk assessments should complement such assessments, though
they may use different approaches and cover different areas. Safety assessments are primarily
concerned with the physical world, while information security risk assessments consider the
digital world. However, in an OT environment, the physical and the digital are intertwined, and
significant overlap may occur.
Organizations should, therefore, consider all aspects of risk management for safety (e.g., risk
framing, risk tolerances) and the safety assessment results when carrying out risk assessments for
information security. The personnel responsible for the information security risk assessment
must be able to identify and communicate identified risks that could have safety implications.
Conversely, the personnel charged with safety assessments must be familiar with the potential
physical impacts and their likelihood.
Safety systems may reduce the impact of a cyber incident on the OT and are often deployed to
perform specific monitoring and control functions to ensure the safety of people, the
environment, processes, and assets. While these systems are traditionally implemented to be
fully redundant and independent from the primary OT, some architectures combine control and
safety functions, components, or networks. Combining control and safety could allow a
sophisticated attacker access to both control and safety systems if the OT were compromised.
Organizations should ensure the adequate separation of components consistent with the risk of
compromise and evaluate the impact of the implemented security controls on the safety system to
determine whether they negatively impact the system.

       Applying the Risk Management Framework to OT Systems
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) applies the risk management process and
concepts (i.e., framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk) to systems
and organizations. The following subsections describe the process of applying the RMF to OT
and include a brief description of each step and task, the intended outcome of each task, task
mappings to other standards and guidelines applicable to OT (e.g., the Cybersecurity Framework
and IEC 62443), and OT-specific implementation guidance. Some tasks are optional, and not all
tasks include OT-specific considerations or guidance.

The RMF steps in Fig. 15, while shown sequentially, can be implemented in a different order to
be consistent with established management and system development life cycle processes.

4.3.1. Prepare
The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the organizational, mission
and business process, and system levels to help the organization manage its security and privacy
risks using the RMF. The Prepare step leverages activities that are already being conducted
within cybersecurity programs to emphasize the importance of having organization-wide
governance and resources in place to support risk management. Table 6 provides details on
applying the Prepare step to OT.

4.3.2. Categorize
In the Categorize step, the potential adverse impacts of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the information and system are determined. For each information type and system
under consideration, the three security objectives – confidentiality, integrity, and availability –
are associated with one of three levels of potential impacts of a security breach. Of the three
security objectives, availability is generally the greatest concern for an OT. The standards and
guidance for this categorization process can be found in FIPS 199 [FIPS199] and NIST SP 800-
60 [SP800-60v1r1][SP800-60v2r1], respectively.
The following OT example is taken from FIPS 199:
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A power plant contains a SCADA system controlling the distribution of
            electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA system
            contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative
            information. The management at the power plant determines that: (i) for
            the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system, there is no
            potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential impact
            from a loss of integrity, and a high potential impact from a loss of
            availability; and (ii) for the administrative information being processed
            by the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of
            confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a low
            potential impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security
            categories, SC, of these information types are expressed as:
                   SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH),
                                   (availability, HIGH)}, and
              SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity,
                                 LOW), (availability, LOW)}.
            The resulting security category of the system is initially expressed as:
               SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH),
                                 (availability, HIGH)}
            representing the high-water mark or maximum potential impact values
            for each security objective from the information types resident on the
            SCADA system. The management at the power plant chooses to increase
            the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate,
            reflecting a more realistic view of the potential impact on the system
            should there be a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of
            system-level information or processing functions. The final security
            category of the system is expressed as:
               SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity,
                             HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}

4.3.3. Select
The purpose of the Select step is to select the initial controls to protect the system commensurate
with risk. The control baselines are the starting point for the control selection process and are
chosen based on the security category and associated impact level of the systems identified in the
Categorize step. NIST SP 800-53B [SP800-53B] identifies the recommended control baselines
for federal systems and information. To address the need for developing community-wide and
specialized sets of controls for systems and organizations, the concept of overlays is introduced.
An overlay is a fully specified set of controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance
derived from the application of tailoring guidance to security control baselines described in NIST
SP 800-53B, Appendix C.
In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by
organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more
closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Appendix F of this
publication includes an OT-specific overlay of applicable NIST SP 800-53 controls that provides
tailored baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact OT. These tailored
baselines are starting specifications and recommendations that can be applied to specific OT by
responsible personnel.

September 2023

OT owners can tailor the overlay from Appendix F when it is not possible or feasible to
implement specific controls. The use of overlays does not in any way preclude organizations
from performing further tailoring (i.e., overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to reflect
organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. However, all tailoring activities should
primarily focus on meeting the intent of the original controls whenever possible or feasible. For
example, when the OT cannot support or the organization determines that it is not advisable to
implement particular controls or control enhancements in an OT (e.g., performance, safety, or
reliability are adversely impacted), the organization should provide a complete and convincing
rationale for how the selected compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or
level of protection for the OT and why the related baseline controls could not be employed. If the
OT cannot support the use of automated mechanisms, the organization employs nonautomated
mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
guidance in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53. Compensating controls are not exceptions or
waivers to the baseline controls. Rather, they are alternative safeguards and countermeasures
employed within the OT that accomplish the intent of the original controls that could not be
effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are
documented in the security plan for the OT.

4.3.4. Implement
The Implement step involves the implementation of controls in new or legacy systems. The
control selection process described in this section can be applied to OT from two perspectives:
new development and legacy.
For new development systems, the control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial
security categorizations. The controls included in the security plans for the systems serve as
security specifications and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the
development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle.
In contrast, the security control selection process for legacy systems is applied from a gap
analysis perspective when organizations anticipate significant changes to the systems (e.g.,
during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the systems already exist,
organizations have likely completed the security categorization and security control selection
processes, resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon controls in the respective
security plans and the implementation of those controls within the systems.

4.3.5. Assess
The Assess step of the RMF determines the extent to which the controls in the system are
effective in their application and producing the desired results. NIST SP 800-53A [SP800-
53Ar5] provides guidance for assessing selected controls from NIST SP 800-53 to ensure that
they are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
respect to meeting the security requirements of the system.

4.3.6. Authorize
The Authorize step involves a management decision to authorize the operation of a system and
explicitly accept the risks to operations, assets, and individuals based on the implementation of
an agreed-upon set of controls. A new system is not placed into production or operation until the
system is authorized.

   OT Cybersecurity Architecture
When designing a security architecture for an OT environment, it is generally recommended to
separate the OT network(s) from the corporate network. The nature of network traffic on these
two network types is different. For example, internet access, email, and remote access are
typically permitted on the corporate network but not allowed on OT networks. There may also be
differences in the degree of rigor associated with corporate and OT environment change control
procedures. Additionally, using the corporate network for OT communication protocols could
expose the OT components to cyber attacks (e.g., DoS, adversary-in-the-middle or other
network-based attacks). Utilizing separate networks allows for greater flexibility to address
security and performance requirements between the two environments.
Practical considerations – such as digital transformation, the cost of OT installation, or
maintaining a homogenous network infrastructure – often mean that a connection is required
between OT and corporate or other IT networks. This connection represents additional risk, and
organizations may want to minimize these connections and consider additional security controls
for them. This section outlines security strategies for organizations to consider when engineering
their OT environments to support cybersecurity objectives.

       Cybersecurity Strategy
The adoption of a cybersecurity strategy can result in a more systematic implementation of risk
decisions into system development and operation. A comprehensive and accepted cybersecurity
strategy can assist an organization with consistently maintaining acceptable risk management
throughout the life cycle of an OT system.
System security is optimized by engineering design that is based on a proactive loss prevention
strategy. Such a strategy includes planned measures that are engineered to address what can
happen rather than what is likely to happen in order to proactively identify and rid the system of
weaknesses and defects that lead to security vulnerabilities, understand the certainty and
uncertainty of adversarial and non-adversarial threats, and put in place the means and methods to
protect against adverse consequences. Proactive systems security engineering also includes
planning for failure regardless of whether the failure results from adversarial or non-adversarial
events and ensuring that the system is resilient to such events.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When planning a security strategy, organizations may need to consider
            critical infrastructure standards and regulatory requirements. Based on
            guidance from CISA, organizations may find that both IT and OT
            environments fall within the critical infrastructure sectors. These
            standards and requirements are typically designed to protect critical
            cyber assets to support reliability and may carry additional legal
            obligations for the organization.

5.1.1. Impacts of Choosing a Cybersecurity Strategy
By consciously choosing to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy, an organization
establishes a disciplined approach that considers all aspects of the system life cycle – from
procurement to decommissioning – with cybersecurity in mind. As a result, the organization can
ensure that cybersecurity goals are realized in its systems.
Decisions on cybersecurity strategy should flow from a high-level understanding of the
operations, objectives, and cybersecurity goals of the organization. For example, the organization
may want its systems to display certain characteristics, such as resiliency or trustworthiness. The
strategy provides a framework for incorporating those characteristics into the final systems. The
strategy can also include additional considerations, such as the flexibility to adopt new
technologies (e.g., crypto agility, artificial intelligence [AI] and machine learning [ML]
technologies, digital twins). Finally, the strategy can state the need for sound cybersecurity
practices, such as patching or monitoring.
The cybersecurity strategy should directly impact the architectural decisions made for systems.
The existence of an architecture informed by a cybersecurity strategy increases the likelihood
that high-level cybersecurity goals will be reflected in the cybersecurity of individual systems.
The strategy provides a document and reminder of those goals when decisions are being made at
the system level.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT assets often have long life cycles and reflect massive investments in
            operational, reliability, and safety testing. It is sometimes neither
            economically nor technically feasible to replace existing equipment and
            applications wholesale with newer alternatives in the short- or medium-
            term. Such equipment is at greater risk of attacks than equipment with
            the latest versions of security features and security updates. The adoption
            of a cybersecurity strategy can assist an organization in understanding
            the life cycle of its OT systems and adjusting its approaches to
            maintaining security.

5.1.2. Defense-in-Depth Strategy
Defense in depth is a multifaceted strategy that integrates people, technology, and operational
capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and dimensions of the
organization. Many cybersecurity architectures incorporate the principles of defense in depth. It
is considered best practice and integrates into numerous standards and regulatory frameworks.
The basic concepts are to prevent single points of failure in cybersecurity defenses and to assume
no single origin of threats. From this position, cybersecurity controls are organized to provide
layers of protection around the critical system and system components.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A defense-in-depth strategy is particularly useful in OT environments
            because it can focus attention and defensive mechanisms on critical
            functions. Additionally, the principles of defense in depth are flexible



                                                67
NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            and can be applied to a wide range of OT environments, including ICS,
            SCADA, Internet of Things (IoT), IIoT, and hybrid environments.
            Defense in depth requires an integration of people, processes, and
            technology to be effective. Additionally, cybersecurity defenses are not
            static and require changes and updates as risks change for the
            environment. To help establish and support an effective defense-in-depth
            architecture, organizations should consider:
                   •   Training people to support the security environment and reduce
                       risky behaviors
                   •   Implementing appropriate and sustainable cybersecurity
                       technology
                   •   Implementing procedures to monitor, respond, and adapt
                       cybersecurity defenses to changing conditions

5.1.3. Other Cybersecurity Strategy Considerations
Traditional OT systems were designed to operate industrial processes safely and reliably without
connections to external networks. However, due to the need for business agility and cost
reduction for OT infrastructures, OT systems and networks are becoming more integrated into
business networks and cloud infrastructures. Additionally, the introduction of IIoT systems into
OT environments may have unintended cybersecurity consequences.
Similarly, cloud computing capabilities (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service,
software as a service, and security as a service) are increasingly being utilized by organizations.
While the use of these capabilities to support IT services is relatively well understood, the ability
to utilize these services to support OT environments may have additional availability challenges
resulting from increased sensitivity to system performance levels or connection issues. As a
result, the adoption of a security architecture strategy may be impacted by the current state of
existing OT environments. For example, based on the architectural strategy, procurement
decisions might be adjusted to include migrating specific components to support the new
strategy. Organizations may also find that existing systems already support some or most of the
security architecture strategy, so building on these existing capabilities could accelerate the
strategy implementation. Additionally, new OT environments provide an opportunity to evaluate
cyber risk early on and build cybersecurity into the design.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should ensure that their security architecture strategy
            provides the required flexibility to evolve their environment while also
            carefully considering the impacts to operations and cybersecurity.

September 2023

       Defense-in-Depth Architecture Capabilities
Many organizations are embracing digital transformation initiatives that require altering their OT
environments and developing strategies that provide a multi-tiered information architecture by
supporting organization objectives, such as:
   •   Maintenance of field devices, telemetry collection, or industrial-level process systems
   •   Enhanced data collection and dissemination
   •   Remote access
Overall, integration between IT and OT is increasing as organizations adapt to changing local
and global needs and requirements. Utilizing the principles of a defense-in-depth architecture to
systematically layer security controls – including people, processes, and technology – can help
organizations strengthen their overall cybersecurity defenses. As a result, adversaries may find it
increasingly difficult to penetrate the environment without detection. The following sections
discuss specific defense-in-depth layers, including topics and ideas for organizations to consider
when developing and implementing their defense-in-depth cybersecurity architecture. The layers
are:
   •   Layer 1 – Security Management
   •   Layer 2 – Physical Security
   •   Layer 3 – Network Security
   •   Layer 4 – Hardware Security
   •   Layer 5 – Software Security

5.2.1. Layer 1 – Security Management
Security management or governance is the overarching cybersecurity program that supports the
OT environment. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the program and risk management considerations for
organizations to establish their cybersecurity programs. These programmatic and organizational
decisions will guide and impact the decisions made for the other defense-in-depth layers. As a
result, organizations should complete this layer before attempting to implement the other layers.

5.2.2. Layer 2 – Physical Security
Physical security measures are designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or
damage to assets and the surrounding environment. Safeguarded assets may include control
systems, tools, equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual
property, including proprietary data (e.g., process settings and customer information).
Organizations may also need to consider additional environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and
other requirements when implementing physical security.




                                                69
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes:
   •   Protection of physical locations. Classic physical security considerations typically
       include an architecture of layered security measures that create several physical barriers
       around buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, and other informational assets. Physical
       security controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include
       fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and
       cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.
   •   Physical access control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for
       operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and contained within cabinets or under
       floors. Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in
       secured areas. Keys of OT assets, like PLCs and safety systems, should be in the “Run”
       position at all times unless they are being actively programmed.
   •   Access monitoring systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance
       capabilities, such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g.,
       badge readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices do not typically
       prevent access to a particular location. Rather, they store and record either the physical
       presence or the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other
       physical entities. Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access
       monitoring device deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action
       upon the detection of unauthorized access.
   •   People and asset tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important
       for both safety and security reasons. Asset location technologies can be used to track the
       movements of people and vehicles to ensure that they stay in authorized areas, to identify
       personnel who may need assistance, and to support emergency response.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider whether the physical security of remote
            assets is implemented at differing levels and whether those differences
            could create cyber risks. For example, one remote location may utilize
            only a padlock with minimal electronic surveillance to secure access to
            network equipment that, if bypassed, could allow a malicious actor to
            gain access to an OT network segment from the remote location.
            Organizations should also consider whether secondary services, such as
            the communications and power that support physical security devices
            (e.g., cameras, sensors, etc.), require additional redundancy, isolation,
            protection, and monitoring.




                                                70

September 2023

5.2.3. Layer 3 – Network Security
Building from physical security, organizations should investigate network communications and
how to protect the data and devices used to support their OT environment. This section focuses
on several foundational elements to assist organizations with planning and implementing their
network security capabilities. These include applying the network architecture principles of
segmentation and isolation, centralizing logging, network monitoring, and malicious code
protection. Additionally, this section discusses zero trust architecture (ZTA) and considerations
for applying these architecture enhancements to an OT environment.

5.2.3.1.       Network Architecture
A good practice for network architectures is to characterize, segment, and isolate IT and OT
devices. For example, devices may be segmented based on management authority, level of trust,
functional criticality, data flow, location, or other logical combinations. Organizations may also
consider using an industry-recognized model to organize their OT network segmentation, such as
the Purdue model [Williams], ISA-95 levels [IEC62264], the three-tier IIoT system architecture
[IIRA19], or a combination of these models.




                                                71

September 2023

Additional, organizations may consider incorporating a DMZ as an enforcement boundary
between network segments, as depicted in Fig. 16. Implementing network segmentation utilizing
levels, tiers, or zones allows organizations to control access to sensitive information and
components while also considering operational performance and safety.




  Fig. 16. High-level example of the Purdue model and IIoT model for network segmentation with DMZ
                                              segments

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Whether using a risk-based approach, functional model, or other
            organizing principle, grouping components into levels, tiers, or zones is a
            precursor activity before organizations can consider applying isolation
            devices to protect and monitor communications between levels, tiers, or
            zones. When organizing assets, organizations should consider how the
            zone and isolation configuration impact their day-to-day operations,
            safety, and response capabilities.
When properly configured, network architectures support segmentation and isolation by
enforcing security policies and controlling network communications. Organizations typically
utilize their mapped data flows to identify required communications. These requirements are
then incorporated into the network architecture and configured into the policy engines of the
network devices to support monitoring communication between segments and permitting only
authorized communications. Network devices that support traffic enforcement capabilities (e.g.,
switches, routers, firewalls, and unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) can be used to
implement network segmentation and isolation.




                                                72
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Firewalls are commonly used to support network isolation and employed as boundary protection
devices to control connections and information flows between network segments. Firewalls may
be deployed as network devices or directly run on some hosts. Firewalls are very flexible
isolation devices and typically constitute the primary mechanism for protecting OT devices.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Appropriate firewall configuration is essential to properly securing the
            network segments. Firewall rulesets should be established to only permit
            connections between adjacent levels, tiers, or zones. For example,
            organizations that utilize a Purdue model architecture should implement
            firewall rules and connection paths that prevent Level 4 devices from
            directly communicating with Level 2, 1, or 0 devices. A similar concept
            would be applied to ISA/IEC 62443 and IIC architectures.
            One area of considerable variation in practice associated with firewall
            rules is the control of outbound traffic from the control network.
            Allowing outbound connections from lower levels, tiers, or zones could
            represent a significant risk if unmanaged. Organizations should consider
            making outbound rules as stringent as inbound rules to reduce these
            risks.
            An alternative to firewalls is a unidirectional gateway or data diode that
            permits authorized communication in only one direction. The use of
            unidirectional gateways may provide additional protections associated
            with system compromises at higher levels or tiers within the
            environment. For example, a unidirectional gateway deployed between
            Layers 2 and 3 may protect Layer 0, 1, and 2 devices from a
            cybersecurity event that occurs at Layers 3, 4, or 5.

5.2.3.2.       Centralized Logging
Network and computing devices (e.g., routers, gateways, switches, firewalls, servers, and
workstations) should be configured to log events to support monitoring, alerting, and incident
response analysis. Logging capabilities are typically available for recording events in
applications, OSs, and network communications. A centralized log management platform can
assist organizations with supporting log retention, monitoring, and analysis efforts.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should review their available logging capabilities and
            configure them to record the operational and cybersecurity events that
            are appropriate for their environment.
            Organizations should establish how long event logs should be retained
            and ensure that adequate storage is available to support log retention
            requirements.




                                                73
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.2.3.3.       Network Monitoring
Network monitoring involves reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for signs of possible
cybersecurity incidents. Tools and capabilities that support behavior anomaly detection (BAD),
security information and event management (SIEM), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and
intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout
the network and generate alerts when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other
capabilities to consider for network monitoring include:
   •   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the
       network
   •   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications
   •   Diagnosing network performance issues
   •   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices
Organizations may also want to consider incorporating additional services and capabilities, such
as threat intelligence monitoring, to assist with establishing and maintaining an effective network
monitoring capability.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT system traffic is typically more deterministic (i.e., repeatable,
            predictable, and designed) than IT network traffic, which can leveraged
            to support network monitoring for anomaly and error detection.
            Organizations should understand the normal state of the OT network as a
            prerequisite for implementing network security monitoring to help
            distinguish attacks from transient conditions or normal operations within
            the environment. Implementing network monitoring in a passive (e.g.,
            listen or learning) mode and analyzing the information to differentiate
            between known and unknown communication may be a necessary first
            step in implementing network security monitoring.
            Organizations should consider the effects of encrypted network
            communications on their network monitoring capabilities and
            deployment strategies. For example, a BAD system or IDS may be
            unable to determine whether encrypted network communication is
            malicious and could generate false positive or negative alerts for the
            traffic. Changing the data collection point to capture network traffic
            before or after encryption (e.g., using host-based network monitoring
            tools) could help improve monitoring capabilities when encrypted
            communication is expected.
            IDS and IPS products are effective at detecting and preventing well-
            known internet attacks, and some IDS and IPS vendors have
            incorporated attack signatures for various OT protocols, such as Modbus,
            Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3), and Inter-Control Center
            Communications Protocol (ICCP). An effective IDS/IPS deployment
            typically involves both host-based and network-based capabilities.


                                                74
NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Organizations should consider the impact that automated responses
            associated with IPS may have on the OT environment before deploying.
            In some cases, organizations may consider placing IPS units at higher
            levels in the environment (e.g., the DMZ interfaces) to minimize
            potential issues with automated responses impacting OT.
            In OT environments, network-based monitoring capabilities are typically
            deployed on boundary protection devices using switched port analyzer
            (SPAN) ports or passive network taps. Organizations should also
            consider deploying host-based monitoring capabilities on compatible OT
            devices – such as HMIs, SCADA servers, and engineering workstations
            – to improve monitoring capabilities, provided that the addition of the
            tools does not adversely impact operational performance or safety.

5.2.3.4.       Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
A ZTA is a cybersecurity paradigm that focuses on protecting resources (e.g., information
services, data) based on the premise that authorization decisions are made closer to the resource
being requested and are continuously evaluated rather than implicitly granted [SP800-207].
Conventional network security focuses on segmentation and perimeter defenses. Once inside the
network perimeter, users are typically considered “trusted” and often given broad access to
accessible resources. As a result, boundary protection devices between zones do not mitigate
lateral movement risks within a zone. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of distributed
computing, wireless and cellular communications, and cloud and hybrid-cloud environments,
traditional network perimeters and boundaries are becoming less defined. For these situations,
organizations might consider incorporating the principles of zero trust into their security
architecture.
Some challenges to implementing a ZTA include:
   •   Organizations may not find a suitable single solution for a ZTA and may instead need to
       integrate several technologies with varying maturity levels to support their environment.
   •   Implementing zero trust principles into an existing environment may require more
       investments in time, resources, and technical ability.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Some OT components (e.g., PLCs, controllers, HMI) may not support
            the technologies or protocols required to fully integrate with a ZTA
            implementation. As a result, a ZTA implementation might not be
            practical for some OT devices. Instead, organizations should consider
            applying a ZTA to compatible devices, such as those typically found at
            the functionally higher levels of the OT architecture (e.g., Purdue model
            Levels 3, 4, 5, and the OT DMZ).
            Organizations may also want to consider whether any adverse impacts
            might occur, such as if the ZTA solution increases the latency to respond
            to resource requests or if one or more ZTA components become
            unavailable. Based on this analysis, organizations should consider


                                                75
NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            adjusting the ZTA implementations to minimize latency and ensure
            adequate redundancy to minimize risks to OT and safety operations.
            Another important aspect of ZTA implementations is the identity of
            person and non-person entities accessing resources. Within OT
            environments, shared credentials may be utilized, which could impact
            the ability to fully implement a ZTA solution.

5.2.4. Layer 4 – Hardware Security
Hardware security protection mechanisms provide the foundation for supporting security and
trust for the devices within an environment. Once device trust is established, the state must be
maintained and tracked in accordance with the system model and policy. To support these
capabilities, some vendors provide embedded technology, such as the Trusted Platform Module
(TPM), or hardware implementation for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Overall, hardware security capabilities enhance endpoints to
provide specific function and security requirements, including:
   •   Monitoring and analysis
   •   Secure configuration and management
   •   Endpoint hardening
   •   Integrity protection
   •   Access control
   •   Device identity
   •   Root of trust
   •   Physical security
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should review available hardware security and automated
            capabilities to determine how they can support OT environments without
            impacting operational performance, safety, or capabilities.

5.2.5. Layer 5 – Software Security
Software security protection mechanisms provide organizations with capabilities to ensure that
applications and services supporting OT are used and maintained properly. Overall, software
security capabilities can enhance endpoint security when organizations incorporate:
   •   Application allowlisting
   •   Patching
   •   Secure code development
   •   Configuration management, including application hardening



                                               76
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.2.5.1.       Application Allowlisting
Application allowlisting technologies provide an additional protection mechanism on hosts by
restricting which applications are allowed to execute. When properly configured, non-authorized
applications will not execute on the host environment.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The relatively static nature of OT environments presents an opportunity
            for organizations to include application allowlisting as part of their
            defense-in-depth strategy and is a recommended best practice by DHS.
            When considering application allowlisting within an OT environment,
            organizations should coordinate with their vendors and review available
            implementation guidance, such as NIST SP 800-167, Guide to
            Application Whitelisting [SP800-167]; Guidelines for Application
            Whitelisting in Industrial Control Systems; or relevant guidance for their
            industry. The configurations and policies should be thoroughly tested
            before being deployed to ensure that the rules and settings properly
            support organizational security objectives.

5.2.5.2.       Patching
Patches have two main purposes: to address vulnerabilities and to enhance functionality. In the
context of defense-in-depth software security, patching is associated with reducing
vulnerabilities. As a result, patch management is a defense-in-depth capability that supports
vulnerability management as part of an organizational risk management strategy.
Deploying patches to OT environments requires additional considerations for organizations,
including testing and validation to ensure that the patches do not impact operational capabilities
or safety. OT operational requirements can also impact the frequency with which patches are
applied. For example, some OT environments must run nearly continuously for extended periods
of time or have small maintenance windows for applying approved updates. Additionally,
patching older OT components that run on unsupported OSs may not be an option. In these
cases, organizations may want to consider updating their OSs or investing in additional controls
that can protect the environment from attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. Some tools,
such as web application firewalls (WAF) and IPS, could be configured to provide additional
protection to detect or prevent attacks against unpatched vulnerabilities while the organization
waits for an opportunity to apply the updates. Other tools, such as bump-in-the-wire security
devices, can be installed in line with devices that cannot be updated or are using obsolete
operating systems.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Whenever possible, patches should be tested on a sandbox system (i.e.,
            test environment) to ensure that they do not cause problems before being
            deployed into a production system. Organizations should plan patches
            and updates during scheduled maintenance windows for the environment
            and have a recovery plan for the OT component or system being patched.




                                                77

September 2023

            Organizations should also consider that different levels, tiers, and zones
            may have different availability requirements and, as such, may have
            different abilities to support patching. Whenever possible, organizations
            should prioritize patching components within DMZ environments and
            when vulnerabilities exist that impact availability and integrity or would
            allow unauthorized remote access to the OT environment.

5.2.5.3.       Secure Code Development
Organizations that develop in-house systems and components should incorporate policies and
procedures that support and validate secure code development practices into the cybersecurity
program. The software development life cycle (SDLC) should include security during each phase
of software development. This should include security reviews and coding techniques for each of
the following processes:
   •   Using or developing tools to audit and automate secure code techniques
   •   Testing and reviewing code to comply with secure coding practices
   •   Testing the software for security errors in programming
For organizations that procure components or services from third parties, reviewing these same
practices should be considered prior to executing contracts with vendors. Organizations can help
industries move toward more secure products by requesting these practices in their service-level
agreements and procurement actions.

5.2.5.4.       Configuration Management
Applying configuration management practices that support secure configurations and application
hardening is important to meet organizational and regulatory security requirements. These
settings may include setting access controls to restrict access or enabling encryption to protect
data at rest or in transit. Application hardening procedures may include disabling or blocking
specific network communication ports, application features, or unnecessary services that run on
the system.
Encrypting data that flows over networks (i.e., in transit) or data stored in memory and local
storage (i.e., at rest) can also be used in defending OT. Encryption prevents an attacker from
viewing or modifying cleartext data streams. Because encryption and the subsequent decryption
process use algorithms to create ciphers, encryption adds latency and may not be suitable for all
OT devices. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of encryption can help organizations
make an informed decision on where to include encryption in the defense-in-depth strategy.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider using encryption to support secure
            connections or conduits for OT environments when the connections must
            pass over non-OT network segments, such as the corporate network or
            the internet. Virtual private network (VPN) connections should also use
            encryption protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Internet
            Protocol Security (IPsec), to secure the data.


                                                78
NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Encryption can also be used on hard local storage to protect information
            at rest. Full disk encryption is recommended for portable laptops and
            devices. Organizations may also want to consider encrypting folders that
            contain sensitive files.
            Organizations must also consider that encryption can negatively impact
            other defense tools, such as network monitoring. For example, an IDS
            might not be able to determine whether an encrypted packet is malicious,
            resulting in either false-positive or false-negative alerts.
            Organizations should also create procedures to manage changes to
            control logic to protect against the risk that improperly tested or
            malicious changes to logic could disrupt the system.

       Additional Cybersecurity Architecture Considerations
Organizations should include considerations for supporting cyber-related safety, availability,
geographically distributed systems, environmental considerations, and regulatory requirements
into the security architecture designs and implementations for OT and IIoT environments. The
following subsections discuss these considerations in more detail.

5.3.1. Cyber-Related Safety Considerations
OT systems are generally designed with specific safety goals, depending on both the business
environment and regulatory requirements. Organizations should consider whether the additional
communication and cybersecurity requirements of safety systems (e.g., segmentation and the
isolation of safety systems from other OT systems) is required. Additionally, safety requirements
can influence the selection of security mechanisms. For example, safety considerations may
require that an organization use physical separation as opposed to logical separation.
OT systems typically employ fail-to-a-known-state design (i.e., fail-safe design) in the event of
an unexpected situation or a component failure. Fail-safe design considers placing the equipment
or process in a safe state that prevents injury to individuals or the destruction of property and
avoids cascading events or secondary hazards. Cyber-related events, such as the loss of network
communications, could trigger these fail-safe events. To minimize false positives, organizations
should define the thresholds at which OT components can operate with reduced or disrupted
capabilities, such as lost network communications.

5.3.2. Availability Considerations
Operational continuity management requires managing availability at multiple levels, including
data, applications, IT infrastructure, power, and other supporting utilities (e.g., HVAC, water,
steam, compressed air, etc.). The failure of these systems can have a cascading effect on OT
systems and can adversely impact the OT operation. Different availability considerations are
presented below.




                                                79
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.3.2.1.       Data, Applications, and Infrastructure
Architecture requirements and design should support the redundancy needs of OT systems.
Availability can be enhanced using redundancy at the communication, system, or component
level such that a single failure is less likely to result in a capability or information outage.
Cybersecurity architecture should consider any redundant communication and protect it to the
same security level as the primary.
Additionally, a data backup and restoration process will facilitate the speedy recovery of systems
if data is lost due to cyber attacks or other reasons. Examples of important data and files are
operational data, program files, configuration files, system images, firewall rules, and access
control lists (ACLs). A “backup-in-depth” approach with multiple layers of backups (e.g., local,
facility, disaster) that are time-sequenced such that rapid recent local backups are available for
immediate use and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident (e.g.,
ransomware attack) can help improve OT system availability. Periodically testing data backup
and restore capabilities will ensure their availability when the need arises.

5.3.2.2.       Primary and Alternate Power Sources
Architectural considerations should include the impact of power outages on OT systems. For
example, if the OT systems need a graceful degradation or orderly shutdown, then an alternate
backup power may be considered. In addition, if the organization’s business continuity plan
requires that the OT systems continue operating in the event of an extended loss of the primary
power source, a long-term alternate power supply for the OT systems that is self-contained and
not reliant on external power generation can be implemented. The monitoring and controls
systems for the power system are vulnerable to cyber attacks, so appropriate cybersecurity
practices should be implemented.

5.3.2.3.       Other Utilities
Industrial facilities typically have monitoring and controls systems that manage uninterruptable
power supplies (UPSs), generators, HVAC, fire alarm systems, boilers, cooling water plant,
steam, compressed air, and other critical functions. These monitoring and controls systems are
also vulnerable to cyber attacks and can affect the OT systems, so appropriate cybersecurity
practices should be implemented to protect them.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Disaster recovery planning is another important activity for OT systems,
            especially when there are safety concerns. Organizations should establish
            and maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP) that details the actions to
            take before, during, and after a natural, environmental, or human-caused
            (intentionally or unintentionally) disaster. The DRP should also include
            instructions for restoring and restarting failed components and
            integrating them back into operation. Organizations should consider
            testing the DRP to ensure that the necessary architecture capabilities can
            be operationalized in an actual disaster recovery scenario. Tabletop
            exercises can also be used to simulate a disaster recovery event to
            support testing.


                                                80

September 2023

5.3.3. Geographically Distributed Systems
Many critical infrastructure industries have sites that are geographically distributed.
Organizations should consider whether differences in physical security at remote locations create
risks to the OT operational capabilities or safety. The necessary cybersecurity and
communication infrastructure should be provided at the remote sites to protect them from cyber
threats and to communicate cybersecurity monitoring information.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The communication between sites should be encrypted and authenticated
            end to end, whether the connection is via point-to-point link, satellite, or
            internet. Organizations should also ensure that adequate bandwidth is
            provisioned for collecting cyber monitoring data in addition to the
            operational data from remote locations.
            If the organization has several geographically dispersed sites, it should
            consider whether security operation will be managed from a central
            security operations center (SOC) or regionally distributed SOCs. The
            availability of qualified personnel can impact these decisions.

5.3.4. Regulatory Requirements
Regulated industries must consider cyber-related regulatory requirements when designing their
cybersecurity architecture. For example, NERC Standard CIP-005 (see Appendix D.1.9)
provides cybersecurity architecture requirements for bulk electric systems. Similar requirements
and guidance exist for other regulated industries.

5.3.5. Environmental Considerations
Organizations should conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether any of their processes or
equipment pose environmental hazards. If potential environmental hazards due to cybersecurity
failure have been identified, organizations should consider architectural measures to prevent
them.

5.3.6. Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations
Many of the devices and the communication protocols at the Field I/O level (Purdue Level 0)
(e.g., sensors, actuators) cannot be authenticated. Without authentication, there is the potential to
replay, modify, or spoof data. Organizations should make a risk-based decision to decide where
within the OT system (e.g., the most critical process) the use of mitigating security controls (e.g.,
digital twins, separate Field I/O monitoring network) should be implemented to detect incorrect
data.




                                                 81
NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.3.7. Additional Security Considerations for IIoT
The introduction of IIoT to OT environments can increase connectivity and information
exchanges with enterprise systems and cloud-based systems, which may require additional
considerations for the security architecture. For example, the introduction of IIoT devices in OT
environments may require altering boundaries or exposing more interfaces and services.
Additionally, the security capabilities of IIoT devices may need to be considered when
developing the security architecture.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may need to consider the impacts of supporting IIoT on
            policy management, enforcement, and governance. Additionally, the
            integration of IIoT into OT environments may require a tighter
            collaboration between IT and OT security teams to manage the security
            operations. For example, real-time situational awareness should be
            shared between IT and OT security teams.

5.3.7.1.       Application and Infrastructure
Organizations should consider the IIoT data flow use cases, including those that share data
externally, to determine whether additional access control mechanisms are necessary.
Organizations should also consider that the attack vectors for IIoT may be different from those
managed for OT environments (e.g., due to increased communications requirements or the use of
additional services, such as cloud systems, to support operational requirements).
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the following endpoint security
            capabilities of the IIoT devices being deployed:
                   •   Endpoint tamper resistance capabilities
                   •   Endpoint root of trust
                   •   Endpoint identity
                   •   Endpoint access control
                   •   Endpoint integrity protection
                   •   Endpoint data protection
                   •   Endpoint monitoring and analysis
                   •   Endpoint configuration and management
                   •   Cryptographic techniques
                   •   Capability to harden endpoints

September 2023

5.3.7.2.       Cybersecurity Capability Considerations
Compute resources – including processing, memory, and storage – vary among IIoT devices.
Some IIoT devices may have constrained resources, while others may have unused capabilities,
both of which have implications for cybersecurity. Organizations should consider how the
resources and capabilities available in the IIoT devices will integrate into the security
architecture to achieve their cybersecurity objectives. Additionally, organizations should
consider whether the operational and safety impacts for IIoT differ from the operational and
safety impacts for other OT devices. For example, IIoT devices may support a separate data
monitoring (i.e., read-only capability) for the environment and have minimal impact on
operational controls or safety, which may allow organizations to implement security operations
differently than those established for OT devices.

       Cybersecurity Architecture Models
Building on the concepts and guidance from Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, the following subsections
expand on the general OT and IIoT environments described in Section 2 and provide examples
for how the environments might be adapted to support defense-in-depth security architectures.

5.4.1. Distributed Control System (DCS)-Based OT Systems
As described in Section 2, a distributed control system (DCS) is used to control production
systems within the same geographic location for industries. Figure 17 shows an example DCS
system implementation. Figure 18 shows an example defense-in-depth architecture applied to
the DCS system.

September 2023

In Fig. 18, the assumption is that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 and Layer 2.
For Layer 3, the organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities into the
security architecture:
   •   Separate networks into different levels or zones. In this example, the devices are split into
       different levels based on function. The field level includes devices that are typically
       found in the Purdue model levels 0, 1, and 2. The operations management level includes
       devices for monitoring and managing the field level devices and the Purdue level 3
       components. The DMZ includes devices that support bridging the operations
       management and enterprise tiers. Organizations should also consider whether additional
       network segments are required for safety or security systems (e.g., physical monitoring
       and access controls, doors, gates, cameras, Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP], access
       card readers). Network segmentation is an important step in applying a defense-in-depth
       strategy.
   •   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added to control and monitor communications
       between different levels. Industrial-class firewalls are sometimes used between the field
       and operations management levels to provide additional support for OT-specific
       protocols or to allow devices to operate in harsh environments. Rules for both inbound
       and outbound communication should be defined so that only authorized communication
       passes between adjacent levels.
   •   Implement a DMZ to separate the OT environment from the enterprise network. Any
       communications between the enterprise level and the operations management level are
       required to go through services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside
       environments, the services within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid
       compromises that allow attackers to pivot to the OT environment without detection.
   •   The security architecture diagram shows an IT authentication server in the enterprise
       network to authenticate users and a separate OT authentication server in the operations
       management network for OT users. Organizations may want to consider this approach if
       it supports their risk-based security objectives.
For Layer 4 and Layer 5, organizations should consider applying the principle of least
functionality on all field, operations management, and DMZ devices to support application and
device hardening. Organizations should identify and disable any non-essential capability,
software, or ports on the devices. For example, a web server or SSH server may be available in
some newer PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be disabled, and the
associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled as well. Only enable the functionality when
required.

5.4.2. DCS- and PLC-Based OT with IIoT
Building on the guidance for DCS- and PLC-based OT environments in Section 5.4.1, Fig. 19
shows a simplified example security architecture implementation for the DCS system with
additional IIoT devices configured to utilize a local IIoT platform for providing computing
capabilities. Due to the different communication and architectural components that support IIoT,
the example shows separate network segments for supporting the additional IIoT components.
Communication from the IIoT platform tier is routed through the DMZ border firewall to allow


                                                86

September 2023

organizations to consider data transmission to servers in the DMZ or to the enterprise/internet as
required to support IIoT operational requirements. Additionally, this also permits the
cybersecurity services located in the DMZ to monitor the IIoT platform tier.




               Fig. 19. A security architecture example for DCS system with IIoT devices


5.4.3. SCADA-Based OT Environments
Figure 20 shows an example implementation of the components and general configuration of a
SCADA system. Typically, primary and backup control centers support one or more remote
stations based on geographic locations, and regional control centers are geographically located to
support one or more primary or backup control centers. Due to the distributed nature of the
remote stations and control centers, communication between locations typically passes over
external or WAN connections using wireless or wired mediums.

                      Fig. 20. An example SCADA system in an OT environment

Figure 21 shows an example defense-in-depth implementation for a SCADA system that
assumes that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 and Layer 2. For Layer 3, the
organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture:
   •   Separate networks into different zones or regions, which is important for applying a
       defense-in-depth strategy in a SCADA environment. Additional separation should be
       considered for security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors,
       gates, cameras, VoIP, access card readers).
   •   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added between the different regions to control and
       monitor communications between the network segments. Industrial-class stateful
       firewalls may offer more support for OT-specific protocols and enhance protection for
       OT devices, like the PLC and controllers. Rules for inbound and outbound
       communication should be defined so that only authorized communication passes between
       regions.
   •   Use secure connections (e.g., VPN tunnel, encrypted channel, point-to-point connection)
       between network segments, such as between a regional center and primary control
       centers and between remote stations and control centers. For geographically distanced
       locations, secure connections can be connected over the internet/WAN. Devices in the
       network segments should only connect to other segments through the secure connection
       and should be restricted when accessing the internet.

   •   Implement a DMZ to separate the control centers from the enterprise network. Any
       communications between the enterprise network and the control centers must go through
       services within the DMZ. Since the DMZ connects to outside environments, the services
       within the DMZ must be monitored and protected to avoid compromises within the DMZ
       that might allow attackers to pivot to the OT environment without detection.




                    Fig. 21. A security architecture example for a SCADA system

For Layer 4 and Layer 5, organizations should consider applying the principle of least
functionality to all remote station components, control center components, and DMZ devices to
support application and device hardening. Organizations should identify and disable any non-
essential capability, software, or ports on the devices. For example, a webserver or SSH server
may be available in some newer PLCs or HMIs. If these services are not used, they should be
disabled, and the associated TCP/UDP ports should be disabled. Only enable the functionality
when required.

   Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT
Many public and private-sector organizations have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
(CSF) [CSF] to guide cybersecurity activities and consider cybersecurity risks. The Framework
consists of five concurrent and continuous Functions – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and
Recover – for presenting industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for
the communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization. When
considered together, these Functions provide a high-level, strategic view for cybersecurity risk
management. The Framework further identifies underlying key Categories and Subcategories for
each Function and matches them with example Informative References, such as existing
standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.
The five Functions include 23 Categories of cybersecurity outcomes and Subcategories that
further divide the Categories into more specific technical or management activities. For this
section, each subsection references a CSF Function and Category and includes the CSF two-
letter abbreviations for reference.
                                            The CSF Functions guide the following actions:
                                            Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational
                                            understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to
                                            systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
                                            Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate
                                            safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
                                            Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate
                                            activities to identify the occurrence of the
                                            cybersecurity event.

                                            resilience and to restore any capabilities or services
                                            that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

This section discusses all CSF Functions and selected CSF Categories and Subcategories.
Additionally, some Categories include additional OT-specific considerations that are not
included in the CSF.

       Identify (ID)
The Identify Function provides foundational activities to effectively use the CSF. The intended
outcome of the Identify Function is to develop an organizational understanding to manage
cybersecurity risks to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.

6.1.1. Asset Management (ID.AM)
The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and manage data, personnel,
devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a foundational
capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, updating inventory
information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, new firmware
installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately manage their
overall environmental risks. Organizations should consider including the following to support
their asset management capability:
   •   Unique identifiers to differentiate and track assets
   •   Hardware inventory management to track computing and network devices within the
       environment, including device details and location. Device details may include vendor,
       model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g.,
       provenance information).
   •   Software and firmware inventory management to track the software and firmware
       installed with the OT components, including version numbers, location information, and
       software bill of materials (SBOM)
   •   Vendor information to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact,
       warranty information, locations of recall, and update information
   •   Documented roles and responsibilities to identify specific individuals, teams, or
       organization groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation,
       maintenance, and cybersecurity roles and responsibilities
Supplemental guidance for ID.AM can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management
   •   NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and
       Organizations
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the criticality of a complete and accurate
            asset inventory for managing risk within the OT environment. Accurate
            inventory information supports multiple risk management objectives,
            including risk assessment, vulnerability management, and obsolescence
            tracking.
            While automated tools for supporting asset management are generally
            preferable, organizations should consider how the tool collects
            information and whether the collection method (e.g., active scanning)
            may have a negative impact on their OT systems. Performing a test using
            the automated asset management tools on offline systems or components
            is recommended prior to deployment within the OT production
            environment. When automated tools are not feasible due to network
            architectures or other OT environment issues, the organization should
            consider manual processes for maintaining a current inventory.

September 2023

6.1.1.1.       Mapping Data Flows (ID.AM-3)
Data flow diagrams help a manufacturer understand the flow of data between networked
components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand the expected behavior
of their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting
as well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic
activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the impact of the use of automated data
            flow mapping tools that use active scanning or require network
            monitoring tools (e.g., in-line network probes) on OT systems. Impacts
            could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network
            traffic, or the momentary disconnection of manufacturing system
            components from the network. Consider using data flow mapping tools
            that utilize these methods during planned downtime.

6.1.1.2.     Network Architecture Documentation (Supports the Outcome of
       ID.AM)
Network architecture documentation tools help a manufacturer identify, document, and diagram
the interconnections between networked devices, corporate networks, and other external
connections. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnections within the environment is
critical for the successful deployment of cybersecurity controls. This information is equally
important for effective network monitoring.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Network architecture documentation tools that use automated topology
            discovery technologies can only capture details from IP-based networked
            devices. Many OT environments contain isolated systems, components,
            or systems connected on non-IP networks. The OT environment may not
            be technically capable of using automated network architecture
            documentation tools, and manual processes may be required to document
            these components.
            Asset owners may also want to consider how automated scanning
            activities may potentially impact the OT system by testing automation
            tools in a non-production environment. Based on testing results, asset
            owners should consider utilizing automated OT network architecture
            documentation tools during planned downtime.
            Organizations may also want to consider physically inspecting OT
            network connections or analyzing network logs to document the OT
            network architecture, especially if the network is not large or
            complicated. Incorporating OT network activity monitoring may help
            organizations identify the addition or removal of devices within the
            environment between planned scanning activities.

September 2023

6.1.2. Governance (ID.GV)
Effective governance involves organizational leadership incorporating risk management
objectives into the strategic planning process along with resiliency, privacy, and cybersecurity
objectives, as well as providing the required resources to effectively implement and sustain the
cybersecurity program. From this process, organizational leadership develops and disseminates
policies that establish security requirements for their environments. These policies may include
the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and
compliance. The policies may also reflect coordination among the organizational entities
responsible for the different aspects of security (e.g., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-
physical, access control, media protection, vulnerability management, maintenance, monitoring).
Sections 3 and 4 provide additional details for governance. Supplemental guidance for ID.GV
can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
       Information System View
   •   NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and
       Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy

   •   NIST IR 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider:
                   •   Ensuring that the cybersecurity program is given sufficient
                       resources to support the organization’s IT and OT risk
                       management strategy
                   •   Ensuring that policies take the full life cycle of the OT systems
                       into consideration
                   •   Ensuring that legal and regulatory cybersecurity requirements
                       that affect OT operations are understood and managed
                   •   Establishing one or more senior official positions that are
                       responsible and accountable for the organization’s governance
                       and risk management for IT and OT cybersecurity programs
                   •   Establishing communication and coordination between IT and
                       OT organizations
                   •   Cross-training IT and OT personnel to support the cybersecurity
                       program

September 2023

6.1.3. Risk Assessment (ID.RA)
A cybersecurity risk assessment is performed to identify risks and estimate the magnitude of
harm to operations, assets, or individuals that might result from cyber incidents, such as
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of an information
system or data. Organizations should consider the frequency with which to update risk
assessments and test system cybersecurity controls.
Supplemental guidance for ID.RA can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
   •   NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and
       Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
   •   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
       Information System View
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            In OT environments, risks and impacts may be related to safety, health,
            and the environment, in addition to business and financial impacts. As a
            result, organizations may find that conducting a cost-benefit analysis for
            some types of risks is not possible. In these cases, organizations should
            consider reviewing past cyber and non-cyber incidents that have resulted
            in the loss of power, control, upstream feed, or downstream capacity, as
            well as major equipment failures. A PHA, FMEA, or analysis of past
            events can be used to understand the potential impact of a cyber incident.
            ISA 62443-3-2 provides guidance on how to assess cyber risk in an
            environment with these potential consequences.
            Risk assessments also require the identification of both vulnerabilities
            and threats to the OT environment. Maintaining an accurate inventory of
            the IT and OT assets within the environment of operation – including the
            product vendor, model numbers, firmware, OSs, and software versions
            installed on the assets – facilitates the identification, tracking, and
            remediation of vulnerabilities. OT-specific vulnerability information is
            available through multiple methods, including:
                   •   Using OT-specific tools to automate asset inventory creation,
                       cross-correlation of the inventory with known vulnerabilities and
                       threats, and regular updates
                   •   Monitoring security groups, associations, and vendors for
                       security alerts and advisories
                   •   Reviewing the NVD database for detailed information on known
                       vulnerabilities for hardware and software assets
            Threat information that is relevant to the environment can be obtained
            from both internal resources and external threat intelligence information-
            sharing forums. Organizations should consider participating in cyber
            threat information sharing [SP800-150].

September 2023

6.1.4. Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM)
The risk management strategy guides how risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored
and provides a consistent approach to making risk-based decisions across the organization. Risk
tolerance, assumptions, constraints, priorities, and trade-offs are identified for investment and
operational decision making. Additionally, the risk management strategy identifies acceptable
risk assessment methodologies, potential risk responses, and a process to continuously monitor
the security posture (or implementation of security countermeasures and outcomes) of the
organization.
Section 3 describes the overall risk management process for supporting an effective
cybersecurity program. The following NIST documents provide additional implementation
guidance for developing a risk management strategy:
   •   NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and
       Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
   •   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
       Information System View
   •   NIST IR 8179, Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing Systems and Components
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When establishing an OT risk management strategy, organizations
            should consider:
                   •   Ensuring that the risk tolerance of an OT environment is
                       informed by the organization’s role in critical infrastructure and
                       sector-specific risk analysis
                   •   Documenting failure scenarios that involve IT components within
                       the OT environment and their effect on operations and safety
                   •   Establishing processes to periodically update information to
                       determine the current risk posture for the environment and
                       coordinate required adjustments to risk management and
                       management controls
            Overall risk can also be reduced by addressing likelihood and
            consequence. For OT systems, the risk management strategy should
            consider non-security and safety controls (e.g., pressure relief valves,
            manual valves) that can also help reduce the consequence of a failure.

6.1.5. Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC)
Supply chains are multifaceted and built on a variety of business, economic, and technological
factors. Organizations choose their suppliers, and consumers choose their sources based on a
range of factors that vary from corporate preferences and existing business relationships to more
discrete considerations, such as the existence of limited sources of supply or other unique
characteristics.



                                                    95

September 2023

The Subcategories (outcomes) that fall within the CSF Supply Chain Risk Management Category
provide the basis for developing processes and procedures for managing supply chain risk. These
risks include the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, malicious insiders,
tampering, theft, and the insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor
manufacturing and development practices in the cyber supply chain. These risks must be
identified, assessed, and managed. The CSF Category also addresses supplier and third-party
partner contracts, assessments, evaluations, and response and recovery planning.
Additionally, organizations should investigate SBOMs and distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain)
technologies to support supply chain risk management. For example, SBOM information can
identify software components and their relationships or dependencies on other components.
Having this information available can help an organization determine whether a device is
affected by reported software vulnerabilities.
Supplemental guidance for Supply Chain Risk Management can be found in the following
documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information
       Systems and Organizations
   •   NIST IR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations
       from Industry
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider documenting and tracking serial numbers,
            checksums, digital certificates/signatures, or other identifying features
            that can enable them to verify the authenticity of vendor-provided OT
            hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations should also consider
            whether OT is purchased directly from the original equipment
            manufacturer (OEM) or an authorized third-party distributor or reseller.
            Suppliers should be assessed or reviewed to ensure that they continue to
            follow best practices.
            Many OT components and devices utilize open-source libraries to
            support their functional capabilities. Organizations should identify the
            open-source dependencies for their OT components and establish
            monitoring for open-source information, such as vendor websites or
            cyber news sources, to ensure that no known vulnerabilities or
            counterfeits have been disclosed. Additionally, organizations might
            consider utilizing an industry-recognized certification process for OT
            products to support supply chain risk management.

       Protect (PR)
The Protect Function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential
cybersecurity event. Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include: Identity
Management and Access Control; Awareness and Training; Data Security; Information
Protection Processes and Procedures; Maintenance; and Protective Technology

6.2.1. Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC)
Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and
managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity
management supports the cybersecurity principle of positively and uniquely identifying and
authorizing a person, process, or device before granting physical or logical access to resources
such as the system, information, or location being protected. Access controls represent the
policies, processes, and technologies for specifying the use of system resources by only
authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems. PR.AC controls allow organizations to
manage logical and physical access to support system risk management requirements.
Supplemental guidance for implementing identity management and access control outcomes can
be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines
   •   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the life cycle for managing OT
            credentials, including issuance, revocation, and updates across the OT
            environment.
            Organizations should also consider the centralization of identification
            and authentication for users, devices, and processes within the OT
            environments to improve account management and monitoring
            capabilities. Common network technologies – such as Active Directory,
            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and similar
            technologies – can be utilized to support the centralization of identity
            management across environments. Organizations should weigh the
            increased risks of authenticated accounts from IT environments having
            access within the OT environment against the benefits of using
            centralized accounts.
            When OT cannot support authentication or the organization determines
            that it is not advisable due to adverse impacts on performance, safety, or
            reliability, the organization should select compensating countermeasures,
            such as the use of physical security (e.g., control center keycard access
            for authorized users) to provide an equivalent security capability or level
            of protection for the OT. This guidance also applies to the use of session
            lock and session termination in an OT.
            A unique challenge in OT is the need for immediate access to an HMI in
            emergency situations. The time needed to enter a user’s credentials may
            impede response or intervention by the operator, resulting in negative
            consequences to safety, health, or the environment.

September 2023

6.2.1.1.       Logical Access Controls (PR.AC)
Logical access controls restrict logical access to an organization’s systems, data, and networks.
ACLs are sometimes used to support logical access controls. An ACL is a list of one or more
rules for determining whether an access request should be granted or denied, and it is used to
support the principle of least functionality and control access to restricted areas. ACLs are
commonly used with isolation technologies, such as firewalls, where an ACL might specify the
source, destination, and protocol allowed through the isolation device to or from the protected
network segment. ACLs may also be used for physical or logical access to areas or information,
such as network file shares, databases, or other data repositories and applications.
Role-based access control (RBAC) also supports logical access controls. RBAC is a technology
that has the potential to reduce the complexity and cost of security administration in networks
with large numbers of intelligent devices. RBAC is built on the principle that employees change
roles and responsibilities more frequently than the duties within those roles and responsibilities.
Under RBAC, security administration is simplified using roles, hierarchies, and constraints to
organize user access levels.
Additionally, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control approach in which
access is determined based on the attributes associated with subjects (requesters) and the objects
being accessed. Each object and subject has a set of associated attributes, such as location, time
of creation, and access rights. Access to an object is authorized or denied depending on whether
the required (e.g., policy-defined) correlation can be made between the attributes of that object
and the requesting subject.
For federal employees and contractors, Personal Identity Verification (PIV), used in accordance
with FIPS 201, may be required to achieve access control. Organizations may also consider one
or more of these techniques when determining how to support local access controls within their
environments. Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following
documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines
   •   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification
   •   NIST SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification

                   •   Some logical access controls, such as RBAC, support the
                       principle of least privilege and the separation of duties by

                       providing a uniform means to manage access to OT devices while
                       reducing the cost of maintaining individual device access levels
                       and minimizing errors. These logical access controls can also
                       restrict OT user privileges to only those required to perform each
                       person’s job (i.e., configuring each role based on the principle of
                       least privilege). The level of access can take several forms,
                       including viewing, using, and altering specific OT data or device
                       functions.
                   •   Solutions that provide credential management, authentication,
                       authorization, and system use monitoring technical capabilities.
                       These technologies may help manage risks associated with OT
                       devices and protocols by providing a secure platform to allow
                       authorized personnel to access the OT devices.
                   •   Access control systems that verify the identity of the individual,
                       process, or device before granting access to minimize latency or
                       delays in processing OT system access or commands.
                   •   Highly reliable systems that do not interfere with the routine or
                       emergency duties of OT personnel. Solutions should be designed
                       to reduce the impact of determining identity and authorization on
                       OT operations and safety.
To support access controls, an organization is not limited to a single access control approach. In
some cases, applying different access control techniques to different zones based on criticality,
safety, and operational requirements is more efficient and effective. For example, ACLs on
network zone firewalls combined with RBAC on engineering workstations and servers and
ABAC integrated into physical security to sensitive areas may achieve the risk-based access
control requirements of an organization.

6.2.1.2.       Physical Access Controls (PR.AC-2)
Physical security controls are physical measures that limit physical access to assets to prevent
undesirable effects, including unauthorized physical access to sensitive locations; the
unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, communications interfaces, or
removable media; and unauthorized disruption of the physical process. Physical access controls
include controls for managing and monitoring physical access, maintaining logs, and handling
visitors.
The deployment of physical security controls is often subject to specific environmental, safety,
regulatory, legal, and other requirements that must be identified and addressed for a given
environment. Physical security controls may be broadly applied or specific to certain assets.
The initial layers of physical access control are often determined based on the risk of access to
the overall facility, not just OT components. Some regulations, such as NERC CIP-006-5
(Physical Security of BES Cyber Systems) or from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),
may also determine the strength and quantity of barriers used for the physical protection of a
facility.

September 2023

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The physical protection of the cyber components and data associated
            with OT must be addressed as part of the overall security for OT
            environments. Security at many OT facilities is closely tied to
            operational safety. A primary goal is to keep personnel out of hazardous
            situations without preventing them from doing their jobs or carrying out
            emergency procedures.
            Physical access controls are often applied to the OT environment as
            compensating controls when legacy systems do not support modern IT
            logical access controls (e.g., an asset could be locked in a cabinet when
            the USB port or power button cannot be logically disabled). When
            implementing these mitigations, organizations should consider whether
            the OT component being protected can be compromised using a wireless
            or network connection that might bypass the physical security controls.
            A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the
            following attributes:
                   •   Protection of physical locations. Classic physical security
                       considerations typically include an architecture of layered
                       security measures that create several physical barriers around
                       buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational
                       assets. Physical security controls should be implemented to
                       protect physical locations and may include fences, anti-vehicle
                       ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door
                       and cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.
                   •   Physical access control. Equipment cabinets should be locked
                       when not required for operation or safety, and wiring should be
                       neat and contained within cabinets or under floors. Additionally,
                       consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in
                       secured areas. Keys of OT assets, like PLCs and safety systems,
                       should be in the “Run” position at all times unless they are being
                       actively programmed.
                   •   Access monitoring systems. Access monitoring systems include
                       electronic surveillance capabilities, such as still and video
                       cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge readers,
                       biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically
                       do not prevent access to a particular location. Rather, they store
                       and record either the physical presence or the lack of physical
                       presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical
                       entities. Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type
                       of access monitoring device deployed. These systems can also
                       sometimes alert or initiate action upon the detection of
                       unauthorized access.
                   •   People and asset tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a
                       facility can be important for both safety and security reasons.

NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

                       Asset location technologies can be used to track the movements
                       of people and vehicles to ensure that they stay in authorized
                       areas, to identify personnel who may need assistance, and to
                       support emergency response.
            The following are additional physical security considerations:
                   •   Portable devices. Organizations should apply a verification
                       process that includes, at a minimum, scanning devices (e.g.,
                       laptops, USB storage, etc.) for malicious code prior to allowing
                       the device to connect to OT devices or networks.
                   •   Cabling. While unshielded twisted pair communications cables
                       may be acceptable in an office environment, they may not be
                       suitable for some OT environments due to their susceptibility to
                       interference from magnetic fields, radio waves, temperature
                       extremes, moisture, dust, and vibration. Organizations should
                       consider using alternative cabling or shielding that provides
                       suitable protection against environmental threats. Additionally,
                       organizations should consider color-coded cables, connectors,
                       conduits, and labeling to clearly delineate OT and IT network
                       segments and reduce the risk of potential cross-connections.
                   •   Control centers and control rooms. Providing physical security
                       for control centers and control rooms can reduce the potential of
                       many threats, including unauthorized access. Access to these
                       areas should be limited to authorized personnel due to the
                       increased probability of finding sensitive servers, network
                       components, control systems, and consoles that support
                       continuous monitoring and rapid response. Gaining physical
                       access to a control room or OT system components often implies
                       gaining logical access to the system or system components. In
                       extreme cases, organizations may need to consider designing
                       control centers to be blast-proof or provide an off-site emergency
                       control center so that control can be maintained if the primary
                       control center becomes uninhabitable.

6.2.1.3.       Network Segmentation and Isolation (PR.AC-5)
As discussed in Section 5, a common architecture for supporting a defense-in-depth
cybersecurity approach involves the use of network segmentation or zoning to organize devices
by location or function. Network segmentation is typically implemented physically using
different network switches or logically using virtual local area network (VLAN) configurations.
When properly configured, network segmentation helps enforce security policies and segmented
traffic at the Ethernet layer and facilitates network isolation.
For network isolation, organizations typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required
communications between segments. Network isolation devices, such as gateways (including
unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) and firewalls, are then configured to enforce these
communication restrictions by monitoring all communication traffic and only permitting
explicitly authorized communication between segments.
Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-41, Rev. 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy
   •   NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture
   •   NIST SP 1800-15, Securing Small-Business and Home Internet of Things (IoT) Devices:
       Mitigating Network-Based Attacks Using Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The use of network segmentation and isolation should support an
            organization’s OT cybersecurity defense-in-depth architecture, as
            described in Section 5.
            While VLANs can be a cost-effective solution for OT network
            segmentation, organizations should consider utilizing physically separate
            switches for segmenting high-criticality devices, such as those that
            support safety systems.
            When configuring network isolation devices, organizations may find it
            difficult to determine which network traffic is necessary for proper OT
            operations. In these situations, organizations might consider temporarily
            allowing and recording all communication between the network
            segments. This can provide reviewable logs to identify and document
            authorized communication for implementing network isolation rules.
            This activity may also reveal previously unknown or undocumented
            communication that needs to be reviewed by the organization.
            Organizations should also consider whether regulatory requirements
            stipulate the type of network isolation devices required for OT
            environments or specific network segments. If organizations choose to
            utilize firewalls to support network isolation, modern firewalls should be
            considered, such as stateful and deep packet inspection devices and
            devices specifically designed to support OT environments. Organizations
            should enforce a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy where possible
            and also review the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure’s

             Good Practice Guide to assist with their firewall implementations.
             Network isolation devices may not protect against all network-based
             risks. For example, network isolation does not mitigate risks associated
             with lateral movement within a network segment, such as the
             propagation of a worm or other malicious code. Additionally, some IT
             protocols and many industrial communications protocols have known
             security vulnerabilities that might be exploitable through network
             isolation devices. Organizations should consider limiting the flow of
             insecure protocols, restricting information flow to be unidirectional, and
             utilizing secure and authenticated protocols for supporting information
             exchange between the OT environment and other network segments.

6.2.1.4.        User, Device, and Asset Authentication (PR.AC-7)
Various authentication methods can be implemented within OT environments, including, but not
limited to the methods discussed in this section.

6.2.1.4.1.         Physical Token Authentication
Physical token authentication primarily addresses the easy duplication of a secret code or sharing
it with others (e.g., a password to a “secure” system being written on the wall next to a PC or
operator station). With physical token authentication, the security token cannot be duplicated
without special access to equipment and supplies.
A second benefit is that the secret within a physical token can be very large, physically secure,
and randomly generated. Because it is embedded in metal or silicon, it does not have the same
risks that manually entered passwords do. Traditional passwords can become lost or stolen
without notice, leaving credentials more vulnerable to exploitation. If a security token is lost or
stolen, the token owner is aware of the missing token and can notify security personnel to disable
access.
Common forms of physical or token authentication include:
   •   Traditional physical locks and keys
   •   Security cards (e.g., magnetic, smart chip, optical coding)
   •   Radio frequency devices in the form of cards, key fobs, or mounted tags
   •   Dongles with secure encryption keys that attach to the USB, serial, or parallel ports of
       computers
   •   One-time authentication code generators (e.g., key fobs)
For single-factor authentication with a physical token, the greatest weakness is that physically
holding the token means access is granted (e.g., anyone who finds a set of lost keys can now
access whatever those keys open). Physical token authentication is more secure when combined
with a second form of authentication, such as a memorized PIN used alongside the token.



                                                 103

September 2023

When token-based access control employs cryptographic verification, the access control system
should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-78-4 [SP800-78-4].

6.2.1.4.2.     Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication enhances software-only solutions, such as password authentication, by
offering an additional authentication factor and removing the need for people to memorize
complex secrets. In addition, because biometric characteristics are unique to a given individual,
biometric authentication addresses the issues of lost or stolen physical tokens and smart cards.
Biometric devices make a useful secondary check versus other forms of authentication that can
become lost or borrowed. Using biometric authentication in combination with token-based
access control or badge-operated employee time clocks increases security.
Noted issues with biometric authentication include:
   •   Distinguishing a real object from a fake one (e.g., distinguishing a real human finger
       from a silicon rubber cast of one or a real human voice from a recorded one)
   •   Generating type-I and type-II errors, which is the probability of rejecting a valid
       biometric image and accepting an invalid biometric image, respectively. Biometric
       authentication devices should be configured to the lowest crossover between these two
       probabilities, also known as the crossover error rate.
   •   Handling environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, to which some
       biometric devices are sensitive
   •   Addressing industrial applications where employees may have to wear safety glasses
       and/or gloves and industrial chemicals are present
   •   Retraining biometric scanners that occasionally “drift” over time. Human biometric traits
       may also shift over time, necessitating periodic scanner retraining.
   •   Requiring face-to-face technical support and verification for device training, unlike a
       password that can be given over a phone or an access card that can be handed out by a
       receptionist
   •   Denying needed access to the OT system because of a temporary inability of the sensing
       device to acknowledge a legitimate user
   •   Being socially acceptable. Users consider some biometric authentication devices more
       acceptable than others. For example, retinal scans may be considered very low on the
       scale of acceptability, while thumbprint scanners may be considered high on the scale of
       acceptability. Users of biometric authentication devices will need to take social
       acceptability for their target group into consideration when selecting among biometric
       authentication technologies.
When token-based access control employs biometric verification, the access control system
should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-76-2 [SP800-76-2].
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             While biometrics can provide a valuable authentication mechanism,
             organizations may need to carefully assess the technology for use with


                                               104
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

             industrial applications. Physical and environmental issues within OT
             environments may decrease the reliability of biometric authorized
             authentication. Organizations may need to coordinate with system
             vendors or manufacturers regarding their specific physical and
             environmental properties and biometric authentication requirements.

6.2.1.4.3.      Smart Card Authentication
Smart cards come in a variety of form factors, from USB devices to embedded chips on cards the
size of credit cards that can be printed and embossed. Smart cards can be customized,
individualized, and issued in-house or outsourced to service providers who manufacture
hundreds or thousands per day. Smart cards enhance software-only solutions, such as password
authentication, by offering an additional authentication factor and removing the human element
in memorizing complex secrets by:
   •   Isolating security-critical computations that involve authentication, digital signatures, and
       key exchange from other parts of the system that do not have a need to know
   •   Enabling the portability of credentials and other private information between computer
       systems
   •   Providing tamper-resistant storage for protecting private keys and other forms of personal
       information
Most issues regarding the use of smart cards are logistical and focus on issuing cards,
particularly replacing lost or stolen cards.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Although smart cards offer useful functionality, their implementation in
             OT must consider the overall security context of the OT environment.
             The necessary identification of individuals, issuance of cards, revocation
             if compromise is suspected, and the assignment of authorizations to
             authenticated identities represents a significant initial and ongoing
             challenge. In some cases, corporate IT or other resources may be
             available to assist in the deployment of smart cards and the required
             public key infrastructures. Organizations should also consider the impact
             on OT operational capabilities if dependency on IT systems and services
             are required to support the smart card technology.
             Additionally, if smart cards are implemented in an OT setting,
             organizations should consider provisions for managing lost or damaged
             cards, the costs to incorporate and sustain a respective access control
             system, and a management process for card distribution and retrieval.
             These procedures should consider the ability to grant temporary access to
             OT personnel to prevent operational or safety disruptions.
             A common approach in the Federal Government is based on the
             standardization on Federal PIV smart cards, which allows organizations
             to use the same credential mechanism in multiple applications with one
             to three factors for authentication (i.e., Card-Only, Card+PIN,


                                                105

September 2023

             Card+PIN+Biometric), depending on the risk level of the protected
             resource. If the Federal PIV is used as an identification token, the access
             control system should conform to the requirements of FIPS 201
             [FIPS201] and NIST SP 800-73-4 [SP800-73-4] and employ either
             cryptographic verification or biometric verification.

6.2.1.4.4.      Multi-Factor Authentication
There are several possible factors for determining the authenticity of a person, device, or system,
including something you know (e.g., PIN number or password), something you have (e.g., key,
dongle, smart card), and something you are (i.e., a biological characteristic, such as a fingerprint
or retinal signature). When two or more factors are used, the process is known as multi-factor
authentication (MFA). In general, the more factors that are used in the authentication process, the
more robust the process.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations need to consider whether MFA is required for protecting
             OT environments in whole or in part. MFA is an accepted best practice
             for remote access to OT applications. When determining the placement
             and usage of MFA within an OT environment, organizations may need to
             consider different authentication scenarios since some OT components
             support only a single factor or no authentication. Organizations may
             consider adjusting credential requirements based on the type of access or
             other mitigating factors for the environment. For example, remote access
             to the OT environment may require MFA, while local access may only
             require a user ID and password due to other mitigating factors, such as
             physical access controls before gaining physical access to the area where
             the user ID and password may be used.

6.2.1.4.5.      Password Authentication
While password authentication schemes are arguably the most common and simplest form of
authentication, numerous vulnerabilities are associated with the use of and reliance on password-
only authentication. For example, systems are often delivered with default passwords that can be
easily guessed, discovered, or researched. Another weakness is the ease of third-party
eavesdropping. Passwords typed at a keyboard can be visually observed by others or recorded
using keystroke loggers.
Some network services and protocols transmit passwords as plaintext (unencrypted), allowing
any network capture tool to expose the passwords. Additionally, passwords may be shared and
not changed frequently. The use of shared credentials, including shared passwords, limits the
ability to positively identify the individual person, process, or device that accessed a protected
resource. Defense in depth is often utilized to prevent password authentication from being the
only control in place to prevent unauthorized modification.

NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Many OT systems do not offer password recovery mechanisms, so the
            secure and reliable handling of passwords is critical to maintaining
            continuous operation. Organizations are encouraged to change the
            default password on OT equipment to make it more difficult for an
            adversary to guess the password. Once changed, the password needs to
            be made available to those who need to know. Organizations may want
            to consider using a password management tool that is secure and
            accessible by those who need to know.
            Some OT OSs make setting secure passwords difficult if the password
            size is smaller than current password standards and the system allows
            only group passwords at each level of access rather than individual
            passwords. Some industrial (and internet) protocols transmit passwords
            in plaintext, making them susceptible to interception. In cases where this
            practice cannot be avoided, it is important that users have different (and
            unrelated) passwords for use with encrypted and non-encrypted
            protocols.
            Additionally, special considerations may be required when applying
            policies based on login password authentication within the OT
            environment. Without an exclusion list based on machine identification
            (ID), non-operator login can result in policies such as auto-logoff
            timeout and administrator password replacement being pushed down,
            which can be detrimental to the operation of the OT system.
            The following are general recommendations and considerations with
            regard to the use of passwords:
                   •   Change all default passwords in OT components.
                   •   Passwords should have appropriate length, strength, and
                       complexity balanced with security and operational ease of access
                       within the capabilities of the software and underlying OS.
                   •   Passwords should not be able to be found in a dictionary or
                       contain predictable sequences of numbers or letters.
                   •   Passwords should be used with care on specialized OT devices,
                       such as control consoles on critical processes. Using passwords
                       on these consoles could introduce potential safety issues if
                       operators are locked out or access is delayed during critical
                       events. Organizations should consider physical or network
                       isolation for devices where password protection is not
                       recommended.
                   •   Copies of shared or administrator passwords must be stored in a
                       secure location with limited access that can also be accessed in an
                       emergency. Organizations may also need to consider procedures
                       to periodically change passwords when a password is


                                                   107

                       compromised or an individual with access leaves the
                       organization.
                   •   Privileged (administrative) account passwords require additional
                       protection, such as stronger password requirements, more
                       frequent changing, and additional physical safeguards.
                   •   Passwords should not be sent across any network unless they are
                       protected by some form of FIPS-approved encryption or salted
                       cryptographic hash that is specifically designed to prevent replay
                       attacks.

6.2.2. Awareness and Training (PR.AT)
The Awareness and Training category provides policies and procedures for ensuring that all
users are given basic cybersecurity awareness and training.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training
       Program
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
   •   NIST SP 800-181, Rev. 1, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Personnel should receive security awareness and training for the OT
            environment and specific applications. In addition, organizations should
            identify, document, and train all personnel who have significant OT roles
            and responsibilities. Awareness and training should cover the physical
            process being controlled as well as the OT system.
            Security awareness is a critical part of OT incident prevention,
            particularly when it comes to social engineering threats. Social
            engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals into giving
            away private information, such as passwords. This information can then
            be used to compromise otherwise secure systems.
            OT security-specific awareness and training programs could include a
            basic understanding of social engineering techniques, how to identify
            anomalous behavior in the OT environment, when and how to connect
            and disconnect the OT environment from external security domains,
            password complexity and management requirements, and reporting
            practices. All personnel with OT responsibilities should be provided with
            training, which may be tailored based on roles and responsibilities. Roles
            to consider in the training program could include senior executives,
            privileged account users, third-party providers, physical security
            personnel, control engineers, operators, and maintainers.

September 2023

6.2.3. Data Security (PR.DS)
Providing data security includes protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
at rest and data in transit, protecting assets after removal, and preventing data leaks.
Cryptography can support data security requirements. Encryption, digital signatures, hashing,
and other cryptographic functions are available to prevent unauthorized access or the
modification of data at rest and in transit [RFC4949]. When cryptography is selected,
organizations should use a certified cryptographic system. Federal organizations are required to
comply with FIPS 140-3 [FIPS140-3] and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program
(CMVP). Additionally, cryptographic hardware should be protected from physical tampering and
uncontrolled electronic connections.
Supplemental guidance for data security can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-47, Rev. 1, Managing the Security of Information Exchanges
   •   NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Identify critical physical and electronic file types and data to protect
            while at rest. This may include personally identifiable information and
            sensitive, proprietary, or trade secret information (e.g., PLC program
            code, robot programs, computer-aided drafting [CAD] or computer-aided
            manufacturing [CAM] files, operating manuals and documentation,
            electrical diagrams, network diagrams, historical production data
            [IR8183A]). Organizations should consider centralizing critical data
            within secure storage locations.
            When OT data is stored in the cloud or on vendor servers, organizations
            should consider performing a risk analysis to determine how the data is
            protected by the service provider and whether additional
            countermeasures should be implemented to manage risk to an acceptable
            level.
            Monitor information flows from the OT security domain to other security
            domains and connections between security domains. Technologies such
            as data diodes, firewalls, and ACLs can be used to restrict the
            information flow. Examples of critical interfaces and interconnections
            may include interfaces between IT and OT, OT and external industry
            partners, or OT and third-party support vendors.
            To protect data on system components at end of life, an asset disposal
            program should be implemented, including considerations for wiping,
            sanitizing, or otherwise destroying critical data and media prior to
            disposal. The asset disposal program should include any removeable
            media, mobile devices, and traditional OT hardware.




                                                 109
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Cryptography
            Critical OT data should be protected while in transit, especially over
            third-party network segments and other untrusted or vulnerable network
            paths (e.g., cellular, wireless, internet, WAN). Identify critical data, and
            implement cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., encryption) to prevent
            unauthorized access or the modification of system data and audit records.
            Encryption provides a mechanism for ensuring confidentiality and
            integrity for data in transit.
            OT applications often focus on the availability of data. Before deploying
            encryption in OT, ensure that confidentiality or integrity is the goal of
            applying the security control. The use of encryption within an OT
            environment could introduce communications latency due to the
            additional time and computing resources required to encrypt, decrypt,
            and authenticate each message. Encryption may also cause performance
            degradation of the end device or system. Before deploying encryption
            within an OT environment, solutions should be tested to determine
            whether latency is acceptable for the application. Encryption at OSI
            Layer 2 rather than Layer 3 may be implemented to help reduce
            encryption latency.
            Additionally, while encryption provides confidentiality between
            encryption and decryption devices, anomaly detection tools that support
            OT environments may be unable to read encrypted data. Encryption
            should, therefore, be carefully planned and implemented to manage
            operational risks.
            Organizations should also consider that cryptography may introduce key
            management issues. Sound security policies require key management
            processes that can become more difficult as the geographic size of the
            OT increases. Because site visits to change or manage keys can be costly
            and slow, organizations should consider whether cryptographic
            protection with remote key management may be beneficial, such as when
            the protected units become so numerous or geographically dispersed that
            managing keys is difficult or expensive.
            For OT, encryption can be deployed as part of a comprehensive,
            enforced security policy. A cryptographic key should be long enough so
            that guessing it or determining it through analysis takes more effort,
            time, and cost than the value of the protected asset.

6.2.4. Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP)
Policies, processes, and procedures should be maintained and used to manage the protection of
information systems and assets. Countermeasures and outcomes should be in place to manage
configuration changes throughout the life cycle of the component and system. Backups should be
maintained, and response and recovery plans should be prepared and tested. A plan should be



                                                110

developed and implemented for vulnerability management throughout the life cycle of the
components.

6.2.4.1.       Least Functionality (PR.IP-1)
The principle of least functionality involves configuring systems to only provide essential
functions and services. Some default functions and services may not be necessary to support
essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. These functions include network ports
and protocols, software, and services.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Systems and devices in the OT environment include many functions and
            services that are unnecessary for their proper operation, some of which
            may be enabled by default and without the organization’s knowledge.
            Any functions or services that are not required for proper operation
            should be disabled to reduce exposure.
            Care should be taken when disabling these functions and services, as
            unintended impacts may result if a critical function or service is
            unknowingly disabled (e.g., disabling all external communications to a
            PLC may also disable the ability to communicate with associated HMIs).
            Devices should be subjected to extensive testing before being deployed
            on the OT network.

6.2.4.2.       Configuration Change Control (Configuration Management) (PR.IP-3)
Configuration management helps ensure that systems are deployed and maintained in a secure
and consistent state to reduce risks from outages due to configuration issues and security
breaches through improved visibility and tracking of changes to the system. In addition,
configuration management can detect improper configurations before they negatively impact
performance, safety, or security. Configuration management tools enable an asset owner to
establish and maintain the integrity of system hardware and software components by controlling
the processes for initializing, changing, monitoring, and auditing the configurations of the
components throughout the system life cycle.
Supplemental guidance for configuration management can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of
       Information Systems
   •   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should document the approved baseline configuration for
            their OT devices and establish the system development life cycle



                                               111
NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            (SDLC) approach to document, test, and approve changes before
            deploying them to the OT environment.
            Some organizations may maintain logbooks or other similar methods to
            document changes to OT components. Organizations should consider
            centralizing the tracking and documentation of changes to the OT
            environment to improve visibility and ensure proper testing and
            approvals for system changes. Such a process may help organizations to
            prevent accidental reconfiguration or identify the intentional
            reconfiguration of components to unapproved or untested versions.
            If the use of automated configuration management tools are deemed to
            be appropriate, processes should be in place to validate configurations
            prior to deployment. Many changes to OT can be made only during
            scheduled maintenance downtimes to minimize impacts. When
            considering automated configuration management tools, organizations
            should also consider potential impacts to the OT system. In some cases,
            these tools transfer numerous types and potentially large amounts of data
            over the manufacturing system network. Additionally, some tools may
            also have the potential to impact OT system operations by attempting to
            change device configurations or manipulating active files.

6.2.4.3.       Backups (PR.IP-4)
Conducting, maintaining, and testing backups is a critical outcome for the recovery process if a
cyber or reliability incident occurs.
Supplemental guidance for determining the priority and strategy for backups can be found in the
following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-34, Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A list of all maintained backups should be developed, including
            installation media, license keys, and configuration information.
            Additional measures should be taken to ensure that backups are readily
            available when needed, such as:
                   •   Verify the backups for reliability and integrity (if technically
                       possible).
                   •   Establish an on-site location for backups that is accessible to all
                       personnel who may need access during a recovery event.
                   •   Establish an alternate secondary storage location for additional
                       copies of backups to ensure that the same incident that disrupts
                       the primary data cannot modify or destroy the backup (e.g., store
                       PLC logic and configuration files at an off-site, geographically



                                                    112

September 2023

                       diverse location that cannot be destroyed by the same [hurricane,
                       wildfire, tornado] that may destroy the PLC).
                   •   Test the restoration process from backup data as part of
                       contingency plan testing.
                   •   Ensure that backup procedures are included in configuration or
                       change management processes.
                   •   Secure backups according to access control requirements.
                   •   Monitor environmental conditions where backup media is stored.

6.2.4.4.       Physical Operating Environment (PR.IP-5)
Managing the physical operating environment includes emergency protection controls, such as
emergency shutdown of the system, backup for power and lighting, controls for temperature and
humidity, and protection against fire and water damage. Organizations should develop policies
and procedures to ensure that environmental operating requirements for assets are achieved.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the following factors when identifying
            potential countermeasures to protect the physical operating environment:
                   •   Environmental factors. Environmental factors can be important.
                       For example, if a site is dusty, systems should be placed in a
                       filtered environment, especially if the dust is likely to be
                       conductive or magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal or
                       iron. If vibration is likely to be a problem, systems should be
                       mounted on rubber bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring
                       connection problems. In addition, environments that contain
                       systems and media (e.g., backup tapes, floppy disks) should have
                       stable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the OT system
                       should be generated when environmental specifications, such as
                       temperature or humidity, are exceeded.
                   •   Environmental control systems. HVAC systems for control
                       rooms must support OT personnel during normal operation and
                       emergency situations, which could include the release of toxic
                       substances. Risk assessments should consider the risk of
                       operating an HVAC system (e.g., air intakes) in an occupied
                       shelter during a toxic release, as well as continued operation
                       during a power outage (e.g., using an uninterruptible power
                       supply in critical environments). Additionally, fire systems must
                       be carefully designed to avoid causing more harm than good
                       (e.g., to avoid mixing water with incompatible products). HVAC
                       and fire systems have significant roles that arise from the
                       interdependence of process control and security. For example,
                       fire prevention and HVAC systems that support industrial control
                       computers need to be protected against cyber incidents.

                   •   Power. Reliable power for OT is essential, so a UPS should be
                       provided for critical systems. If the site has an emergency
                       generator, the UPS battery life may only need to last for a few
                       seconds. However, if the site relies on external power, the UPS
                       battery life may need to last for hours. At a minimum, it should
                       be sized so that the system can be shut down safely.

6.2.4.5.     Response and Recovery Plans (PR.IP-9) and Response and Recovery
       Plan Testing (PR.IP-10)
Organizations should develop and maintain response plans, including incident response and
business continuity. Response plans should be measured against the service being provided, not
just the system that was compromised. Organizations should consider a systematic approach to
response planning, such as the process described in CISA’s Cybersecurity Incident and
Vulnerability Response Playbooks [CISA-CIVR]. Common planning steps include preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, recovery, post-incident activity, communication, and
coordination. Organizations should also regularly review and update their response plans.
The response plans should be documented in paper form or on an offline system (i.e., air gapped)
that cannot be compromised during a cyber attack. Individuals should be trained on where to find
the response plan and the actions to take as part of an incident response. Additionally, during the
preparation of the incident response plan, input should be obtained from the various
stakeholders, including operations, engineering, IT, system support vendors, management,
organized labor, legal, and safety. These stakeholders should also review and approve the plan.
Business continuity planning addresses the overall issue of maintaining or reestablishing
production in the case of an interruption. An outage can take days, weeks, or months to recover
from a natural disaster or minutes or hours to recover from a malware infection or a mechanical
or electrical failure. Business continuity plans (BCPs) are often written to cover many types of
incidents involving several different disciplines. The BCP for cybersecurity incidents should
broadly cover long-term outages, including disaster recovery, and short-term outages that require
operational recovery. It is important to work with physical security on developing the BCP
related to cybersecurity incidents. This collaboration with physical security should include the
identification of critical equipment and the associated countermeasures in place to prevent an
incident.
Before creating a BCP to address potential outages, it is important to specify the recovery
objectives for the various systems and subsystems involved based on typical business needs.
There are two distinct types of objectives: system recovery and data recovery. System recovery
involves the recovery of communication links and processing capabilities and is usually specified
in terms of a recovery time objective (RTO). Management should define the acceptable RTO,
and technical personnel should work to achieve that target. Data recovery involves the recovery
of data that describes production or product conditions in the past and is usually specified in
terms of a recovery point objective (RPO). This is defined as the time for which an absence of
data can be tolerated. The RTO and RPO may justify investment in spare inventory if recovery
objectives cannot be met by other means.
Once the recovery objectives are defined, a list of potential interruptions should be created, and
the recovery procedure should be developed and described. A contingency plan is then created


                                                  114
NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

for the variety of potential interruptions. The contingency plan should be reviewed with
managers to ensure that the cost to meet the contingency plan is approved. For many smaller-
scale interruptions, a critical spares inventory will likely prove adequate to meet the recovery
objectives. For larger-scale recovery, vendor relationships will likely be leveraged. For all types
of recovery, backups are critical.

A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures that comprise a
comprehensive statement of recovery actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster. The
DRP is ordinarily documented in both electronic and paper form to ensure that it is readily
available during any type of disaster (e.g., natural, environmental, or caused by humans, whether
intentionally or unintentionally). Organizations should develop, maintain, and validate disaster
recovery plans for their environments to help minimize an event impact by reducing the time
required to restore capabilities.
Organizations may already have some emergency response plans in place and should consider
leveraging existing plans when developing a response plan for cybersecurity events.
Supplemental guidance for response planning can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-34, Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems
   •   NIST SP 800-61, Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
   •   NIST SP 800-83, Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for
       Desktops and Laptops

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Incident response planning may include the following elements:
                   •   Identification and classification of incidents. The various types
                       of OT incidents should be identified and classified based on
                       potential impact so that a proper response can be formulated for
                       each potential incident.
                   •   Response actions. Incident response can range from doing
                       nothing to performing a full system shutdown, which could result
                       in a shutdown of the physical process. The response taken will
                       depend on the type of incident and its effect on the OT system
                       and the physical process being controlled. A written plan that
                       documents the response to each type of incident should be
                       prepared. This will provide guidance during times when there
                       might be confusion or stress due to the incident. This plan should
                       include step-by-step actions to be taken by various stakeholders.


                                                  115

September 2023

                   Reporting requirements should be documented along with contact
                   information and the reporting format to reduce confusion.
                   Response actions should also include steps for detection,
                   analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident
                   activity. Some considerations for OT may include:
                       o Determining a priority, such as returning to normal
                         operations as quickly as possible or performing an
                         investigation and preserving forensic data
                       o Communicating with the incident response team
                       o Disconnecting infected systems from the network
                       o Physically isolating operationally independent networks
                         (e.g., enterprise from control or control from safety)
                       o Transitioning to manual operations
                       o Resourcing for additional operations support to manually
                         validate data
                       o Notifying management, public relations, and/or outside
                         companies and agencies as required
            If an incident is discovered, organizations should conduct a focused risk
            assessment on the OT environment to evaluate the effects of the attack
            and the options to respond. For example, one possible response option is
            to physically isolate the system under attack. However, this may have a
            negative impact on the OT and may not be possible without impacting
            operational performance or safety. A focused risk assessment should be
            used to determine the response action.
            The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of
            components in the case of an emergency. If possible, replacements for
            hard-to-obtain critical components should be kept in inventory.
            The organization should have a means for prioritizing recovery
            activities. This prioritization may leverage existing documentation, such
            as risk assessments or startup procedures. For example, the focus may be
            to recover the systems that support critical utilities prior to the systems
            that support manufacturing based on the order of start-up activities.
            Testing recovery plan procedures for OT components may be difficult
            due to operational and safety requirements. Organizations may need to
            determine if “bench tests” or other offline testing is possible to confirm
            the recovery procedures for OT components. At a minimum,
            organizations should verify the integrity of the backups if a full recovery
            test cannot be performed.

6.2.5. Maintenance (PR.MA)
The outcomes that fall within the CSF Maintenance Category provide guidance for performing
routine and preventative maintenance on the components of an information system. This includes
the usage of local and remote maintenance tools and the management of maintenance personnel.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Maintenance tracking solutions enable an organization to schedule, track,
            authorize, monitor, and audit maintenance and repair activities to OT and
            ensure that maintenance logs or changes are properly documented.
            Documenting these events provides an audit trail that can aid in
            cybersecurity-related troubleshooting, response, and recovery activities.
            Maintenance tracking can also provide visibility into scheduled
            maintenance for OT devices and help inform end-of-life decisions.
            The software used for OT maintenance activities should be approved and
            controlled by the organization. Approved software should be obtained
            directly from vendors and its authenticity verified (e.g., by validating
            certificates or comparing the hashes of installers).
            Any maintenance performed on an OT device can inadvertently modify
            its configuration and result in an increased attack surface. The hardened
            state of the OT device should be maintained regardless of the
            maintenance performed. Device configuration should be verified after
            maintenance and software patching, as some features may have
            inadvertently been reenabled or new features installed. Best practices and
            other supporting documents should be obtained from the device vendor
            to guide and inform maintenance activities.
            Limiting the use of certain devices for maintenance activities can help
            reduce the chances of device compromise by exposure to external
            networks, unauthorized users, or theft. Maintenance devices that remain
            secure within the OT environment reduce their exposure. Using
            maintenance devices outside of the OT environment or connecting the
            devices to non-OT networks should be restricted or minimized.
            Any device connected to the OT system should be disconnected after the
            maintenance activities are completed, and any temporary connections
            should be removed.
            The operation, capabilities, and features of the devices used for
            maintenance activities should be well understood. Devices may contain
            wireless radios and other communications devices that may be
            vulnerable to side-channel attacks or may allow simultaneous
            connections between networks (i.e., dual-homed). Vendor documentation
            should be thoroughly reviewed to understand these capabilities.

6.2.6. Protective Technology (PR.PT)
Technical mechanisms assist organizations with protecting the devices and information within
their environments. These technologies alone may not be sufficient to sustain security
capabilities as threats evolve and change. As such, organizations should manage the technical
solutions that secure the organizational assets in a manner consistent with policies, procedures,
and agreements.

6.2.6.1.       Logging (PR.PT-1)
Logging enables an organization to capture events that occur within its systems and networks.
Events can be generated by many different systems, including OSs, workstations, servers,
networking devices, cybersecurity software, and applications.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Capturing log events is critical to maintaining situational awareness of
            the OT system. Typical events include maintenance functions (e.g.,
            access control, configuration changes, backup and restore), OS functions,
            and application (i.e., process) events. The specific types of events
            available for logging will vary between OT devices and should be
            chosen based on the capabilities of the device and the desired events to
            be captured.
            To support log correlation, each log entry should identify the device that
            generated the event, the timestamp of the event, and the user or system
            account that generated the event. In general, each log entry should also
            include where the event occurred, the type of event, when the event
            occurred, the source of the event, the identity of any users or system
            accounts related to the event, and the outcome of the event.
            Correlating events across multiple OT devices can be difficult if the
            event timestamps generated by the devices were not informed by a
            shared time source. The internal clocks of each device should be
            synchronized with a primary clock to support event correlation between
            devices. Log entries should also produce a consistent timestamp format
            (e.g., time zone format, string format, daylight saving).
            The collection and event forwarding functions may impact the
            performance of the OT device. Depending on the frequency of events
            being logged, the log size may grow quickly and result in increasing
            space utilization. Disk space and memory are limited on most OT
            devices, so adequate storage should be locally or remotely provided to
            reduce the likelihood of exceeding the device capacity, which could
            ultimately result in the loss of logging capability. Transferring logs from
            the OT devices to alternate storage should be considered.

6.2.7. Media Protection (PR.PT-2)
Removable media is protected, and use is restricted in accordance with policy. This includes
labeling media for distribution and handling requirements, as well as storage, transport,
sanitization, destruction, and disposal of the media.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation
   •   NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Processes and procedures for the handling of media assets should be
            developed and followed. Media assets include removable media and
            devices, such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, SD cards, and USB memory
            sticks, as well as printed reports and documents. Physical security
            controls should address specific requirements for the safe and secure
            maintenance of these assets and provide guidance for transporting,
            handling, and erasing or destroying these assets. Security requirements
            could include safe storage from loss, fire, theft, unintentional
            distribution, or environmental damage.
            OT devices should be protected against the misuse of media. The use of
            any unauthorized removable media or device on any node that is part of
            or connected to the OT should not be permitted. Solutions could be
            either procedural or technical to prevent the introduction of malware or
            the inadvertent loss or theft of data.
            Physically protecting media or encrypting the data on media is critical to
            protecting the OT environment. Gaining access to media that contains
            OT data could provide a malicious actor with valuable information for
            launching an attack.

6.2.8. Personnel Security
Cybersecurity should be included in human resources practices to reduce the risk of human error,
theft, fraud, or other intentional or unintentional misuse of information systems.
Supplemental guidance for the Personnel Security controls can be found in the following
documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-35, Guide to Information Technology Security Services
   •   NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification

September 2023

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A general personnel security program should address policy, position
            risk designations, personnel screening, terminations, transfers, access
            agreements, and third-party roles and responsibilities. OT personnel
            should communicate with human resources, IT, and physical security to
            ensure that personnel security requirements are being met.
            An organization should consider establishing an access agreement and
            request form for managing physical and/or logical access to OT
            equipment. Organizations should also screen the personnel assigned to
            critical positions who control and maintain the OT.
            Additionally, each employee should receive training that is relevant to
            and necessary for their job functions. Employees should demonstrate
            competence in their job functions to retain physical and logical access to
            OT. Organizations should consider adopting a framework, such as the
            National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework, for
            training their OT personnel.

6.2.9. Wireless Communications
Wireless communications utilize radio frequency (RF) to support data transmission. This can
include a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) local area network communication based on IEEE 802.11
protocols and may also include cellular or other radio-based communications. RF-based
communications provide enhanced flexibility over traditional physical (i.e., wired)
communication capabilities. However, RF communications are also more susceptible to
interference and may allow unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop.
Supplemental guidance for wireless communications can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE
       802.11i
   •   NIST SP 800-121, Rev. 2, Guide to Bluetooth Security
   •   NIST SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
   •   NIST SP 800-187, Guide to LTE Security
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The use of temporary or permanent wireless communication within an
            OT is a risk-based decision determined by the organization. Generally,
            devices that utilize wireless communication should be placed in a
            separate network segment and only be deployed where the residual risks
            to health, safety, the environment, and finances are low.
            Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to identify
            antenna locations and signal strength for adequate coverage and to
            minimize the exposure of the wireless network to interference from OT
            environmental factors and eavesdropping. Attackers typically use


                                               120
NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            directional antennas to extend the effective range of a wireless network
            beyond the standard range.
            Organizations may choose to implement a wireless mesh network to
            improve resiliency or to eliminate areas with poor signal strength. Mesh
            networks can provide fault tolerance through alternate route selection
            and preemptive fail-over of the network. Organizations should also
            consider the performance and security impacts associated with the use of
            mesh networks. For example, when roaming between access points,
            devices may experience temporary communication loss. Roaming may
            also require different security controls to reduce the transition time.
            Organizations will need to find the appropriate balance between
            functional capabilities and cybersecurity to achieve the risk tolerance.
            Wireless LANs
                   •   Wireless device communications should be encrypted, and the
                       encryption must not degrade the operational performance of the
                       end devices. To reduce encryption latency, encryption should be
                       considered at OSI Layer 2 rather than at Layer 3. The use of
                       hardware accelerators to perform cryptographic functions should
                       also be considered.
                   •   Wireless access points should establish independent network
                       segments (rather than extending an existing segment) and be used
                       in combination with a boundary protection device to restrict and
                       control communication.
                   •   Wireless access points should be configured to have a unique
                       service set identifier (SSID) and enable media access control
                       (MAC) address filtering at a minimum.
                   •   Wireless devices may require different security controls and
                       should be zoned accordingly.
                   •   An adaptive routing protocol should be considered if the devices
                       are to be used for wireless mobility. The convergence time of the
                       network should be as fast as possible to support rapid network
                       recovery in the event of a failure or power loss.
            Wireless Field Networks
            When implementing a wireless field network, the following security
            features should be considered:
                   •   Selecting a standard, non-proprietary protocol (e.g., IEEE
                       802.15.x)
                   •   Ensuring that encryption is used between field instruments and
                       wireless access points
                   •   Allowlisting devices into the wireless device manager so that
                       rogue devices cannot connect


                                                  121

September 2023

                   •   Implementing appropriately complex passwords and join keys
            Most wireless field networks are inherently less reliable than their wired
            counterparts due to their susceptibility to signal jamming, distance
            limitations, and line-of-sight requirements. Work with the system vendor
            to design a wireless network that is appropriate for the application.

6.2.10.        Remote Access
Security controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized remote access to the
organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network (VPN) is a set of protocols
designed to support secure remote access to network environments. A VPN can provide both
strong authentication and encryption to secure communication data by establishing a private
network that operates as an overlay on a public infrastructure. The most common types of VPN
technologies are:
   •   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and
       tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (i.e., payload) of each packet while
       leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to
       each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side,
       an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet.
   •   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of
       Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that
       encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing
       Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic in a protocol implementation known as
       HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is not limited to HTTP traffic and can be used to
       secure many application-layer programs. Only TLS 1.2 or above should be considered.
   •   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining
       access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely
       control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application, is
       included in most UNIX distributions, and is typically added to other platforms through a
       third-party package.
Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-52, Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of
       Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations
   •   NIST SP 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle
       Management
   •   NIST SP 800-77, Rev. 1, Guide to IPsec VPNs
   •   NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Many OT security architectures are designed with multiple levels, such
            as in the Purdue model. This can significantly limit access, which can
            minimize accidental or unauthorized disruptions to operations. A process


                                                122
NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            should be developed and communicated to the organization for
            requesting and enabling remote access. Remote access should be
            provided only if justified and limited to what is required for the business
            need. Remote access should not circumvent or negate safety or security
            controls. Multi-factor authentication should be considered for remote
            access to the OT system.
            In critical situations or when vendor support is needed, temporary remote
            access may be requested to perform maintenance. In such cases,
            procedures should still be followed to ensure that secure connections are
            being utilized.
            There are several different techniques for implementing temporary
            remote access, including:
                   •   Users or protocols (e.g., RDP, SSH) that are temporarily
                       permitted through the OT or enterprise firewall
                   •   Screen-sharing technologies
                   •   Modems
                   •   VPNs
            Regardless of the technology, organizations should consider the
            following:
                   •   Implementing unique usernames and complex passwords
                   •   Removing, disabling, or modifying any default credentials
                   •   Updating any software and firmware to the latest versions
                   •   Removing access when no longer required. Consider
                       implementing automatic timers for removing access or managing
                       change processes to manually confirm the removal of access.
                   •   Monitoring remote activities
                   •   Ensuring that operations personnel are aware of planned remote
                       activity in the OT environment
                   •   Initiating the connection from the OT environment
                   •   Labeling remote connection devices so that operations may
                       disconnect quickly in the case of unauthorized use
            Dial-Up Modems
            If dial-up modems are used in OT environments, consider using callback
            systems. This ensures that a dialer is an authorized user by having the
            modem establish the working connection based on the dialer’s
            information and a callback number stored in the OT-approved authorized
            user list.




                                                  123

September 2023

            If feasible, disconnect modems when not in use, or consider automating
            this disconnection process by having modems disconnect after being on
            for a given amount of time. Sometimes, modem connections are part of
            the legal support service agreement with the vendor (e.g., 24/7 support
            with 15-minute response time). Personnel should be aware that
            disconnecting or removing the modems may require contracts to be
            renegotiated.
            VPNs
            VPN devices used to protect OT systems should be thoroughly tested to
            verify that the VPN technology is compatible with the application and
            that implementation of the VPN devices does not negatively impact
            network traffic characteristics.
            VPN technology can also be applied between network segments. For
            example, a remote site might have a boundary protection device on-site
            that uses a VPN to establish a secure tunnel over an untrusted network
            (e.g., the internet) to a VPN-enabled device in the main control center at
            a different location.

6.2.11.        Flaw Remediation and Patch Management
Patches are additional pieces of code that have been developed to address specific problems or
flaws in existing software. A systematic approach to managing and using software patches can
help organizations improve the overall security of their systems in a cost-effective way.
Organizations that actively manage and use software patches can reduce the chances that the
vulnerabilities in their systems can be exploited, and they can save time and money that might be
better spent responding to vulnerability-related incidents.
NIST SP 800-40, Rev. 4 [SP800-40r4] provides guidance for CIOs, CISOs, and others who are
responsible for managing organizational risk related to the use of software. This publication
frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies –
a cost of doing business and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to achieve
their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise patch
management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and operationalize
patching while also improving risk reduction. This guidance may also be useful to business and
mission owners, security engineers and architects, system administrators, and security operations
personnel.
Supplemental guidance for flaw remediation and patch management can be found in the
following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-40, Rev. 4, Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning: Preventive
       Maintenance for Technology
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Significant care should be exercised when applying patches to OS
            components. Patches should be adequately tested (e.g., offline system
            testing) to determine the acceptability of any performance impacts.


                                                124
NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Regression testing is also advised. It is not uncommon for patches to
            have an adverse impact on other software. A patch may remove a
            vulnerability, but it can also introduce a greater risk from a production or
            safety perspective. Patching the vulnerability may also change the way
            the OS or application works with control applications, causing the
            control application to lose some of its functionality. Many OT systems
            utilize older versions of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor,
            so patches may not be available.
            Organizations should implement a systematic, accountable, and
            documented OT patch management process for managing exposure to
            vulnerabilities. The patch management process should include guidance
            on how to monitor for patches, when to apply patches, how to test the
            patches (e.g., with vendors or on offline systems), and how to select
            compensating controls to limit exposure of the vulnerable system when
            patching is delayed.
            Many OT vulnerabilities are published to CISA as advisories. However,
            not all vendors report known vulnerabilities to CISA. Organizations can
            often stay informed of vulnerabilities by subscribing to vendor-specific
            notifications in addition to CISA alerts and advisories. Private
            cybersecurity companies also offer services to assist organizations with
            staying informed about known vulnerabilities within their OT
            environment. An organization is responsible for staying informed and
            determining when patches should be applied as part of their documented
            patch management process.
            When and how to deploy patches should be determined by
            knowledgeable OT personnel. Consider separating the automated process
            for OT patch management from the automated process for non-OT
            applications. Patching should be deployed during planned OT outages.
            Organizations may be required to follow industry-specific guidance on
            patch management. Otherwise, they may develop patch management
            procedures based on existing standards, such as NIST SP 800-40, Rev. 4
            [SP800-40r4]; NERC CIP-007, or ISA 62443-2-3, Patch Management in
            the IACS Environment.

6.2.12.        Time Synchronization
Time synchronization solutions enable an organization to synchronize time across many devices.
This is important for many functions, including event and log correlation, authentication
mechanisms, access control, and quality of service.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management
   •   NIST IR 8323, Foundational PNT Profile: Applying the Cybersecurity Framework for
       the Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services


                                                125
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Synchronizing the internal clocks of OT systems and devices is critical
            for cyber event correlation and other OT functions (e.g., motion control).
            If a device or system clock is inaccurate, the timestamps generated by
            the clock for event and log entries will also be inaccurate, as well as any
            other functions that utilize the clock.
            A common time should be used across all OT devices. Utilizing multiple
            time sources can benefit OT devices by reducing clock error and
            providing backup time sources if the primary time source is lost or if the
            time quality of a primary time source has degraded.
            Authenticated Network Time Protocol (NTP) and secure Precision Time
            Protocol (PTP) (i.e., PTP with an authentication TLV [type, length,
            value]) can be used if there is a risk of malicious modification to the
            network time (e.g., RF jamming, packet spoofing, denial of service).
            Non-authenticated NTP is susceptible to spoofing and should be located
            behind the firewall.
            Time sources located in the OT environment should be included in the
            system and network monitoring programs. If available, logs from each
            time source (e.g., syslog) should be forwarded to a log collection system.

       Detect (DE)
The Detect Function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events by ensuring that
appropriate activities are developed and implemented.

6.3.1. Anomalies and Events (DE.AE)
Organizations should understand different events, anomalies, and their potential impacts to
systems and the environment to establish an effective detection capability. Within any
environment, numerous non-malicious and potentially malicious events and anomalies occur
almost continuously. Some examples of common events include:
Information Events
   •   Multiple failed logon attempts
   •   Locked-out accounts
   •   Unauthorized creation of new accounts
   •   Unexpected remote logons (e.g., logons of individuals who are on vacation, remote logon
       when the individual is expected to be local, remote logon for maintenance support when
       no support was requested)
   •   Cleared event logs
   •   Unexpectedly full event logs
   •   Antivirus or IDS alerts


                                                126
NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

   •   Disabled antivirus or other security controls
   •   Requests for information about the system or architecture (e.g., social engineering or
       phishing attempts)
Operational Events
   •   Unauthorized configuration changes
   •   Unauthorized patching of systems
   •   Unplanned shutdowns
Physical Access Events
   •   Physical intrusions
Networking Events
   •   Unexpected communication, including new ports or protocols being used without
       appropriate change management
   •   Unusually heavy network traffic
   •   Unauthorized devices connecting to the network
   •   Unauthorized communication to external IPs
Organizations should consider that not all events and anomalies are malicious or require
investigation. Organizations should define incident alerting thresholds and response requirements
for the events and anomalies that affect their systems and environment to establish an efficient
incident detection capability.
Organizations should consider collecting and correlating event data from multiple sources and
sensors using automated mechanisms where possible to improve detecting and alerting
capabilities. For example, a centralized intrusion detection system could accept data feeds and
logs from multiple devices and network segments to identify organization- or environment-
specific events and sound an alarm. Detection tools should also be integrated with asset
management tools. This integration can provide additional context to an event (e.g., where the
system is located, which firmware version it runs, what the criticality of the system is) to help an
organization determine the event impact.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management
   •   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
   •   NIST SP 1800-7, Situational Awareness for Electric Utilities
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider OT-specific events and anomalies for
            their processes and environments. Organizations should also note that
            some tools and alerts for behaviors or events that could indicate an
            intrusion may be normal behaviors and events within the OT
            environment. To reduce false positive and nuisance alarms, organizations


                                                127
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            should establish their OT alerting thresholds based on baselines of
            normal network traffic and data flows in addition to normal human and
            OT process behavior. Additionally, OT components are often physically
            remote and not continually staffed. Alerting thresholds may need to take
            into consideration the response time associated with the alert. For
            example, a temperature alert threshold may have to be set to alert earlier
            based on the expected response time to correct the situation in order to
            avoid an incident.
            Shared credentials are often used on OT systems. Anomalous behavior
            on shared accounts may be more difficult to determine, so organizations
            should consider whether additional controls are required, such as
            identifying the use of shared credentials using physical access
            monitoring.

6.3.2. Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM)
Organizations should implement continuous monitoring as part of the organizational risk
management strategy to monitor the effectiveness of protective measures. This includes
establishing the frequency for evaluating the implementation of the desired outcomes.
Continuous monitoring can be performed by internal or external resources to identify security
gaps within the environment. Peer reviews (i.e., cold eyes reviews) between sites of the same
organization are highly encouraged. When leveraging third-party services for security continuous
monitoring, it is important to understand and evaluate how the organization’s continuous
monitoring data is protected by the third party. A third party that aggregates continuous
monitoring information from multiple organizations may be a desirable target for adversaries.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-53A, Rev. 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information
       Systems and Organizations
   •   NIST SP 800-55, Rev. 1, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security
   •   NIST SP 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment

       Programs: Developing an ISCM Program Assessment
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may find that automation within OT environments may
            not be possible due to the sensitivity of the systems or the resources
            required to support the automation. For example, some automated
            systems may utilize active scanning to support vulnerability or patch
            management or to validate device configurations. Solutions that perform
            active scanning or use local resources to support automation should be
            tested before deployment into the OT system.


                                               128
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Continuous monitoring can be achieved using automated tools, through
            passive scanning, or with manual monitoring performed at a frequency
            deemed commensurate with the risk. For example, a risk assessment may
            determine that the logs from isolated (i.e., non-networked), non-critical
            devices should be reviewed monthly by OT personnel to determine
            whether anomalous behavior is occurring. Alternatively, a passive
            network monitor might be able to detect vulnerable network services
            without having to scan the devices.
            When organizations implement a sampling methodology, the criticality
            of the components should be considered. For example, the sampling
            methodology should not inadvertently exclude higher risk devices, such
            as Layer 3 or Layer 4 firewalls.
            When using third parties to continuously monitor security controls,
            ensure that the personnel involved have the appropriate skillset to
            analyze OT environments.

6.3.2.1.       Network Monitoring (DE.CM-1)
Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for
signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Organizations should consider automation – including
in-house developed, commercially available solutions or some combination of tools – to assist
with monitoring efforts. Tools and capabilities that support behavior anomaly detection (BAD),
security information and event management (SIEM), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and
intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout
the network and generate alarms when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other
capabilities to consider for network monitoring include:
   •   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the
       network
   •   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications
   •   Diagnosing network performance issues
   •   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
   •   NIST IR 8219, Securing Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems: Behavioral Anomaly
       Detection
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Network monitoring can greatly enhance the ability to detect attacks
            entering or leaving the OT networks. It can also improve network
            efficiency by detecting non-essential traffic. OT cybersecurity personnel
            must be part of the diagnostic process of interpreting the alerts provided
            by network monitoring tools. Careful monitoring and an understanding


                                               129
NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            of the normal state of the OT network can help distinguish transient
            conditions from legitimate attacks and provide insight into events that
            are outside of the normal state.
            Gaining access to network traffic is typically performed with network
            test access points (TAPs) and switched port analyzer (SPAN) ports,
            though performance impacts to the OT system may result from their use,
            especially with SPAN ports.
            Network sensors should be placed to effectively monitor the OT
            network. Typical installations locate the network sensors between the
            control network and corporate network, but other locations can include
            network perimeters, key network segments (e.g., DMZ), and critical OT
            devices.
            All sensors should be subjected to extensive testing and be implemented
            in a test environment before being deployed into the OT network.
            Configuring the sensor into a test or learning mode after it is installed on
            the network provides an opportunity to tune the device with real OT
            network traffic. Tuning can help reduce false positive alerts, reduce the
            alert “noise” from typical network traffic, and help identify
            implementation and configuration problems.
            Failure modes of network sensors in the event of a sensor failure should
            be considered (e.g., does the sensor fail-safe or fail-open if the device
            fails).

6.3.2.2.       System Use Monitoring (DE.CM-1 and DE-CM-3)
System use monitoring solutions enable an organization to monitor, store, and audit system
events (e.g., system logs, running processes, file access and modification, system and application
configuration changes) that occur within a system. Monitoring users and systems helps to ensure
that they are behaving as expected and can aid in troubleshooting when events occur by
providing information about which users were working within the system during the event.
System and device misconfigurations can also be identified.
Compared to network monitoring, system use monitoring solutions can analyze activity that does
not traverse the network. In host-based solutions, this can be achieved with real-time monitoring
of inter-process communications and other internal OS data, while active scanning solutions
gather information by querying the OS or application programming interfaces (APIs).
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
   •   NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal
       Information Systems and Organizations
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Situational awareness of the OT system is imperative to understanding
            the current state of the system, validating that it is operating as intended,


                                                 130

            and ensuring that no policy violations or cyber incidents have hindered
            its operation. Strong device monitoring, logging, and auditing are
            necessary to collect, correlate, and analyze security-related information
            and provide actionable communication about the security status across
            the complete OT system. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the
            information gathered by system use monitoring solutions can be used to
            perform forensic analysis of the OT system.
            System use monitoring solutions can generate significant amounts of
            events, so these solutions should be used in combination with a control
            log management system, such as a SIEM, to help filter the types of
            events and reduce alert fatigue. The amount of tuning and customization
            of events and alerts depends on the type of OT system and the number of
            devices in the system.
            System use monitoring solutions should be subjected to extensive testing
            and implemented in a test environment before being deployed to devices
            in the OT system. Concerns include the performance impacts of host-
            based agents on devices, the impact of active scanning on devices, and
            the capability of the network infrastructure bandwidth. Separate
            appliances can offload the processing. Host-based agents can impact the
            performance of the OT device because of the resources that they
            consume.

6.3.2.3.       Malicious Code Detection (DE.CM-4)
When stored, processed, and transmitted, files and data streams should be scanned using
specialized tools with a combination of heuristic algorithms and known malware signatures to
detect and block potentially malicious code. Malicious code protection tools only function
effectively when they are installed, configured, run full-time, and maintained properly against
the state of known attack methods and payloads.
Supplemental guidance for anti-malware practices can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-83, Rev. 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for
       Desktops and Laptops
   •   NIST SP 1058, Using Host-Based Anti-Virus Software on Industrial Control Systems:
       Integration Guidance and a Test Methodology for Assessing Performance Impacts
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            While antivirus tools are common in IT computer systems, the use of
            antivirus with OT may require adopting special practices, including
            compatibility checks, change management, and performance impact
            metrics. These practices should be utilized to test new signatures and
            new versions of antivirus software.
            Some OT vendors recommend and even support the use of vendor-
            specific antivirus tools. In some cases, OT system vendors may have
            performed regression testing across their product line for supported


                                               131
NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            versions of a particular antivirus tool and provide associated installation
            and configuration documentation.
            Generally:
                   •   General-purpose Windows, Unix, and Linux systems that are
                       used as engineering workstations, data historians, maintenance
                       laptops, and backup servers can be secured like commercial IT
                       equipment by installing push or auto-updated antivirus software
                       with updates distributed via an antivirus server located inside the
                       process control network. Follow organization-developed
                       procedures for transferring the latest updates from known vendor
                       sites to the OT antivirus servers and other OT computers and
                       servers.
                   •   Follow vendor recommendations on all other servers and
                       computers (e.g., DCS, PLC, instruments) that have time-
                       dependent code, modified or extended OSs, or any other change
                       that makes them different from a standard PC. Test the antivirus
                       software and updates on an offline system if possible (e.g., install
                       on a backup HMI and validate that performance is not degraded
                       before applying to the primary HMI).
            According to NIST SP 1058 [SP1058], antivirus software may
            negatively impact the time-critical control processes of an ICS. The SP
            also identified significant CPU usage when running manual scans and
            signature updates, which could have negative impacts on OT computers
            and servers. As a result:
                   •   Configuration of the antivirus software should be tested on an
                       offline system, if possible.
                   •   Manual scanning and signature updates should be performed
                       while the system is not critical for operations.
                   •   Redundancy should be considered for critical systems that require
                       ongoing antivirus updates such that signature updates can be
                       performed without impacting operations (e.g., consoles and
                       HMIs).
                   •   When configuring file exclusion lists, determine which control
                       application files should not be scanned during production time
                       because of possible OT system malfunction or performance
                       degradation.
            CISA provides a recommended practice for updating antivirus in OT
            environments.

September 2023

6.3.2.4.       Vulnerability Scanning (DE.CM-8)
Vulnerabilities can be identified through a combination of automated and manual techniques.
These vulnerability scans should be performed on an ongoing basis to capture new
vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Some common ways to achieve vulnerability identification in the OT
            environment are:
                   •   Continuous monitoring using passive or active scanning
                       capabilities. Organizations should consider how vulnerability
                       scanning tools may impact OT components and communications
                       by testing them in an offline environment prior to implementing
                       them in production.
                          o Passive scanning tools typically utilize network traffic
                            analyzers to detect assets and determine possible
                            vulnerabilities affecting the assets.
                          o Active scanning tools typically utilize an agent to connect
                            to networked assets and perform detailed queries and
                            analysis of the components to determine possible
                            vulnerabilities affecting the assets.
                   •   Performance testing, load testing, and penetration testing if the
                       test will not adversely impact the production environment
                   •   Regular audits, assessments, and peer reviews to identify gaps in
                       security

6.3.3. Detection Process (DE.DP)
The detection process includes maintaining and testing processes, procedures, and tools to ensure
that anomalous events are identified in a prompt manner and responsible parties (individuals) are
alerted and held accountable for adequate responses. To ensure the ongoing awareness of
anomalous events, define roles and responsibilities for accountability, periodically review that
detection activities comply with the requirements, test the detection processes regularly,
communicate detected events to appropriate personnel to act, and continuously improve
detection capabilities.

       Respond (RS)
The Respond Function supports the ability to take the appropriate course of action and activities
to contain a cybersecurity incident when it occurs.

6.4.1. Response Planning (RS.RP)
When responding to events, organizations should attempt to capture the details associated with
executing the documented response plans. This may help organizations identify gaps or potential
opportunities for improvement in the response plan during the post-incident review process. Due
to the time sensitivity of response efforts, organizations may want to consider other techniques
(e.g., reviewing logs, reviewing video footage captured during the response activities, or
interviewing response personnel) if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the
time to complete the response plan.

6.4.2. Response Communications (RS.CO)
Responding to a cybersecurity incident includes coordinating with internal and external
stakeholders. An incident response team should be assembled. Depending on the complexity and
impact of the incident, the incident response team could consist of one or many individuals who
have been trained on incident response. The FEMA National Incident Management System
(NIMS) can be used to standardize common terminology and roles for incident response.
Prior to an incident, organizations should consider how to communicate with response personnel
and external entities, including:
   •   Developing an email distribution list for incident response
   •   Leveraging an emergency notification system
   •   Establishing backup communication plans for radio, phone, or email if primary
       communication systems fail
   •   Designating a spokesperson for external communications
   •   Designating a scribe for internal incident communications
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider FEMA’s guidance on crisis
            communications when establishing their communication plans and
            strategies.
            The personnel responsible for responding to an incident should be
            informed of and trained on their responsibilities.
            The response plan should include a detailed list of organizations and
            personnel that should be contacted for incident response and reporting
            under various circumstances. Each individual should be assigned roles
            that are required for incident response, which could include incident
            commander; operations, planning, logistics, or finance/administration



                                               134
NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            section chief or member; and public information, safety, or liaison
            officer.
            To support a response in an OT environment, an organization should
            consider including the following personnel in the response plan.
            Internal Resources
                   •   Designated Incident Commander
                   •   Operations leadership
                   •   Safety personnel
                   •   On-call OT systems personnel
                   •   On-call IT personnel
                   •   Physical security personnel
                   •   Administrative personnel
                   •   Procurement personnel
                   •   Public relations personnel
                   •   Legal personnel
            External Industry Partners
                   •   OT technical support (e.g., vendors, integrators)
                   •   Operational supply chain (e.g., suppliers, customers, distributors,
                       business partners)
                   •   Incident response team
                   •   Surge support
                   •   Impacted community (e.g., facility neighbors)
            Organizations are required to report incidents involving federal agencies
            in accordance with PPD-21 [PPD-21] and PPD-41 [PPD-41]. CISA
            maintains the list of sector-specific contacts.
            Legal departments can often assist with developing non-disclosure
            agreements or other contracts if an organization plans to utilize external
            resources for incident response. It may be beneficial to develop these
            contracts prior to an incident occurring so that incident response can be
            immediate. Private companies can be held on retainer in case of an OT
            incident.

September 2023

6.4.3. Response Analysis (RS.AN)
Cybersecurity incidents are analyzed to ensure effective response and recovery activities that are
consistent with the detection process and the response plan. Analysis includes reviewing
notifications, determining whether an investigation is required, understanding potential impacts,
performing forensics, categorizing the incident consistent with the response plan, and analyzing
disclosed vulnerabilities.
Supplemental guidance for the response analysis controls can be found in the following
document:
   •   NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When determining the overall impact of a cybersecurity incident,
            consider the dependencies of OT and its resulting impact on operations.
            For example, an OT system may be dependent on IT for business
            applications, such that an incident on the IT network results in an OT
            disconnect or shutdown.
            If an organization does not have adequate resources or capabilities to
            conduct OT forensics, consider engaging external organizations to
            perform forensic analysis.
            Organizations should identify and classify cyber and non-cyber incidents
            that affect the OT environment according to the incident response plan.
            When developing the OT incident response plan, potential classes of
            incidents could include accidental actions taken by authorized personnel,
            targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks.

6.4.4. Response Mitigation (RS.MI)
Mitigation activities are meant to prevent expansion of the incident, mitigate its effects, and
resolve the incident and should be consistent with the response plan.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT components are often physically remote and not continually staffed.
            For these cases, consider how the organization would respond during an
            incident and the additional time required to coordinate the response. The
            system may need to be designed with the capability to minimize impacts
            until personnel can arrive on-site (e.g., remote shutdown or disconnects).
            Cyber incident mitigation may involve process shutdowns or
            communication disconnects that impact operations. These impacts
            should be understood and communicated during incident mitigation.

September 2023

6.4.5. Response Improvements (RS.IM)
Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current
and previous detection and response activities. Organizations should designate one or more
individuals to be responsible for documenting and communicating response actions to the
incident response team, which can later be reviewed for lessons learned.

       Recover (RC)
Timely recovery to normal operations after a cybersecurity incident is critical. The Recover
Function addresses developing and implementing activities to maintain system resilience and
ensure timely restoration of capabilities and services affected by a cybersecurity incident.

6.5.1. Recovery Planning (RC.RP)
When recovering from events, organizations should attempt to capture details associated with the
execution of the documented recovery plans. Capturing execution details may help organizations
during the post-incident review process to determine whether any gaps or potential opportunities
for improvement in the recovery plan should be considered. Due to the time sensitivity of
recovery efforts, organizations may want to consider other techniques (e.g., reviewing logs,
reviewing video footage captured during the recovery activities, or interviewing recovery
personnel) if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the time to complete the
recovery plan.
Supplemental guidance for recovery planning can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure

6.5.2. Recovery Improvements (RC.IM)
As a recovery effort is ongoing, the recovery steps taken should be documented to identify
lessons learned. These lessons can be used to improve recovery plans and processes.
Supplemental guidance for recovery improvements can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery




                                              137

September 2023

6.5.3. Recovery Communications (RC.CO)
Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties. In addition to operational
recovery, an organization may need to manage public relations and repair its reputation.
Supplemental guidance for recovery communications can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-184, Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A list of internal and external resources for recovery activities should be
            developed as part of the recovery planning effort. During an event, this
            list should be used to get all necessary personnel on-site, as required, to
            recover within the RTO and RPO.
            Internal Communications
                   •   OT personnel
                   •   IT personnel
                   •   Procurement
                   •   Management with appropriate authority to approve the cost of
                       recovery
                   •   Storage or warehouse personnel
            External Communications
                   •   OT vendors
                   •   Security companies that may be held on retainer for response and
                       recovery efforts
                   •   Storage or warehouse personnel
                   •   Internet service providers
                   •   Owners of the attacking systems and potential victims

Appendix B. Glossary
Selected terms used in this publication are defined below. Source references are included for
certain definitions.
access control list
A mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by enumerating the identities of the system
entities that are permitted to access the resources. [RFC4949] (adapted)

actuator
A device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, typically electric
current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the
mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed
mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g., a printer driver, robot control system), or a human or other
agent.

alarm
A device or function that signals the existence of an abnormal condition by making an audible or visible discrete
change, or both, so as to attract attention to that condition. [ANSI-ISA-5-1]

antivirus tools
Software products and technology used to detect malicious code, prevent it from infecting a system, and remove
malicious code that has infected the system.

attack
An attempt to gain unauthorized access to system services, resources, or information or an attempt to compromise
system integrity, availability, or confidentiality.

authentication
Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an
information system. [FIPS200]

authorization
The right or a permission that is granted to a system entity to access a system resource. [RFC4949] (adapted)

backdoor

Appendix C. Threat Sources, Vulnerabilities, and Incidents
Several terms are used to describe the interrelated concepts of threat, threat source, threat event,
and incident. A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of
service. Threats have some intent or method that may exploit a vulnerability through either
intentional or unintentional means. This intent or method is referred to as the threat source. A
vulnerability is a weakness in an information system (including an OT), system security
procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat
source. A threat event is an event or situation that has the potential to cause undesirable
consequences or impacts. When a threat event occurs, it becomes an incident that actually or
potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or
the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or
imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
This appendix explores OT-specific threat sources, vulnerabilities, and incidents. It also cites
examples of OT-specific incidents to illustrate their potential impacts. Each organization
calculates risk based on the specific threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and likelihood of incidents
within their environment.

C.1.    Threat Sources
Threats to OT can come from numerous sources that can be classified as adversarial, accidental,
structural, or environmental. Table 13 lists and defines known threat sources to OT. These threat
sources should be considered part of the risk management strategy. The threat source must be
well understood in order to define and implement adequate protection. For example,
environmental events (e.g., floods, earthquakes) are well understood but may vary in their
magnitude, frequency, and ability to compound other interconnected events. However,
adversarial threats depend on the resources available to the adversary and the emergence of
previously unknown vulnerabilities or attacks.

C.2.   Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in information systems, system procedures, controls, or
implementations that can be exploited by a threat source. Predisposing conditions are properties
of the organization, mission or business process, architecture, or information systems that
contribute to the likelihood of a threat event. The order of these vulnerabilities and predisposing
conditions does not reflect priority in terms of likelihood of occurrence or severity of impact.
Additionally, the vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions identified in this section should not
be considered a complete list, nor should they be assumed to occur in every OT environment.
Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are grouped according to where they exist, such as in
the organization’s policy and procedures, or the inadequacy of security mechanisms


                                                      170

implemented in hardware, firmware, and software. The former is referred to as being in the
organization and the latter as being in the system. Understanding the source of vulnerabilities
and predisposing conditions can help identify optimal mitigation strategies. Deeper analysis may
uncover that causes and observations may not be one-to-one – that is, some underlying causes
may exhibit multiple symptoms, and some symptoms may come from more than one cause.
Any given OT will usually exhibit a subset of the identified vulnerabilities in this appendix but
may also contain additional vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions that are unique to a
particular technology or implementation. Specific current information on OT vulnerabilities can
be found on the CISA website, though many vendors publish notifications and patches that are
not always found on the CISA website. It is beneficial to maintain relationships with vendors in
order to stay up to date with known vulnerabilities.
Some vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can be mitigated. Others can only be accepted
and controlled by appropriate countermeasures but will result in some residual risk to the OT
environment. For example, some existing policies and procedures may be changed with a level
of effort that the organization considers acceptable, while others are more expeditiously dealt
with by instituting additional policies and procedures.
Vulnerabilities in the products and services acquired from outside of the organization are rarely
under the direct control of the organization. Changes may be influenced by market forces, but
this is a slow and indirect approach. Instead, the organization may change predisposing
conditions to reduce the likelihood that a systemic vulnerability will be exploited.

C.2.1. Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are often introduced into the OT environment
because of incomplete, inappropriate, or nonexistent security policy, including documentation,
implementation guides (e.g., procedures), and enforcement. Management support of security
policy and procedures is the cornerstone of any security program. Organization security policy
can reduce vulnerabilities by mandating and enforcing proper conduct. Written policy and
procedures are mechanisms for informing staff and stakeholders of decisions about behavior that
is beneficial to the organization. From this perspective, policy is an educational and instructive
way to reduce vulnerabilities. Enforcement is a partner to policy and encourages people to do the
proper thing. Various forms of corrective action are the usual consequences to personnel not
following policy and procedures. Policies should be explicit about the consequences to
individuals or organizations that do not conform.
There is usually a complex policy and procedure environment that includes laws, regulations,
overlapping jurisdictions and spheres of influence, economics, custom, and history. The larger
enterprise is often subdivided into organizational units that should work together to reduce
vulnerabilities. The scope and hierarchical relationship among policies and procedures needs to
be managed for maximum effectiveness.

conditions for OT.

           Vulnerability                                               Description
  Inadequate organizational           Risk assessments should be performed with acknowledgement from
  ownership of risk assessments       appropriate levels within the organization. The lack of understanding of
                                      risk could lead to under-mitigated scenarios or inadequate funding and
                                      selection of controls.
  Inadequate security policy for OT   Vulnerabilities are often introduced into the OT environment due to
                                      inadequate policies or the lack of policies specifically for OT system
                                      security. Controls and countermeasures should be derived from a risk
                                      assessment or policy to ensure uniformity and accountability.
  Inadequate OT security training     A documented formal OT security training and awareness program is
  and awareness program               designed to keep staff up to date on organizational security policies and
                                      procedures, threats, industry cybersecurity standards, and recommended
                                      practices. Without adequate ongoing training on specific OT policies and
                                      procedures, staff cannot be expected to maintain a secure OT environment.
  Lack of inventory management        Inventory policy and procedures should include installation, removal, and
  policy                              changes made to hardware, firmware, and software. An incomplete
                                      inventory could lead to unmanaged and unprotected devices within the OT
                                      environment.
  Lack of configuration               Lack of policy and procedures for OT configuration management can lead
  management policy                   to an unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of hardware,
                                      firmware, and software.
  Inadequate OT equipment             Equipment implementation guidelines should be kept up to date and
  implementation guidelines           readily available. These guidelines are an integral part of security
                                      procedures in the event of an OT malfunction.
  Lack of administrative              Without accountability for enforcing policy, there is limited ability to
  mechanisms for security policy      ensure that security policies are followed adequately. Administrative
  enforcement                         mechanisms should be in place to ensure accountability.
  Inadequate review of the            Procedures and schedules should exist to determine the extent to which the
  effectiveness of the OT security    security program and its constituent controls are implemented correctly,
  controls                            operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
                                      meeting the security requirements of the OT. The examination is
                                      sometimes called an “audit,” “evaluation,” or “assessment.” Policy should
                                      address the stage of the life cycle, purpose, technical expertise,
                                      methodology, and level of independence.
  No OT-specific contingency plan     A contingency plan (e.g., business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan)
                                      should be prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware
                                      or software failure or destruction of facilities. The lack of a specific plan
                                      for the OT could lead to extended downtimes and production losses.
  Lack of adequate access control     Access control enforcement depends on policy that correctly models roles,
  policy                              responsibilities, and authorizations. The policy model must enable the way
                                      the organization functions.
  Lack of adequate authentication     Authentication policies are needed to define when authentication
  policy                              mechanisms (e.g., passwords, smart cards) must be used, how strong they
                                      must be, and how they must be maintained. Without this policy, systems
                                      may not have appropriate authentication controls, making unauthorized
                                      access to systems more likely. Authentication policies should be
                                      developed as part of an overall OT security program, taking into account
                                      the capabilities of the OT and its personnel to handle more complex
                                      passwords and other mechanisms.

            Vulnerability                                             Description
  Inadequate incident detection and   Incident detection and response plans, procedures, and methods are
  response plan and procedures        necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction,
                                      preserving evidence for later forensic examination, mitigating the
                                      weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring services. Establishing a
                                      successful incident response capability includes continually monitoring for
                                      anomalies, prioritizing the handling of incidents, and implementing
                                      effective methods for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.
  Lack of redundancy for critical     Lack of redundancy in critical components could provide single-point-of-
  components                          failure possibilities.


C.2.2. System Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Security controls must clearly identify the systems to which they apply. Systems range widely in
size, scope, and capability. At the small end of the spectrum, a system may be an individual
hardware or software product or service. At the other end of the spectrum are large and complex
systems, systems-of-systems, and networks, all of which incorporate hardware architectures and
software frameworks (including application frameworks) to support operations. An organization
may choose to identify security zones such that security controls may be applied to all systems
within the security zone.
System vulnerabilities can occur in the hardware, firmware, and software used to build the OT.
Sources of vulnerabilities include design flaws, development flaws, misconfigurations, poor
maintenance, poor administration, and connections with other systems and networks. Many of
the controls in the NIST SP 800-53 and the OT overlay in Appendix F specify what the system
must do to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities can also exist in the auxiliary components that support the OT systems. A subset
of those vulnerabilities with the potential to impact the physical process are described in this
section.
The potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions commonly found within OT systems
are categorized into the following tables:
   •    Table 15. Architecture and design vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions
   •    Table 16. Configuration and maintenance vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

             Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Inadequate incorporation of            Incorporating security into the OT architecture and design must start with
  security into architecture and         a budget and schedule designated for OT. The architectures must address
  design                                 the identification and authorization of users, access control mechanism,
                                         network topologies, and system configuration and integrity mechanisms.
  Inadequate management of change        The network infrastructure within the OT environment has often been
  that allows insecure architecture to   developed and modified based on business and operational requirements
  evolve                                 with little consideration for the potential security impacts of the changes.
                                         Over time, security gaps may have been inadvertently introduced within
                                         the infrastructure. Without remediation, these gaps may represent
                                         backdoors into the OT.
                                         Sensors and controllers that were historically simple devices are now often
                                         manufactured as intelligent devices. In some cases, sensors and controllers
                                         may be replaced with IIoT devices that allow direct internet connections.
                                         Security should be incorporated into change management for all OT
                                         devices, not just traditional IT components.
  No security perimeter defined          If the OT does not have a security perimeter clearly defined, it is not
                                         possible to ensure that the necessary security controls are deployed and
                                         configured properly. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and
                                         data, as well as other problems.
  Control networks used for non-         Control and non-control traffic have different requirements, such as
  control traffic                        determinism and reliability. Having both types of traffic on a single
                                         network creates challenges for meeting the requirements of control traffic.
                                         For example, non-control traffic could inadvertently consume resources
                                         that control traffic needs, causing disruptions in OT functions.
  Control network services               When IT services such as a Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic
  dependent on a non-control             Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used by control networks, they
  network                                are often implemented in the IT network. This causes the OT network to
                                         become dependent on the IT network, which may not have the reliability
                                         and availability requirements needed by OT.
  Inadequate collection of event data    Forensic analysis depends on the collection and retention of sufficient
  history                                data. Without proper and accurate data collection, it may be impossible to
                                         determine what caused a security incident to occur. Incidents might go
                                         unnoticed, leading to additional damage and/or disruption. Regular
                                         security monitoring is also needed to identify problems with security
                                         controls, such as misconfigurations and failures.
                                         Event data for an OT environment could include physical process data,
                                         system use data, and network data.


           Table 16. Configuration and maintenance vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

             Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Hardware, firmware, and software       The organization does not know what it has (e.g., make, model), where

  management                             defense posture. To properly secure an OT, there should be an accurate
                                         inventory of the assets in the environment. Procedures should be in place
                                         to manage additions, deletions, and modifications of assets, which include
                                         asset inventory management. These procedures are critical to executing

            Vulnerability                                                Description
  Hardware, firmware, and software     The organization does not know the patch management status, security
  are not under configuration          settings, or configuration versions that it has, resulting in an inconsistent
  management                           and ineffective defense posture. A lack of configuration change
                                       management procedures can lead to security oversights, exposures, and
                                       risks. A process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware,
                                       software, and documentation should be implemented to ensure that an OT
                                       is protected against inadequate or improper modifications before, during,
                                       and after system implementation. To properly secure an OT, there should
                                       be an accurate listing or repository of the current configurations.
  OS and vendor software patches       Because of the tight coupling between OT software and the underlying
  may not be developed until long      OT, changes must undergo expensive and time-consuming comprehensive
  after security vulnerabilities are   regression testing. The elapsed time for such testing and the subsequent
  found                                distribution of updated software provides a long window of vulnerability.
                                       Vulnerability management procedures should include flexibility for
                                       interim alternative mitigations.
  Vendor declines to develop           Out-of-date OSs and applications may contain newly discovered
  patches for vulnerability            vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Security patch support may not be
                                       available for legacy OT, so vulnerability management procedures should
                                       include contingency plans for mitigating vulnerabilities where patches
                                       may never be available or replacement plans.
  Lack of a vulnerability              Vulnerabilities not considered by the organization could result in
  management program                   exploitation. Vulnerability management procedures should be in place to
                                       determine a plan of action or inaction upon the discovery of a
                                       vulnerability. Some OT considerations are: availability concerns may push
                                       patching until the next planned operational downtime; security patch
                                       support may not be available for OT systems that use outdated OSs;
                                       isolated systems may not require immediate patching; and OT exposed to
                                       the internet may need to be prioritized for patching.
  Inadequate testing of security       Modifications to hardware, firmware, and software deployed without
  changes                              testing could compromise normal operation of the OT. Documented
                                       procedures should be developed for testing all changes for security
                                       impacts. The live operational systems should never be used for testing.
                                       The testing of system modifications may need to be coordinated with
                                       system vendors and integrators.
  Poor remote access controls          There are many reasons why an OT may need to be remotely accessed,
                                       including vendors and system integrators performing system maintenance
                                       functions or OT engineers accessing geographically remote system
                                       components. The concept of least privilege should be applied to remote
                                       access controls. Remote access capabilities must be adequately controlled
                                       to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access or authorized
                                       individuals from gaining excessive access to the OT.
  Poor configurations are used         Improperly configured systems may leave unnecessary ports and protocols
                                       open. These unnecessary functions may contain vulnerabilities that
                                       increase the overall risk to the system. Using default configurations often
                                       exposes vulnerabilities and exploitable services. All settings should be
                                       examined.
  Critical configurations are not      Procedures should be available for restoring OT configuration settings in

                                       maintain system availability and prevent the loss of data. Documented
                                       procedures should be developed for maintaining configuration settings.
  Data unprotected on portable         System security could be compromised if sensitive data (e.g., passwords,
  device                               dial-up numbers) is stored in cleartext on lost or stolen portable devices,
                                       such as laptops and mobile devices. Policy, procedures, and mechanisms
                                       are required for protection.

           Vulnerability                                                  Description
  Vendor default passwords are used     Most vendor default passwords are easy to discover within vendor product
                                        manuals, which are also available to adversaries. Using the default
                                        password can drastically increase OT vulnerability.
  Password generation, use, and         Password policy and procedures must be followed to be effective.
  protection do not comply with         Violations of password policy and procedures can increase OT
  policy                                vulnerability.
  Inadequate access controls applied    Access controls must match how the organization allocates
                                        responsibilities and privilege to its personnel. Poorly specified access
                                        controls can result in an OT user having too many or too few privileges.
                                        The following exemplify each case:
                                        • System configured with default access control settings gives an
                                             operator administrative privileges
                                        • System configured improperly results in an operator being unable to
                                             take corrective actions in an emergency situation
  Improper data linking                 OT data storage systems may be linked to non-OT data sources. An
                                        example of this is database links, which allow data from one database
                                        (e.g., data historian) to be automatically replicated on others. Data linkage
                                        may create a vulnerability if it is not properly configured and may allow
                                        unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  Malware protection is not installed   The installation of malware (i.e., malicious software) is a common attack.
  or up to date                         Malware protection software, such as antivirus software, should be kept
                                        current in a dynamic environment. Outdated malware protection software
                                        and definitions leave the system open to malware threats.
  Malware protection implemented        Malware protection software that is deployed without sufficient testing
  without sufficient testing            could impact normal operation of the OT and block the system from
                                        performing necessary control actions.
  Denial of service (DoS)               OT software could be vulnerable to DoS attacks, resulting in the
                                        prevention of authorized access to a system resource or delaying system
                                        operations and functions.
  Intrusion detection and prevention    Incidents can result in loss of system availability and integrity; the
  software is not installed             capture, modification, and deletion of data; and incorrect execution of
                                        control commands. IDS/IPS software may stop or prevent various types of
                                        attacks, including DoS attacks, and also identify attacked internal hosts,
                                        such as those infected with worms. IDS/IPS software must be tested prior
                                        to deployment to ensure that it does not compromise normal operation of
                                        the OT.
  Logs are not maintained               Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine
                                        what caused a security event to occur and perform adequate forensics.

                         Table 17. Physical vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

            Vulnerability                                                Description
  Unauthorized personnel have           Physical access to OT equipment should be restricted to only the
  physical access to equipment          necessary personnel while taking safety requirements into account, such as
                                        emergency shutdown or restarts. Improper access to OT equipment can
                                        lead to any of the following:
                                        • Physical theft of data and hardware
                                        • Physical damage to or destruction of data and hardware
                                        • Modification of the operational process
                                        • Unauthorized changes to the functional environment (e.g., data
                                             connections, unauthorized use of removable media, adding/removing
                                             resources)
                                        • Disconnection of physical data links
                                        • Undetectable interception of data (e.g., keystroke and other input
                                             logging)
  Radio frequency, electromagnetic      Some hardware used for OT systems is vulnerable to radio frequency,
  pulse (EMP), static discharge,        electromagnetic pulses (EMP), static discharge, brownouts, and voltage
  brownouts, and voltage spikes         spikes. The impacts can range from the temporary disruption of command
                                        and control to permanent damage to circuit boards. Proper shielding,
                                        grounding, power conditioning, and/or surge suppression is recommended.
  Lack of backup power                  Without backup power to critical assets, a general loss of power will shut
                                        down the OT and could create an unsafe situation. Loss of power could
                                        also lead to insecure default settings. If the program file or data is stored in
                                        volatile memory, the process may not be able to restart after a power
                                        outage without appropriate backup power.
  Loss of environmental control         The loss of environmental control (e.g., temperatures, humidity) could
                                        lead to equipment damage, such as processors overheating. Some
                                        processors will shut down to protect themselves. Others may continue to
                                        operate in a minimal capacity and produce intermittent errors, continually
                                        reboot, or become permanently inoperable.
  Unsecured physical ports              Unsecured universal serial bus (USB) and PS/2 ports could allow
                                        unauthorized connection of thumb drives or keystroke loggers.

  Improper data validation              OT software may not properly validate user inputs or received data to
                                        ensure validity. Invalid data may result in numerous vulnerabilities,

  Data flow controls are not            Data flow controls based on data characteristics are needed to restrict the
  employed                              information that is permitted between systems. These controls can prevent
                                        the exfiltration of information and illegal operations.
  Firewalls are nonexistent or          A lack of properly configured firewalls could permit unnecessary data to
  improperly configured                 pass between networks, such as control and corporate networks, thus
                                        allowing attacks and malware to spread between networks, making
                                        sensitive data susceptible to monitoring/eavesdropping, and providing
                                        individuals with unauthorized access to systems.
  Inadequate firewall and router logs   Without proper and accurate logs, it might be impossible to determine
                                        what caused a security incident to occur.
  Standard, well-documented             Adversaries that can monitor the OT network activity can use a protocol
  communication protocols are used      analyzer or other utilities to decode the data transferred by protocols, such
  in plaintext                          as telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                                        (HTTP), and Network File System (NFS). The use of such protocols also
                                        makes it easier for adversaries to perform attacks against the OT and
                                        manipulate OT network activity.
  Authentication of users, data, or     Many OT protocols have no authentication at any level. Without
  devices is substandard or             authentication, there is the potential to replay, modify, or spoof data or
  nonexistent                           devices, such as sensors and user identities.
  Use of unsecure OT protocols          OT protocols often have few or no security capabilities, such as
                                        authentication and encryption, to protect data from unauthorized access or
                                        tampering. The incorrect implementation of the protocols can also lead to
                                        additional vulnerabilities.
  Lack of integrity checking for        Integrity checks are not built into most OT protocols, so adversaries could
  communications                        manipulate communications undetected. To ensure integrity, the OT can
                                        use lower-layer protocols (e.g., IPsec) that offer data integrity protection
                                        when traversing untrusted physical media.
  Inadequate authentication between     Strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and access points is
  wireless clients and access points    needed to ensure that legitimate OT clients do not connect to a rogue
                                        access point deployed by an adversary and that adversary clients do not
                                        connect to any of the OT wireless networks.
  Inadequate data protection            Sensitive data between wireless clients and access points should be
  between wireless clients and          protected using strong encryption to ensure that adversaries cannot gain
  access points                         unauthorized access to the unencrypted data.

  Unauthorized physical access to     Physical access to sensors and final elements allows for direct
  sensors or final elements           manipulation of the physical process. Many devices are configured on a
                                      fieldbus such that physical access to the sensor network allows for
                                      manipulation of controlling parameters. Physical access to the whole of
                                      the loop should be managed to prevent incidents.

                                      systems also have the technical ability to modify the configuration of
                                      sensors and final elements, although modification may not be their
                                      primary function. The asset management system should be controlled
                                      appropriately based on its ability (or lack of ability) to manipulate the
                                      process.


C.3.    Threat Events and Incidents
A threat event is an event or situation that could potentially cause an undesirable consequence or
impact to operations resulting from some threat source. NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1]
Appendix E identifies a broad set of threat events that could potentially impact information
systems. The properties of OT may also present unique threat events, such as how the threat
events can manipulate OT processes to cause physical damage. Table 21 provides an overview
of potential OT threat events and leverages MITRE’s ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems
[ATTACK-ICS].
                                Table 21. Examples of potential threat events

            Threat Event                                               Description
  Denial of control                   Temporarily prevents operators and engineers from interfacing with
                                      process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the
                                      period of control loss but not necessarily in a desired state.
  Manipulation of control             Unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions in PLCs, RTUs,
                                      DCS, or SCADA controllers, alarm thresholds changed, or unauthorized
                                      commands issued to control equipment. These changes could potentially
                                      result in damage to equipment (if tolerances are exceeded), premature
                                      shutdown of processes (e.g., prematurely shutting down transmission
                                      lines), an environmental incident, or even disabled control equipment.
  Spoofed reporting message           False information sent to an OT system operator, either for evasion or to
                                      impair process control. The adversary could make the defenders and
                                      operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them
                                      from the actual source of the problem (i.e., alarm floods).
  Theft of operational information    Adversaries may steal operational information for personal gain or to
                                      inform future operations.

               Threat Event                                                      Description
     Loss of safety                              Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a
                                                 prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow future unsafe
                                                 conditionals to go unchecked.
     Loss of availability                        Adversaries may leverage malware to delete or encrypt critical data on
                                                 HMIs, workstations, or databases.


Numerous OT incidents have been reported and documented. Descriptions of these events help
demonstrate the severity of the threat sources, vulnerabilities, and impacts within the OT domain.
As mentioned in Appendix C.2, the four broad categories of threat sources are adversarial,
accidental, structural, and environmental. Often, the incident can be the result of multiple threat
sources (e.g., an environmental event causes a system failure, which is responded to incorrectly
by an operator and results in an accidental event).
Below is a limited selection of reported incidents that fall into each of the four categories. The
incidents have been additionally categorized into malicious or non-malicious and direct or
indirect to further distinguish the possible causes of OT incidents.
           M = Malicious. The event was initiated by someone for a harmful purpose. The initiator
           may or may not have been targeting the OT or known the potential consequences.
           N = Non-malicious. There does not appear to be evidence that the initiating event was
           intended to cause an incident.
           D = Direct. The event was designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or otherwise impact the
           OT system.
           I = Indirect. The event was not believed to be designed to discover, inhibit, impair, or
           otherwise impact the OT system. The OT system shut down or caused disruption as a
           result of impact to the supporting infrastructure.

C.3.1. Adversarial Events
      •    [M][D] Marconi wireless hack. 9 In 1903, Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi was
           preparing for his first public demonstration of long-distance secure wireless
           communications from Cornwall to Professor Fleming at the Royal Institution of London.
           Inventor and magician Nevil Maskelyne hacked the system and sent a comical message
           in Morse code referencing “rats.” Maskelyne then published an explanation of his hack in
           the trade journal The Electrician.
      •    [M][I] Worcester air traffic communications.10 In March 1997, a teenager in
           Worcester, Massachusetts, disabled part of the public switched telephone network using a
           dial-up modem connected to the system. This disabled phone service at the control tower,
           airport security, the airport fire department, the weather service, and carriers that use the
           airport. The tower’s main radio transmitter and another transmitter that activated runway
           lights were also shut down, as well as a printer that controllers used to monitor flight

          progress. The attack also disabled phone service to 600 homes and businesses in the
          nearby town of Rutland.
     •    [M][D] Maroochy Shire sewage spill. 11 In the spring of 2000, a former employee of an
          Australian organization that developed manufacturing software applied for a job with the
          local government but was rejected. Over a two-month period, the disgruntled employee
          reportedly used a radio transmitter on as many as 46 occasions to remotely break into the
          controls of a sewage treatment system. He altered electronic data for particular sewerage
          pumping stations and caused malfunctions in their operations, ultimately releasing about
          264,000 gallons of raw sewage into nearby rivers and parks.
     •    [M][I] Night Dragon. 12 McAfee reported a series of attacks that were designed to steal
          sensitive data from global oil, energy, and petrochemical industries. Adversaries
          exfiltrated proprietary operations data and project financing information with regard to
          oil and gas field bids and operations.
     •    [M][D] Iranian centrifuge, Stuxnet. 13 Stuxnet was a Microsoft Windows computer
          worm discovered in July 2010 that specifically targeted industrial software and
          equipment. The worm initially spread indiscriminately but included a highly specialized
          malware payload that was designed to only target particular SCADA systems that were
          configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes.
     •    [M][D] German steel mill attack. 14 In 2014, hackers manipulated and disrupted control
          systems to such a degree that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in
          unspecified “massive” damage.
     •    [M][I] Shamoon. 15 In 2012, Saudi Aramco experienced a malware attack that targeted
          their refineries and overwrote the attacked systems’ master boot records (MBRs),
          partition tables, and other data files. This caused the systems to become unusable.
     •    [M][D] New York dam. 16 In 2013, an Iranian computer security company obtained
          remote access to a computer that controlled the SCADA system for the Bowman Dam
          located in Rye, New York. The adversary was able to view water levels, temperature, and
          the status of the sluice gate. The sluice gate control was disconnected for maintenance at
          the time of adversarial remote access, so the dam could not be remotely controlled.
     •    [M][D] Dragonfly campaign, Havex. 17 The energy sector was targeted during a multi-
          year cyber-espionage campaign that primarily used Havex malware. Havex was a remote
          access Trojan that used the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather
          information about connected ICS devices on a network. The campaigns were exploratory.

     •    [M][D] Ukrainian power grid, BlackEnergy3. 18 On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian
          power companies experienced a cyberattack that caused power outages and impacted
          over 225,000 customers in Ukraine. Over 50 regional substations experienced malicious
          remote operation of their breakers. KillDisk malware was used to erase files on targeted
          systems, including at least one Windows-based HMI. The actors also corrupted the
          firmware of serial-to-Ethernet devices at the substations. This was the first known cyber
          attack on a power grid.
     •    [M][D] Ukrainian power grid, Industroyer. 19 On December 17, 2016, a cyber attack
          occurred at a substation outside of Kyiv, Ukraine, and resulted in an outage for customers
          of one substation for approximately one hour. This attack was the first known malware
          specifically designed to attack the power grid.
     •    [M][I] Maersk, NotPetya. In 2017, the NotPetya malware encrypted computers globally
          with no method for decryption. Although the malware initially targeted Ukrainian
          companies, it spread throughout the world with significant impacts to Maersk, FedEx,
          Merck, and Saint-Gobain. The malware destroyed data and disrupted shipping operations
          for Maersk, costing the company over $300 million in repairs and recovery efforts.
     •    [M][D] Saudi Petrochem, TRITON.20 A petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia was
          attacked using malicious software that targeted the industrial SIS. The SIS initiated a safe
          shutdown of the petrochemical process in 2017 when the triple-redundant processors
          identified mismatched code amongst the processors.
     •    [M][I] Norsk Hydro, LockerGoga. 21 In March 2019, Norsk Hydro experienced a
          cyberattack that used LockerGoga ransomware to encrypt its computer files. The
          aluminum and renewable energy company transitioned to manual operations and was
          transparent with the public on its progress to recovery. Norsk Hydro’s transparency
          throughout the discovery and recovery process is well regarded by the security industry.
     •    [M][I] Colonial Pipeline. 22 In May 2021, over 5,500 miles of pipeline transporting more
          than 100 million gallons per day of refined products to the East Coast of the U.S.
          shutdown operations because of a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline was a victim of a
          ransomware cyber attack that encrypted their IT systems by exploiting a legacy VPN
          profile. The investigation is ongoing, but at the time of this writing, there is no evidence
          that the ransomware had any direct impact on the OT environment. Colonial made the
          decision to shut down the physical operations on the pipeline to contain any potential
          damage. Colonial Pipeline also decided to pay the ransom to cybercriminal group
          Darkside in order to have all possible tools, including the decryption tools, available to

           the ransom payment. 23
     •     [M][I] Ransomware targeting healthcare. 24 A string of malware delivered via phishing
           attacks targeted the healthcare and public health sectors to disrupt services and steal data.
           In fall 2020, a CISA Alert (AA20-302A) was issued to warn healthcare and public health
           sector companies of the prevalence of these attacks.

C.3.2. Structural Events
     •     [N][D] Bellingham, Washington, gasoline pipeline failure. 25 In June 1999, 237,000
           gallons of gasoline leaked from a 16-inch pipeline and ignited 1.5 hours later, causing
           three deaths, eight injuries, and extensive property damage. The pipeline failure was
           exacerbated by control systems that were unable to perform control and monitoring
           functions. Immediately prior to and during the incident, the SCADA system exhibited
           poor performance that inhibited the pipeline controllers from seeing and reacting to the
           development of an abnormal pipeline operation. A key recommendation from the NTSB
           report issued in October 2002 was to utilize an offline development and testing system
           for implementing and testing changes to the SCADA database.
     •     [M][I] CSX train signaling system. 26 In August 2003, the Sobig computer virus was
           blamed for shutting down train signaling systems throughout the East Coast of the U.S.
           The virus infected the computer system at CSX Corp.’s Jacksonville, Florida,
           headquarters and shut down signaling, dispatching, and other systems. According to
           Amtrak spokesman Dan Stessel, 10 Amtrak trains were affected in the morning. Trains
           between Pittsburgh, PA, and Florence, South Carolina, were halted because of dark
           signals, and one regional Amtrak train from Richmond, Virginia, to Washington and New
           York was delayed for more than two hours. Long-distance trains were also delayed
           between four and six hours.
     •     [N][D] Browns Ferry-3 PLC failure. 27 In August 2006, TVA was forced to manually
           shut down one of their plant’s two reactors after unresponsive PLCs problems caused two
           water pumps to fail and threatened the stability of the plant itself. Although there were
           dual redundant PLCs, they were connected to the same Ethernet network. Later testing on
           the failed devices discovered that they would crash when they encountered excessive
           network traffic.

C.3.3. Environmental Events
     •     [N][I] Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. 28 The Great East Japan Earthquake on
           March 11, 2011, struck off the coast of Japan and sent a massive tsunami inland toward
           the nuclear plant. The tsunami compromised the plant’s seawall, flooding much of the
           plant, including the location housing the emergency generators. This emergency power
           was critical for operating the control rooms and providing coolant water for the reactors.
           The loss of coolant caused the reactor cores to overheat to the point where the fuel’s
           zirconium cladding reacted with water, releasing hydrogen gas and fueling large
           explosions in three of the four reactor buildings. This resulted in large-scale radiation
           leakage that has impacted plant employees, nearby citizens, and the local environment.
           Post-event analysis found that the plant’s emergency response center had insufficient
           secure communication lines to provide other areas of the plant with information on key
           safety-related instrumentation.

C.3.4. Accidental Events
     •     [N][D] Vulnerability scanner incidents. 29 While a ping sweep was being performed on
           an active SCADA network that controlled 9-foot robotic arms, one arm became active
           and swung around 180 degrees. The controller for the arm was in standby mode before
           the ping sweep was initiated. In a separate incident, a ping sweep was being performed
           on an ICS network to identify the hosts that were attached to the network for inventory
           purposes, and it caused a system that controlled the creation of integrated circuits in the
           fabrication plant to hang. This test resulted in the destruction of $50,000 worth of wafers.
     •     [N][D] Penetration testing incident.30 A natural gas utility hired an IT security
           consulting organization to conduct penetration testing on its corporate IT network. The
           consulting organization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was directly
           connected to the SCADA system. The penetration test locked up the SCADA system, and
           the utility was not able to send gas through its pipelines for four hours.
     •     [N][I] NERC Enforcement Action. 31 In 2019, a U.S. energy company was fined $10
           million by NERC for cybersecurity violations that took place between 2015 and 2018.
           The inability to comply with U.S. standards for cybersecurity was seen as a risk to the
           security and reliability of the overall power system.
     •     [N][D] NASA fire. 32 A security patch was applied to an OT component that controlled a
           large engineering oven. The patch and associated reboot caused the oven to stop running,
           which led to a fire that destroyed the spacecraft hardware. The reboot also impeded alarm
           activation, which allowed the fire to go undetected for 3.5 hours before discovery.

        •    [N][D] Hatch Nuclear Power Plant. 33 In 2008, the Hatch nuclear power plant in
             Georgia was forced into an emergency shutdown for forty-eight hours after a software
             update was installed on a single Windows computer. When the updated computer
             rebooted, it reset the data on the control system, causing safety systems to errantly
             interpret the lack of data as a drop in water reservoirs that cool the plant’s
             radioactive nuclear fuel rods. As a result, automated safety systems at the plant
             triggered a shutdown.

Appendix E. OT Security Capabilities and Tools
This appendix provides an overview of key security technologies that are available to or being
developed to support the OT community. There are several security products that are marketed
specifically for OT, while others are general IT security products that are also applicable to OT.
Many cybersecurity products are marketed as a single platform that combines the capabilities
and tools listed here. Each organization should make a risk-based determination on whether to
employ the security technologies and tools mentioned in this appendix.

E.1.   Network Segmentation and Isolation
Network segmentation and separation technologies allow OT network owners to implement
cybersecurity strategies that isolate devices and network traffic by both physical and logical
means. Popular tooling for this capability area is described below.

E.1.1. Firewalls
Firewalls can be used to logically enforce user-defined rule sets on network traffic. Commonly
placed at network boundaries, firewalls can limit both incoming and outgoing traffic based on a
variety of data characteristics.
There are several types of general IT firewalls. Basic packet filtering firewalls directly inspect
current network traffic at OSI Layers 3 and 4 to inform decisions on whether to drop or forward
packets to their destination. Conversely, stateful inspection firewalls draw upon the memory of
both past and present network connections when making filtering decisions, thereby offering
more capabilities at an increased computational cost. Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) expand
upon stateful inspection firewalls by adding features such as application filtering, deep packet
inspection, VPN traffic awareness, adaptive rules, and threat detection.
Several vendors also offer OT-specific firewalls with unique feature sets. For example, they
often provide built-in parsers for common OT protocols, such as DNP3, CIP, and Modbus,
allowing for deep packet inspection of OT traffic.

E.1.2. Unidirectional Gateways
Unidirectional gateways, also referred to as data diodes, are designed to only allow data
transmission in a single direction. Unlike a firewall, data diodes cannot be programmed to allow
data to flow in both directions because the hardware is incapable. A common use case is placing
a data diode at the boundary between the operational network and the enterprise network. The
data diode would allow network traffic to leave the operational network but not enter, preventing
a potential avenue of cyber attack.

E.1.3. Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)
A VLAN can be used to logically separate areas within a network when physical separation may
not be feasible due to cost or other prohibitive measures. VLANs are implemented on modern
network switching equipment that logically separates network traffic based on switch ports. For
example, an 8-port switch can be configured to separate traffic into two VLANs. One VLAN

would be provided for ports 1-4, while another would be provided for ports 5-8. While all eight
ports are physically connected to a single device, each port is only logically connected to the
other ports within its VLAN.

E.1.4. Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Traditional networking switches are responsible for both forwarding packets (data plane) and
running the distributed algorithms that determine routing (control plane). SDN is a technology
that evolves this concept by keeping the data plane at the switch and moving the control plane to
a centralized controller. The centralized controller acts as an abstraction layer for network
programmability, eliminating the need to individually manage each switch within the network.
SDN allows for easy dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane, which can in turn allow for the
quick isolation of devices or redirection and duplication of traffic for monitoring and data
capture. Utilizing SDN technology within an OT environment gives asset owners greater
flexibility when initially designing their network architectures and when updating them in the
future.

E.2.   Network Monitoring – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Network monitoring technologies allow OT network owners to maintain situational awareness of
their controlled processes and support cybersecurity objectives, such as event or anomaly
detection. OT vendors often market their network monitoring technology as being capable of
integrating with SIEM technologies. These systems collect data through log aggregation and
network scanning tools, detect threats through analytics, and can provide automated incident
response. Capabilities continue to be added, including the use of ML and AI to improve
detection and reduce unnecessary alerts. OT owners must exercise caution when implementing
these technologies as they can directly impact the availability of the controlled process.

E.2.1. Centralized Logging
System and network logs from all sources in an environment are the foundation of SIEM. Logs
act as the primary historical artifact for incident response. When aggregated at a central location,
logs can be analyzed together to provide a holistic view of the network state. A SIEM will utilize
a variety of sensors strategically placed within a target network to collect logs from endpoints
and network traffic information, which are then stored in a database for real-time analysis.
Specific to OT networks, data historians can serve as a supplemental source of event data to
provide greater context surrounding a cyber incident.

E.2.2. Passive Scanning
Passive network scans are a form of network discovery that inspects existing network traffic by
watching traffic passing through network switches or other dedicated network capture devices.
Systems that implement passive network scans do not introduce any additional traffic to the
network, which is ideal for sensitive devices found on OT networks that may exhibit unexpected
behavior when directly probed. Passive scanning can identify all of the devices that are actively
communicating on monitored network segments. Through the inspection of network data,


                                                208
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

passive scanning can identify significant amounts of information about devices, potentially
including manufacturers, part numbers, and firmware versions. Passive scanning cannot identify
devices that are not actively communicating, nor can it inspect encrypted traffic (without special
provisioning). Additionally, a passive scan will often take days to complete due to its
dependence on existing network traffic.

E.2.3. Active Scanning
Active network scans are a form of network discovery that directly probe the network for
attached devices. Systems that employ active scanning introduce traffic to the network and will
directly interact with the devices within the scan’s scope. OT network owners should exercise
extreme caution when permitting active scanning on an operational network due to device
sensitivity on the target network. Active scans may cause device instability or interfere with the
device process state, potentially impacting safety and integrity. Active scans should be scheduled
to occur during planned OT outages whenever possible.

Some OT-specific scanning devices combine passive and active scanning to enable a safer
version of active scanning. Safe active scanning first learns about connected equipment through
passive means and then uses device-specific communication to actively gain additional
information about connected equipment without risk to OT operations.

E.2.4. Malware Detection
Endpoint malware detection can be bolstered with antivirus software. Antivirus software
monitors activity on the host device and alerts the user to possible malicious activities. Older
detection techniques rely on file signatures to detect known threats. Over time, malware
developers have found ways to bypass this mechanism, such as with polymorphic code. Modern
antivirus software uses behavioral analysis of running processes and advanced file analysis to
detect potentially malicious activity.
Host-based malware detection with antivirus software may not be advisable for some OT
endpoints due to OS incompatibility, software incompatibility, or runtime requirements.
However, network-based malware detection can still be utilized. Unlike host-based antivirus
software, network-based malware detection runs on an independent system that aggregates and
inspects network traffic for anomalies. Network-based malware detection offers similar
capabilities to host-based detection without the computational overhead being placed on the
defended component. Network-based detection is a primary component of SIEM packages.

E.2.5. Behavioral Anomaly Detection
Behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) systems compare the current state of an environment with
a baseline to detect abnormal activity for further investigation. This could be unusual network
traffic, such as large amounts of data being transferred, new ports or protocols, or new
connections between devices. Unusual activity on an endpoint may include excessive processor
usage, logins outside of work hours, or new processes. The detectable events are dependent on
the sensor capabilities of the specific implementation. Some BAD systems utilize AI and ML
algorithms to automatically update the baseline model. By automating this process, the BAD


                                               209

September 2023

system can maintain knowledge of normal activity even as the environment evolves over time.
This ultimately reduces false positive detections and improves incident response capabilities.

E.2.6. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
DLP is a collection of tools built to improve the confidentiality of sensitive data on a network.
DLP is often marketed as a feature set within SIEM that actively monitors both data at rest to
prevent unauthorized access and data in transit to prevent unauthorized extraction. Even if DLP
is unable to prevent the data loss, it can still alert the organization to a breach.

E.2.7. Deception Technology
A deception technology uses decoy data and/or devices placed across the network to lure
attackers away from legitimate assets. Decoys can range from access credentials and files to
complete endpoints. When a threat actor interacts with a decoy, it triggers an alarm to alert cyber
defenders to its presence. Defenders can then choose to further monitor the adversary for
intelligence or immediately mitigate the threat. Because decoys do not actively interact with
other network components, deception technologies can support malicious activity monitoring
and detection without jeopardizing the controlled process.

E.2.8. Digital Twins
A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical system or component that can be deployed within
OT environments as a tool for anomaly detection. The digital twin utilizes real-time sensor
inputs and compares them using heuristics and algorithms (including ML) against a baseline
model. Operational anomalies detected by digital twins most often indicate a maintenance or
failure situation. However, a detected operational anomaly could indicate an advanced cyber
attack that has bypassed other security mechanisms and would otherwise have gone undetected.

E.3.   Data Security
Various data security technologies assist information owners in protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of their data. OT network owners are encouraged to identify the critical
files and data that reside in their networks and implement data security technologies to mitigate
risk.

E.3.1. Backup Storage
Backup storage is an alternative file storage location where copies of critical files are stored and
protected to assist with recovery should the originals be lost, compromised, or unusable. Using
backup tools and procedures is fundamental to ensuring the availability of critical data within an
OT network environment. Based on risk, backup plans should specify which files require
backup, how often they should be backed up, the number of copies to be made, the location of
the backup (e.g., offline, off-site) and how long backup copies should be kept. Various solutions
exist to automate backup storage of critical data on a regular basis.



                                                210

September 2023

E.3.2. Immutable Storage
Immutable storage is a special type of backup storage that provides additional data integrity
through data storage in a read-only format. Immutable storage can be used to store backups of
programs or device configurations. It can also be used as a read-only drive in a maintenance
workstation for added protection against the installation of new software.

E.3.3. File Hashing
The integrity of critical files such as program logic can be validated by using hashes. A hashing
algorithm calculates a fixed-size string from a file’s contents. If a hash is calculated and stored
for a critical file when it is first created, the integrity of the file can be checked later by
calculating the hash again. For example, if an end user needs to restore functionality to a device
by returning it to a baseline, the integrity of the baseline files can first be validated by
recomputing the file hash. If a different hash is calculated for a target file, the data owner can
assume that the backup files have been compromised. Many data backup software systems
include hashing within their feature set. NIST-approved hash algorithms are specified in FIPS
180-4, Secure Hash Standard [FIPS180], and FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard [FIPS202].

E.3.4. Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are an additional data integrity measure. They are the electronic analogue of a
written signature and provide assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information and
that the information was not modified following signature. FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) [FIPS186], specifies three NIST-approved digital signature algorithms: DSA,
RSA, and ECDSA.

E.3.5. Block Ciphers
Asset owners can protect the confidentiality of data at rest using block ciphers. Block ciphers are
algorithms that encrypt data in block-sized chunks rather than one bit at a time. This is beneficial
when encrypting large amounts of data at once. NIST-approved block ciphers are the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES is specified in
FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197]. Triple DES is specified in NIST SP 800-
67, Rev. 2, Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Block Cipher [SP800-
67r2].

E.3.6. Remote Access
Security controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized remote access to an
organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network (VPN) is a set of
technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network environments. A
VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure communication data by
establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public infrastructure. The most
common types of VPN technologies are:
   •   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and
       tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while
       leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to
       each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side,
       an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet. See NIST SP 800-77, Rev. 1, Guide to
       IPsec VPNs for more information.
   •   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of
       Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that
       encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP
       traffic in a protocol implementation known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is
       not limited to HTTP traffic and can be used to secure many application-layer programs.
       For more information, see NIST SP 800-52, Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection,
       Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.
   •   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining
       access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely
       control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application, is
       included in most UNIX distributions, and is typically added to other platforms through a
       third-party package.
When implemented with diligence, remote access technologies can improve an organization’s
capabilities. There are several options for remote access and desktop control, including the
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), screens, and other stand-alone packages. If remote
technologies are not managed properly using vulnerability and patch management, these
connections can serve as another channel for an adversary to exploit.

Appendix F. OT Overlay
            Note to Readers
            The OT overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines
            in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 and adds supplementary guidance specific to
            OT. The concept of overlays is discussed in Appendix C of NIST SP
            800-53B. The OT overlay is intended to be applicable to all OT systems
            in all industrial sectors. Further tailoring can add specificity to a
            particular sector (e.g., pipeline, energy). Ultimately, an overlay may be
            produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ company).
            This OT overlay constitutes supplemental guidance and tailoring for
            NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. Duplicating Appendix F of NIST SP 800-53
            would increase the size of this publication significantly, so it is not
            included here.
            The authoring team also considered that this OT overlay may serve as a
            model for other overlays. Feedback on this appendix’s structure would
            be appreciated, especially on the level of abstraction and whether the
            examples provided in the supplemental guidance are sufficient and
            beneficial for implementation.
Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor control baselines and develop
specialized security plans that can be applied to specific mission and business functions,
environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the
number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and
organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific protection needs
within defined risk tolerances.
A repository of overlays may be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-
53-controls/overlay-repository. This overlay may be referenced as the NIST SP 800-82, Rev. 3
Operational Technology Overlay (“NIST SP 800-82 Rev 3 OT Overlay”). It is based on NIST SP
800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5].
NIST developed this overlay in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 (Public Law 113-283) [FISMA],
Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) [PPD-21], and Executive Order 13636 [EO13636].
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.

F.1.   Overlay Characteristics
OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the
physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These
systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of
devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation



                                                213

systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment
monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.
ICS consists of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic,
pneumatic) that act together to achieve an objective (e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter
or energy). The part of the system primarily concerned with producing an output is referred to as
the process. The control part of the system includes the specification of the desired output or
performance. Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop.
Section 2 provides an overview of various OT systems, such as SCADA, DCS, PLCs, BASs,
PACSs, and IIoT.

F.2.   Applicability
The purpose of this overlay is to provide guidance for securing OT systems. This overlay has
been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental organizations on
a voluntary basis.
Privacy is a risk consideration for OT systems. For additional guidance, refer to the NIST
Privacy Framework [PF]. The application of privacy in OT will depend on sector and
organizational risks, so controls that are exclusively related to privacy have not been included in
this OT overlay. Each organization will need to independently determine applicability. All
controls and control enhancements that only appear in the privacy baseline have been removed
from this OT overlay according to this rationale.

F.3.   Overlay Summary
Table 22 provides a summary of the controls and control enhancements from NIST SP 800-53,
Rev. 5, Appendix F [SP800-53r5] that have been allocated to the initial control baselines (i.e.,
Low, Moderate, and High) along with indications of OT discussion and OT tailoring. The table
uses the following conventions:
   •   Bold indicates controls and control enhancements with OT discussions.
   •   Underline indicates that this overlay has added a control to the baseline that is
       supplemental to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B.
   •   Strikethrough indicates that a control or control enhancement has been removed from this
       baseline compared to the baselines provided in NIST SP 800-53B.
In the following example, OT discussion was added to Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4
(bolded). In addition, Control Enhancement 1 of AU-4 was added to the Low, Moderate (Mod),
and High baselines (underlined), compared with the NIST 800-53B baseline, which did not
include AU-4 Control Enhancement 1.
        AU-4   Audit Storage Capacity                 AU-4 (1)       AU-4 (1)        AU-4 (1)

Some controls and control enhancements are useful to many OT environments but are not
applicable across all OT sectors or architectures. Such controls may have additional OT
discussion. These will appear in the individual control tables. Controls and control enhancements
without baselines are not included in Table 22.

F.4.      Tailoring Considerations
The OT overlay in this publication leverages the NIST SP 800-53B control baselines that
account for the unique characteristics of OT systems, such as an increased need for availability,
safety, and environmental or operating environment considerations. Additionally, OT systems
vary widely in their architecture and technology selection. The NIST SP 800-53B control
baselines were tailored for these general considerations, including the addition of controls
relevant for OT environments. Organizations can use this overlay as a starting point and further
tailor controls to meet specific operational needs to address the variability of OT systems.
As organizations further tailor controls to meet their internal security requirements, limitations
(e.g., technology, operational constraints, environmental considerations) may necessitate the


                                                        223
NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

selection of compensating controls. Compensating controls in the OT environment may be
required when the OT cannot support certain controls or control enhancements or when the
organization determines that it is not advisable to implement controls or control enhancements
due to potential adverse impacts to performance, safety, or reliability. Compensating controls are
alternatives to a specific baseline control or enhancement that provides equivalent or comparable
protection. For example, if controls or control enhancements require automated mechanisms that
are not readily available, cost-effective, or technically feasible in OT environments,
compensating controls implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures may be
acceptable to meet the intent of the control.
Compensating controls implemented in accordance with PL-11 from SP 800-53, Rev. 5 are not
considered exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls. Rather, they are alternative safeguards
and countermeasures employed within the OT environment that accomplish the intent of the
original controls that could not be effectively employed. See “Control Tailoring” in Section 3.3
of NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2].
Using compensating controls may also include control enhancements that supplement the
baseline. Using compensating controls typically involves a trade-off between additional risk and
reduced functionality. Every use of compensating controls should involve a risk-based
determination of how much residual risk to accept and how much functionality to reduce.
Additionally, when compensating controls are employed, organizations should document the
rationale and describe:
   •   Why the baseline control could not be implemented
   •   How the compensating controls provide equivalent security capabilities for OT systems
   •   The risk acceptance for any residual risk that results from using the compensating
       controls instead of the baseline control
Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security
plan for the OT.
Controls that contain assignments (e.g., Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger
events) may be tailored out of the baseline. This is equivalent to assigning a value of “none.” The
assignment may take on different values for different impact baselines.

F.5.   OT Communication Protocols
The unique network properties within OT may warrant specific attention when applying certain
controls. Many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that pertain to communication,
devices, and interfaces implicitly assume the applicability of network routing or communication
between network segments or zones. Some devices or subsystems used in OT may be configured
or architected in a way that may create an exception to this assumption. As a result, controls for
devices that communicate using standards and protocols that do not include network addressing
generally require tailoring. An RS-232 (serial) interface is an example of a non-network
addressable or routable communication method that is commonly employed in OT equipment.

F.7.   Detailed Overlay Control Specifications
This overlay is based on NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information
Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5], which provides a catalog of security and privacy
controls, and NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations
[SP800-53B]. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide
process that manages security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and
privacy requirements across the Federal Government and critical infrastructure and are derived
from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and mission and
business needs. The documents also describe how to develop specialized sets of controls or
overlays that are tailored for specific types of mission and business functions, technologies, or
environments of operation. Finally, the catalog controls address security from both a
functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of security and privacy functions and mechanisms
provided) and an assurance perspective (i.e., the measures of confidence in the implemented
capability). Addressing both functionality and assurance helps to ensure that component products
and the systems built from those products use sound system and security engineering principles
and are sufficiently trustworthy.
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate controls for organizational systems
and their respective environments of operation, organizations should first determine the
criticality and sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those
systems. This process is known as security categorization. FIPS 199 [FIPS199] enables federal
agencies to establish security categories for both information and information systems. Other
documents, such as those produced by ISA and CNSS, also provide guidance for defining low,
moderate, and high levels of security based on impact. The security categories are based on the
potential impact on an organization or on people (i.e., employees and/or the public) should
certain events occur that jeopardize the information and systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, such as protecting its assets, fulfilling its legal responsibilities,
maintaining its day-to-day functions, and protecting individuals’ safety, health, and life. Security
categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information to assess the
risk to an organization.
This overlay provides OT Discussions for the controls and control enhancements prescribed for a
system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its
data and to meet a set of defined security requirements. Discussions for all controls and control
enhancements in Section 3 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 should be used in conjunction with the
OT Discussions in this overlay. This overlay contains a tailoring of the control baselines, and its
specification may be more stringent or less stringent than the original control baseline
specification. It is high-level, applicable to all OT environments, can be applied to multiple
systems, and may be used as the basis for more specific overlays. Use cases for specific systems
in specific environments may be separately published (e.g., as a NIST IR).

       ➑ OT Discussion: The organization ensures that access enforcement mechanisms do not
       adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. Example compensating controls
       include encapsulation. The policy for logical access control to non-addressable and non-
       routable system resources and the associated information is made explicit. Access control
       mechanisms include hardware, firmware, and software that control the device or have
       device access, such as device drivers and communications controllers. Physical access
       control may serve as a compensating control for logical access control. However, it may
       not provide sufficient granularity when users require access to different functions.
       ➒ Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: The organization identifies and restricts
       access to information that could impact the OT environment and accounts for
       information types that are sensitive, proprietary, contain trade secrets, or support safety
       functions.
       ➓ Rationale for adding AC-3 (11) to HIGH baseline: The loss of availability, integrity,
       and confidentiality of certain types of information that reside on a high-impact OT
       system may result in severe or catastrophic adverse effects on operations, assets, or
       individuals, including severe degradation or loss of mission capability, major damage to
       organizational assets, or harm to individuals involving the loss of life or life-threatening
       injuries.

F.7.1. ACCESS CONTROL – AC
Tailoring Considerations for the Access Control Family
Before implementing controls in the AC family, consider the trade-offs among security, privacy,
latency, performance, throughput, and reliability. For example, the organization considers
whether latency induced from the use of confidentiality and integrity mechanisms that employ
cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the operational performance of the OT.
When the OT cannot support the specific access control requirements of a control, the
organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.

OT Discussion: The policy specifically addresses the unique properties and requirements of OT
and the relationship to non-OT systems. OT access by vendors and maintenance staff can occur
over a large facility footprint or geographic area and into unobserved spaces, such as mechanical
or electrical rooms, ceilings, floors, field substations, switch and valve vaults, and pump stations.

Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: When the OT (e.g., field devices) cannot support
temporary or emergency accounts, this enhancement does not apply. Example compensating
controls include employing nonautomated mechanisms or procedures.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: This control enhancement defines situations or
timeframes in which users log out of accounts in the policy. Automatic enforcement is not
addressed by this control enhancement. Organizations determine whether this control
enhancement is appropriate for the mission and/or functions of the OT system and define the
timeframe or scenarios. If no timeframe or scenarios apply, the organization-defined parameter
reflects as much.
Control Enhancement: (11) (12) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (13) OT Discussion: Close coordination occurs between OT, HR, IT, and
physical security personnel to ensure the timely removal of high-risk individuals.

            ENCRYPTED INFORMATION

OT Discussion: Information flow policy may be achieved using a combination of logical and
physical flow restriction techniques. The inspection of message content may enforce information
flow policy. For example, industrial OT protocols may be restricted using inbound and outbound
traffic rules on a network control device between OT and IT networks. For non-routable
communication, such as serial connections, devices may be configured to limit commands to and
from specific tags within the OT device. The information flow policy may be supported by
labeling or coloring physical connectors to aid in connecting networks. Devices that do not have
a business need to communicate should not be connected (i.e., air gapped).
Control Enhancement: (4) No OT discussion for this control.

operator response is required in emergency situations. Example compensating controls include
locating the display in an area with physical access controls that limit access to individuals with
permission and need-to-know for the displayed information.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Physical protection may be employed to prevent
access to a display or the attachment of a display. When the OT cannot conceal displayed
information, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as
compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include employing
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls. Compensating controls
could include limiting remote access to a specified period of time or placing a call from the OT
site to the authenticated remote entity.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: Encryption-based technologies should be used to
support the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. While OT devices often lack
the ability to support modern encryption, additional devices (e.g., VPNs) can be added to support
these features. This control should not be confused with SC-8 – Transmission Confidentiality
and Integrity, which discusses confidentiality and integrity requirements for general
communications, including between OT devices.
Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include connection-
specific manual authentication of the remote entity.
Control Enhancement: (4) (10) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (9) OT Discussion: Implementation of the remote access disconnect
should not impact OT operations. OT personnel should be trained on how to use the remote
access disconnect.
Rationale for adding AC-17 (9) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: As more OT systems
become accessible remotely, the capability to disconnect or disable remote access is critical to
managing risk and may be required to provide stable and safe operations.
Rationale for adding AC-17 (10) to MOD and HIGH baselines: The ability to authenticate
remote commands is important to prevent unauthorized commands that may have immediate or
serious consequences, such as injury, death, property damage, the loss of high-value assets, the
failure of mission or business functions, or compromise of sensitive information.

(5) to reduce the boundary of wireless access.
Control Enhancement: (3) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (5) Availability and interference for wireless signals may be a concern
within OT environments. Antennas and power levels should be designed to overcome and
achieve availability goals. Where confidentiality is concerned, antennas and power levels can
also be designed to minimize signal exposure outside of the facility.

OT Discussion: Organizations refine the definition of “external” to reflect lines of authority and
responsibility, the granularity of an organization entity, and their relationships. An organization
may consider a system to be external if that system performs different functions, implements
different policies, falls under different management authorities, or does not provide sufficient
visibility into the implementation of controls to allow the establishment of a satisfactory trust
relationship. For example, an OT system and a business data processing system may be
considered external to each other depending on the organization’s system boundaries.
Access to an OT for support by a business partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is
another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of external systems is reexamined
with respect to OT functions, purposes, technology, and limitations to establish a clearly
documented technical or business case for use and an acceptance of the risk inherent in the use of
an external system.

F.7.3. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTABILITY – AU
Tailoring Considerations for the Audit Family
In general, security audit information and audit tools are not available on legacy OT. When OT
cannot support the specific audit and accountability requirements of a control, the organization
employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. For example,
organizations may want to consider whether security audit information is available from separate
systems or system components (e.g., the historian, firewall logs, physical security systems).
Additional examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.

the OT security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
associated with a particular facility and/or process. The organization ensures that the assessment
does not affect system operation or result in unintentional system modification. If assessment
activities must be performed on the production OT, it may need to be taken offline before an
assessment can be conducted, or the assessment should be scheduled to occur during planned OT
outages whenever possible.

be connected to other systems. The authorizing official (AO) fully understands the organizational
information security policies and procedures; the OT security policies and procedures; the risks

associated with the connection to other systems; the individuals and organizations that operate
and maintain the systems, including maintenance contractors or service providers; and the
specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular interconnection.
Connections from the OT environment to other security zones may cross the authorization
boundary such that two different authorizing officials may be required to approve the connection.

OT Discussion: Continuous monitoring programs for OT are designed, documented, and
implemented with input from OT personnel. The organization ensures that continuous
monitoring does not interfere with OT functions. The individual or group designing and
conducting the continuous monitoring for the OT systems implements a monitoring program that
is consistent with the organizational information security policies and procedures, the OT
security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
associated with a particular facility and/or process. Continuous monitoring can be automated or
manual at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. For example, the organization
may monitor event logs manually on a specified frequency less often for lower-risk, isolated
systems than for higher-risk, networked systems.

            AGENT OR TEAM

OT Discussion: Penetration testing is used with care on OT networks to ensure that OT functions
are not adversely impacted by the testing process. In general, OT systems are highly sensitive to
timing constraints and have limited resources. Example compensating controls include
employing a replicated, virtualized, or simulated system to conduct penetration testing.
Production OT may need to be taken offline before testing can be conducted. If OT systems are
taken offline for testing, tests are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever
possible. If penetration testing is performed on non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure
that tests do not propagate into the OT network.

Rationale for removing CA-8 (1) from HIGH baseline: Specific expertise is necessary to conduct
effective penetration testing on OT systems, and it may not be feasible to identify independent
personnel with the appropriate skillset or knowledge to perform penetration testing on an OT
environment. While an independent penetration test agent or team is recommended, it may not be
feasible for all high-impact OT systems.

OT Discussion: Organizations perform risk-benefit analysis to determine whether OT equipment
should be connected to other internal system components and then document those connections.
The AO fully understands the potential risks associated with approving individual connections or
approving a class of components to be connected. For example, the AO may broadly approve the
connection of any sensors limited to 4 to 20 milliamp (mA) communication, while other
connection types (e.g., serial or Ethernet) require individual approval. Decisions to accept risk
are documented.

F.7.5. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT – CM
Tailoring Considerations for the Configuration Management Family
When the OT cannot be configured to restrict the use of unnecessary functions or cannot support
the use of automated mechanisms to implement configuration management functions, the
organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
accordance with the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given
with each control as appropriate.

OT Discussion: Configuration change control procedures should align with the organization’s
management of change practices.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) (4) (6) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (7) OT Discussion: The organization considers OT-specific requirements
when determining the frequency and/or circumstances for reviewing system changes. For
example, safety instrumented systems may be justified for the review of system changes on a
predetermined frequency to ensure that no inadvertent changes have been made to the logic
solver portion of a safety instrumented function.
Control Enhancement: (8) OT Discussion: The organization prevents or restricts configuration
changes based on a risk determination that the system should not be modified without additional
permission. For example, some PLCs have physical key switches that are used to place the PLC
in a mode that allows for programming changes. Physical key switches can restrict configuration
changes so that physical access is required to make a modification to the system.

F.7.6. CONTINGENCY PLANNING – CP
Tailoring Considerations for the Contingency Planning Family
OT systems often contain a physical component at a fixed location that may not be relocated
logically, and some replacement components may not be readily available. The continuance of
essential mission and business functions with little or no loss of operational continuity may not

Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: Testing for reliability and integrity increases
confidence that the system can be restored after an incident and minimizes the impact associated
with downtime and outages. The ability to test backups is often dependent on the resources
needed to appropriately represent the environment, such as the availability of spare devices and
testing equipment. Testing backup and restoration on OT is often limited to systems with
redundancy or spare equipment. In certain cases, sampling will be limited to those redundant
systems. Compensating controls may include alternative methods for testing backups, such as
hash or checksum validations.

OT Discussion: Reconstitution of the OT includes considering whether system state variables
should be restored to initial values or the values before disruption (e.g., are valves restored to full
open, full closed, or settings prior to disruption). Restoring system state variables may be
disruptive to ongoing physical processes (e.g., valves initially closed may adversely affect
system cooling).
Control Enhancement: (2) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (6) OT Discussion: Organizations should consider recovery and
reconstitution timeframes when storing spare equipment, including environmental hazards that
could damage the equipment. Storage locations and environments should be chosen
appropriately for the type of backup equipment.
Rationale for adding CP-10 (6) to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT system components stored
without protection against environmental threats and unauthorized physical or logical access can
be susceptible to compromise or damage. Certain system components may include embedded
electronics that must be protected from environmental hazards.

F.7.7. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION – IA
Tailoring Considerations for the Identification and Authentication Family
Before implementing controls in the IA family, consider the trade-offs among security, privacy,
latency, performance, and throughput. For example, the organization considers whether latency
induced from the use of authentication mechanisms that employ cryptography would adversely
impact the operational performance of the OT.
When the OT cannot support the specific identification and authentication requirements of a
control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring

             CREDENTIALS

OT Discussion: When shared accounts are required, compensating controls include providing
increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing measures. For certain OT, the
capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions for OT are not
hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these systems may be
restricted by appropriate physical controls.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: As a compensating control, physical access
restrictions may sufficiently represent one authentication factor, provided that the system is not
remotely accessible.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: For local access, physical access controls and logging
may be used as an alternative to individual authentication on an OT system. For remote access,

the remote access authentication mechanism will be used to identify, permit, and log individual
access before permitting the use of shared accounts.
Control Enhancement: (8) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (12) OT Discussion: The acceptance of PIV credentials is only required
for federal organizations, as defined by OMB Memorandum M-19-17 [OMB-M1917]. Non-
federal organizations should refer to IA-2 (1) (2) for guidance on multi-factor authentication
credentials. Furthermore, many OT systems do not have the ability to accept PIV credentials and
will require compensating controls.

OT Discussion: OT devices may not inherently support device authentication. If devices are local
to one another, physical security measures that prevent unauthorized communication between
devices can be used as compensating controls. For remote communication, additional hardware
may be required to meet authentication requirements.
Control Enhancement: (1) (4) OT Discussion: For OT systems that include IIoT devices, these
enhancements may be needed to protect device-to-device communication.
Rationale for adding IA-3 to LOW baseline: Given the variety of OT devices and physical
locations of OT devices, organizations may consider whether OT devices that may be vulnerable
to tampering or spoofing require unique identification and authentication and for what types of
connections.

Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: This control enhancement is typically implemented by
the organization rather than at the system level. However, to manage risk for certain OT
environments, identifiers (e.g., badges) may have different markings to indicate the status of
individuals, such as contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational users.

OT Discussion: Identity proofing is likely performed by different departments within the
organization. Existing organizational systems (e.g., HR or IT processes) should be leveraged to
perform this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Maintenance, engineering, or third-party
organizations may require OT access in order to support operations. The organization should
determine the AO for proving identity prior to allowing access to the OT environment. Consider
obtaining supervisor or sponsor authorization, where the sponsor may be someone within
operations.
Control Enhancement: (2) (3) (4) (5) OT Discussion: If the organization already performs these
controls, existing organizational processes should be leveraged. For example, HR may provide a
system for tracking identity evidence. OT does not need to develop an independent system for
achieving this control.

Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (3) OT Discussion: The organization may need access to nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic services in order to restore essential OT operations or services.
Example compensating controls include limiting the extent of the maintenance and diagnostic
services to the minimum essential activities and carefully monitoring and auditing the nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic activities.

OT Discussion: Organizations identify OT systems and system components with specific
calibration, maintenance, or other requirements and limit maintenance to specific facilities. Some
examples may include safety-critical systems or systems involved in custody transfer where
accuracy tolerances are limited and additional quality control checks are required.
Rationale for adding MA-7 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Some OT equipment have
specific requirements for calibration, maintenance, and modification to meet regulatory or safety
standards. Different deployed locations may impact the quality and precision of field
maintenance.

F.7.11.        PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION – PE
Tailoring Considerations for the Physical and Environmental Protection Family
Physical and environmental protections are often used as a compensating control for many OT
systems, so physical and environmental protection controls are especially important. Any
selected compensating control mitigates risk to an acceptable level.

PE-1    POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                                                                       CONTROL BASELINES

and the relationship to non-OT systems. The OT components can be distributed over a large
facility footprint or geographic area and can be an entry point into the entire organizational
network OT. Regulatory controls may also apply.

OT Discussion: The organization considers OT safety and security interdependencies and access
requirements in emergency situations. During an emergency, the organization may restrict access
to OT facilities and assets to authorized individuals only. OT systems are often constructed of
devices that do not have or cannot use comprehensive access control capabilities due to time-
restrictive safety constraints. Physical access controls and defense-in-depth measures are used by
the organization when necessary and possible to supplement OT security when electronic
mechanisms are unable to fulfill the security requirements of the organization’s security plan.

Rationale for adding PE-6 (4) to MOD baseline: Many of the OT components are in remote
geographical and dispersed locations. Other components may be in ceilings, floors, or
distribution closets. Furthermore, physical access controls are frequently used as compensating
controls when devices lack the ability to enforce logical access restrictions.

OT Discussion: Temperature and humidity controls are typically components of other OT
systems (e.g., HVAC, process, or lighting systems) or can be a stand-alone and unique OT
system. OT can operate in extreme environments and both interior and exterior locations. For a
specific OT, the temperature and humidity design and operational parameters dictate the
performance specifications. Power circuits, distribution closets, routers, and switches that
support fire protection and life safety systems must be maintained at the proper temperature and
humidity. When environmental controls cannot be implemented, use hardware that is engineered
to withstand the OT’s unique environmental hazards.

OT Discussion: Water damage protection and the use of shutoff and isolation valves are
procedural actions and specific types of OT. OT used in the manufacturing, hydropower,
transportation/navigation, water, and wastewater industries rely on the movement of water and
are specifically designed to manage the quantity, flow, and pressure of water. Power circuits,
distribution closets, routers, and switches that support fire protection and life safety systems
should ensure that water will not disable the system (e.g., a fire that activates the sprinkler
system does not spray onto the fire control servers, routers, or switches or short out the alarms,
egress systems, emergency lighting, or suppression systems).
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.

OT Discussion: Hardware components are marked or labeled to indicate information that is
processed, stored, or transmitted. Component markings can be useful for differentiating between
safety and control systems, OT and IT equipment, and internally and externally connected
systems. Marking components reduces the probability of mismanaging the system or performing
maintenance on an incorrect device.

September 2023

Rationale for adding PE-22 to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT is unique in that it may look like
an IT component but perform a very different function. Visible differentiation between
components that perform different functions can help reduce reliability incidents due to
maintenance errors.

F.7.13.  ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM
   MANAGEMENT CONTROLS – PM
Characteristics of the Organization-Wide Information Security Program Management
Control Family
Organization-wide information security program management controls are deployed to support
the information security program. They are not associated with control baselines and are
independent of any system impact level.
Program management controls should specifically address the unique properties and
requirements of OT, the relationship to non-OT systems, and the relationship to other programs
concerned with the operational characteristics of OT (e.g., safety, efficiency, reliability,
resilience). To achieve this, the security program should utilize interdisciplinary teams that can
help reconcile and balance conflicting equities, objectives, and responsibilities, such as
capability, adaptability, resilience, safety, security, usability, and efficiency.

compensating controls, depending on the system being scanned. For example, vulnerability
examination may be performed using passive monitoring and manual visual inspection to
maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets. That inventory can be cross-referenced against a list
of known vulnerabilities (e.g., CISA advisories, NIST NVD). Production may need to be taken
offline before active scans can be conducted. Scans are scheduled to occur during planned OT
outages whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on adjacent non-OT
networks, extra care is taken to ensure that they do not mistakenly scan the OT network.
Automated network scanning is not applicable to non-routable communications, such as serial
networks. Compensating controls include providing a replicated or simulated system for
conducting scans or host-based vulnerability applications.
Control Enhancement: (2) (5) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: Examples of discoverable information in OT could
include information about key personnel or technical information related to systems and
configurations. Locations that may need to be monitored or scanned include technical forums,
blogs, and vendor or contractor websites.
Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: For federal organizations, CISA Binding Operational
Directive 20-01 requires individual federal civilian executive branch agencies to develop and
publish a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) for their internet-accessible systems and services
and maintain processes to support their VDP. A VDP may be implemented at the organization
level rather than for each individual system. Federal and non-federal organizations could achieve
this control by creating and monitoring an email address published on a public-facing website for
contacting the organization regarding disclosures.

OT Discussion: Organizations engage with OT suppliers to raise awareness of cybersecurity
needs. The SCADA/Control Systems Procurement Project provides example cybersecurity
procurement language for OT.
Control Enhancements: (1) (2) (9) OT Discussion: When acquiring OT products, consideration
for security requirements may not have been incorporated into the design. Procurement may need
to consider alternative products or complementary hardware or plan for compensating controls.
Control Enhancement: (10) OT Discussion: The use of approved PIV products is only required
for organizations that follow OMB Memorandum M-19-17 (e.g., federal agencies and
contractors). Example compensating controls include employing external products on the FIPS
201-approved products list for PIV capabilities in conjunction with OT products.
Control Enhancement: (5) (12) No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding SA-4 (12) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Organizationally sensitive
or proprietary OT data is often provided to contractors for project development or support, so
data ownership should be defined prior to exchanging data with a vendor or integrator. The
potential sharing of data with other parties and the potential deletion of the data after project
completion should be determined. OT systems that are operated by contractors on behalf of the
organization may be subject to the same requirements (e.g., legal, regulatory, etc.) for data
ownership and retention.

to mitigate against known threats and vulnerabilities to unsupported system components.

F.7.17.        SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION – SC
Tailoring Considerations for the System and Communications Protection Family
The use of cryptography is determined after careful consideration of the security needs and the
potential ramifications on system performance. For example, the organization considers whether
latency induced from the use of cryptography would adversely impact the operational
performance of the OT. While the legacy devices commonly found within OT often lack direct
support for cryptographic functions, compensating controls (e.g., encapsulations) may be used to
meet the intent of the control.

OT Discussion: Some OT equipment may be more susceptible to DoS attacks due to the time
criticality of some OT applications. Risk-based analysis informs the prioritization of DoS
protection and the establishment of policy and procedure.

Control Enhancement: (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (21) No OT discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (18) OT Discussion: The organization selects an appropriate failure mode
(e.g., permit or block all communications).
Control Enhancement: (28) OT Discussion: Organizations consider the need for a direct
connection to a public network for each OT system, including potential benefits, additional threat
vectors, and potential adverse impacts that are specifically relevant to the type of public access
that connection introduces.
Control Enhancement: (29) OT Discussion: Subnets can be used to isolate low-risk functions
from higher-risk ones and control from safety. Subnets should be considered along with other
boundary protection technologies.

Rationale for adding SC-7 (18) to MOD baseline: The ability to choose the failure mode for the
physical part of the OT differentiates the OT from other IT systems. This choice may be a
significant influence in mitigating the impact of a failure.
Rationale for adding SC-7 (28) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Access to OT should be
restricted to the individuals required for operation. A connection made from the OT directly to a
public network has limited applicability in OT environments but significant potential risk.
Rationale for adding SC-7 (29) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: In OT environments,
subnets and zoning are common practices for isolating functions.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: When transmitting across untrusted network
segments, the organization explores all possible cryptographic integrity mechanisms (e.g., digital
signature, hash function) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Example
compensating controls include physical protections, such as a secure conduit (e.g., point-to-point
link) between two system components.

OT Discussion: The organization selects an appropriate failure state. Preserving OT state
information includes consistency among OT state variables and the physical state that the OT
represents (e.g., whether valves are open or closed, communication permitted or blocked,
continue operations).
Rationale for adding SC-24 to MOD baseline: As part of the architecture and design of the OT,
the organization selects an appropriate failure state in accordance with the function performed by
the OT and the operational environment. The ability to choose the failure mode for the physical
part of OT differentiates OT systems from other IT systems. This choice may be a significant
influence in mitigating the impact of a failure since it may be disruptive to ongoing physical
processes (e.g., valves failing in closed position may adversely affect system cooling).

  SC-45 (1)
               AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE

OT Discussion: Organizations coordinate time synchronization on OT to allow for accurate
troubleshooting and forensics.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Syncing with an authoritative time source may be
selected as a control when data is being correlated across organizational boundaries. OT employ
suitable mechanisms (e.g., GPS, IEEE 1588) for timestamps.
Rationale for adding SC-45 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Organizations may find
relative system time beneficial for many OT systems to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of
essential functions. Time synchronization can also make root cause analysis more efficient by
ensuring that audit logs from different systems are aligned so that organizations have an accurate
view of events across multiple systems when the logs are aggregated.

OT Discussion: Organizations consider which systems require alternate communication paths to
ensure that a loss of communication does not lead to an unacceptable loss of view or control or to
a safety event.
Rationale for adding SC-47 to HIGH baseline: For continuity of operations during an incident,
organizations should consider establishing alternate communications paths for command-and-
control purposes to continue to operate and take appropriate actions for high-impact systems
when the loss of availability or integrity may result in severe or catastrophic adverse impacts,
including impacts to safety and critical service delivery.

 SC-51        Hardware-Based Protection

OT Discussion: Some OT systems support write-protection by implementing physical key
switches or write-protect switches. Organizations define the systems for which write-protection
will be enabled and develop a process for how to take the system out of write-protect mode.

 SI-2 (2)   FLAW REMEDIATION | AUTOMATED FLAW REMEDIATION STATUS                 Select      Select

OT Discussion: Flaw remediation, or patching, is complicated since many OT employ OSs and
other software that are no longer maintained by the vendors. OT operators may also not have the
resources or capability to test patches and are dependent on vendors to validate the operability of
a patch. Sometimes, the organization has no choice but to accept additional risk if no vendor
patch is available, if patching requires additional time to complete validation or testing, or if
deployment requires an unacceptable operations shutdown. In these situations, compensating
controls should be implemented (e.g., limiting the exposure of the vulnerable system, restricting
vulnerable services, implementing virtual patching). Other compensating controls that do not
decrease the residual risk but increase the ability to respond may be desirable (e.g., provide a
timely response in case of an incident, devise a plan to ensure that the OT can identify
exploitation of the flaw). Testing flaw remediation in an OT may exceed the organization’s
available resources.
Control Enhancement: (2) No OT discussion for this control.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding SI-13 control to HIGH baseline: OT are designed and built with certain
boundary conditions, design parameters, and assumptions about their environment and mode of
operation. OT may run much longer than conventional systems, allowing latent flaws that are not
manifest in other environments to become effective. For example, integer overflow might never
occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence of the overflow.
Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in OT can lead to the identification of
emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative
and restorative actions (e.g., restarting the system or application) are prudent but may not be
acceptable in OT for operational reasons.

OT Discussion: The selected failure conditions and corresponding procedures may vary among
baselines. The same failure event may trigger different responses, depending on the impact level.
Mechanical and analog systems can be used to provide mechanisms to ensure fail-safe
procedures. Fail-safe states should incorporate potential impacts to human safety, physical
systems, and the environment. A related controls is CP-6.
Rationale for adding SI-17 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: This control provides a
structure for the organization to identify its policy and procedures for dealing with failures and
other incidents. Creating a written record of the decision process for selecting incidents and
appropriate responses in light of a changing environment of operations is part of risk
management.

received and components produced. Many OT systems use legacy components that cannot meet
modern supply chain expectations. Appropriate compensating controls should be developed to
achieve organizational supply chain expectations for legacy systems.

component. Organizations identify critical OT system components and controls to ensure an
adequate supply in the event of supply chain disruptions.
