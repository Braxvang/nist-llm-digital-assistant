This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283.
NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy
authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance
with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies,
may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each
publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For
planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.

                                                                                             Access restrictions for change represent the enforcement side of SecCM. Configuration change
                                                                                             control is a process for funneling changes for a system through a managed process; however,

                                                                                             outside of the process. Access restrictions are a mechanism to enforce configuration control
                                                                                             processes by controlling who has access to the system and/or its constituent CIs to make changes.
                                                                                             Access restrictions for change may also include controlling access to additional change-related

                                                                                                     i. Determine the possible types of configuration changes that can be made in the system

                                                                                                          to ensure that only authorized individuals are able to make the appropriate changes.

                                                                                                      however, system documentation may still require updating (e.g., the System Security

                                                                                                 v. Test the proposed change for security and functional impacts. Testing confirms the

                                                                                                 vi. Approve the change. This step is usually performed by the CCB. The CCB may require
                                                                                                     the implementation of additional controls if the change is necessary for mission
                                                                                                     accomplishment but has a negative impact on the security of the system and organization.
