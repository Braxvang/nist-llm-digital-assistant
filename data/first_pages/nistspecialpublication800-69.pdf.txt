                                        GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



Executive Summary
In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to home computers, including those
running Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition. These threats are posed by people with many
different motivations, including causing mischief and disruption, committing fraud, and
performing identity theft. The most common threat against Windows XP Home Edition
computers is malware, such as viruses and worms. Users of home computers should ensure that
they are secured properly to provide reasonable protection against threats. Accordingly, this
document provides guidance to people on improving the security of their own home computers
(desktops or laptops) or others’ home computers that run Windows XP Home Edition. The
recommendations draw on a large body of vendor knowledge and government and security
community experience gained over many years of securing personal computers.

Users of Windows XP Home Edition need to be aware of the threats that their computers face
and the security protections available to protect their computers so that they can operate their
computers more securely. Security protections are measures used to thwart threats. Examples of
common security protections are antivirus software, password-protected user accounts, and
automatic software updates and patches. Security protections cannot prevent all attacks, but they
can greatly reduce the opportunities that attackers have to gain access to a computer or to
damage the computer’s software or information. Securing a Windows XP Home Edition
computer effectively and maintaining its security requires a combination of security protections;
if one protection fails or is ineffective against a particular threat, other protections are likely to
prevent the threat from succeeding. Security protections should be updated on a regular basis
because new threats occur on a regular basis.

Implementing the following recommendations should help people to improve the security of
Windows XP Home Edition computers.

Users should eliminate any known weaknesses in their Windows XP Home Edition
computers because attackers will attempt to take advantage of them.

Known weaknesses should be eliminated through a combination of several methods, including
the following:

 Installing Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (SP2) and applying software updates to
   the computer on a regular basis, including Windows XP Home Edition and software
   applications
 Limiting access to the computer through separate password-protected user accounts for each
   person
 Limiting network access by disabling unneeded networking features, limiting the use of
   remote access utilities, and configuring wireless networking securely
 Disabling services that are not needed.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


Users should configure their Windows XP Home Edition computers to use a combination
of software and software features that are designed specifically to stop attacks, particularly
malware.

Every Windows XP Home Edition computer should use antivirus software, antispyware
software, and a personal firewall at all times, and they should be kept up-to-date. Other helpful
software includes spam and Web content filtering and popup blocking. Users can also change
settings on common applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, instant messaging clients,
and office productivity suites to stop some attacks.

Users or administrators of Windows XP Home Edition computers should periodically
perform backups that duplicate data from the computer onto another medium.

Performing regular backups helps to ensure that user data is available after an unfortunate event
such as an attack against the computer, a hardware failure, a natural disaster, or human error.
User data should be backed up periodically, such as weekly or monthly. There are several
options for performing backups on Windows XP Home Edition computers, including utilities
built into Windows XP Home Edition, and third-party utilities and remote backup services.

Users or administrators of Windows XP Home Edition computers that connect to the
Internet should ensure that they are protected properly from Internet-based threats.

The five most important protections that should be used for all Windows XP Home Edition
computers connecting to the Internet are as follows:

 Applying updates to the operating system and major applications (e.g., e-mail clients, Web
   browsers) regularly, preferably through automated means that check for updates frequently
 Using a limited user account for typical daily use of the computer

 Running up-to-date antivirus software and antispyware software that is configured to monitor
   the computer and applications often used to spread malware (e.g., e-mail, Web) and to
   quarantine or delete any identified malware
 Using a personal firewall that is configured to restrict incoming network communications to
   only that which is required
 Performing regular backups so that data can be restored in case an adverse event occurs.

1.      Introduction
1.1     Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in
furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though
attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2     Purpose and Scope

This document seeks to provide advice primarily to experienced Windows XP administrators on
securing Windows XP Home Edition computers for home users, such as telecommuting Federal
civilian agency employees, from common threats such as malware, and keeping the computers
secure. This document gives general guidance on workstation security as well as Windows XP
Home Edition-specific guidance. Although some of the guidance presented in this document
may be applicable to multiple versions of Windows XP, the guidance is specifically intended for
Windows XP Home Edition computers running Service Pack 2. 1

This document is published by NIST as recommended guidance for Federal agencies, in support
of the NIST Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products. 2 Agencies can take
advantage of the contents of this publication in different ways. For example, they could make
telecommuting employees aware of its existence so that the employees can use it to secure the
home computers from which they telecommute. Another example is reusing portions of it in
training and awareness activities for telecommuting employees. The document may also be used
by private sector organizations or individuals in securing personal computers.
1
      Portions of the guidance in this document might be applicable to other versions of Windows XP, but the
      guidance has not been tested on any versions of Windows XP other than Windows XP Home Edition. Also,
      because some versions of Windows XP offer functionality that Windows XP Home Edition does not, the
      guidance presented in this document would be incomplete for other Windows XP versions.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


NIST recommends that organizations wanting to use Windows XP for organization-issued
telecommuting computers should deploy Windows XP Professional instead of Windows XP
Home Edition. Unlike Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional can be centrally
managed and integrated with Microsoft Active Directory architectures, and it also provides
additional security controls that can be enabled to enforce organizational policies, such as
password, audit, patch management, and encryption policies. 3 However, NIST recognizes that
there are many personal home computers running operating systems such as Windows XP Home
Edition that are used by telecommuters to interact with organizations’ information systems. This
publication has been produced to help these telecommuters ensure that their personally owned
Windows XP Home Edition computers are secure.

Windows XP Home Edition computers may need to protect the confidentiality or integrity of
Federal information in storage (e.g., file encryption) or in transit (e.g., virtual private networks
[VPN], secure access to Web pages). Such computers must use Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) approved cryptographic algorithms specified in FIPS or in NIST
Recommendations and contained in validated cryptographic modules. The Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP) at NIST coordinates FIPS testing. 4

1.3     Audience

This document has been created for IT professionals (particularly Windows XP system
administrators and information security personnel) who may need to help secure others’
Windows XP Home Edition computers within home offices. Portions of the document are
intended for Windows XP Home Edition users; these portions assume that readers have
experience as Windows XP users, but not as administrators of Windows XP Home Edition
computers.

1.4     Document Structure

1.5     Quick Start

This document is intended to be used by readers with various levels of Windows XP Home
Edition experience and security knowledge, who are faced with different situations in securing
computers. For example, one reader might be securing a brand-new computer, while another
reader wants to secure a computer that has been in daily use for years. Not all sections of this
guide will apply to every situation. The items below provide general recommendations as to
which sections of the guide should be read, based on the reader’s experience and goals. Readers
who are unsure about the relevance or appropriateness of a particular section should read its
introduction and summary to determine if the section is applicable to their situation.

Users should back up all data and verify the validity of the backups before implementing
any of the recommendations or suggestions in the guide. Readers with little or no Windows
XP Home Edition experience should seek assistance in applying the recommendations to
their computers. Although the recommendations presented in this guide have been tested
thoroughly, every computer’s existing configuration and environment is unique, so

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


changing settings could have unforeseen consequences, including loss of data and loss of
Windows or application functionality.
Sections 2 and 3 talk in detail about Windows XP Home Edition security concepts and
capabilities; this is background information for other sections that provide step-by-step directions
for securing computers, and also serves as general reference material. Readers who want to have
a better understanding of security should read Sections 2 and 3 first. Readers who just want to
secure computers without necessarily understanding the significance of each action should skip
Sections 2 and 3.

Readers should carefully read and follow the step-by-step security directions listed for the
appropriate goal from the following list: 5

 Build or Rebuild a Windows XP Home Edition Computer. This is for readers that want

2.      The Need to Secure Windows XP Home Edition Computers
In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to home computers. These threats are
posed by people with many different motivations, including causing mischief and disruption,
committing fraud, and performing identity theft. Users of home computers can increase their
security to provide better protection against these threats. The goal of this guide is to provide
guidance to users on how to improve the security of their home computers (desktops or laptops)
that run Windows XP Home Edition. This guide draws on a large body of vendor knowledge
and government and security community experience gained over many years of securing
computers.

      Because of differences in the security features available on various Windows versions,
      the guidance in this document is only applicable to Windows XP Home Edition systems.
      It should not be applied to any other versions of Windows XP, including Windows XP
      Professional, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and Windows XP Media Center Edition, or
      to any versions of Windows other than XP. Portions of the guidance in this document
      might be applicable to other versions of Windows XP, but the guidance has not been
      tested on any versions of Windows XP other than Windows XP Home Edition. Also,
      because some versions of Windows XP offer functionality that Windows XP Home Edition
      does not, the guidance presented in this document would be incomplete for other
      Windows XP versions.

This section of the guide explains the need to secure home computers running Windows XP
Home Edition. It describes common threats against Windows XP Home Edition computers that
are likely to affect or attempt to affect users. This section also discusses the roles that Windows
XP Home Edition computers can play, such as personal use and business use, and introduces the
idea of threat environments, such as a home environment, office environment, or wireless
network hotspot. This section then introduces the concept of security protections, which are
ways of counteracting threats within a particular environment.

2.1     The Roles of Computers

Every computer has at least one role, such as the following:

 Personal Use. The computer is used to browse the Web, check e-mail, use instant messaging
      and peer-to-peer file sharing services, play network games, play audio and video content, and
      perform other personal tasks. Although the information on the computer is primarily
      personal, it may also include sensitive information such as financial data from balancing
      bank accounts, paying bills and making purchases online, doing online banking, and using
      tax preparation software.
 Business Use. The computer is used by a telecommuter to connect back to the employer’s
      network and computers. The information processed by the computer is primarily corporate
      data.




                                                 2-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Home Network Use. The computer provides services to other computers on a home
      network. For example, the computer may be used as a file and print server, a multimedia
      server (e.g., music jukebox), or a gateway for sharing an Internet connection. The
      information processed by the computer varies based on the roles of the other computers on
      the home network.
Many computers have more than one role, and might even have multiple roles simultaneously.
For example, a computer could be used to check personal e-mail while it is also connected to an
employer’s network. Thinking about roles is important because a computer that performs more
important functions or contains more important data than another computer might need stronger
protection from threats.

2.2     Common Threats

The most common threat against Windows XP Home Edition computers is malware. 6 Malware,
also known as malicious code, refers to a computer program that is covertly placed onto a
computer with the intent to compromise the privacy, accuracy, or reliability of the computer’s
data, applications, or operating system. Common types of malware threats include the following:

 Viruses, which are designed to self-replicate—make copies of themselves—and distribute
      the copies to other files, programs, or computers
 Worms, which are self-replicating programs that are completely self-contained and self-
      propagating
 Malicious mobile code, which is malicious software that is transmitted from a remote
      system to be executed on a local system, typically without the user’s explicit instruction
 Trojan horses, which are non-replicating programs that appear to be benign but actually
      have hidden malicious purposes
 Rootkits, which are collections of files that are installed onto computers to alter their
      functionality in a malicious and stealthy way, including installing and hiding other types of
      malware.
Malware threats can infect computers through many means, including e-mail, Web sites, file
downloads and file sharing, and instant messaging. Malware can disrupt a computer in many
ways, such as the following examples:

 Destroying data, such as e-mails or word processing documents

 Causing computers to crash or reboot repeatedly

 Using a computer’s resources, such as disk space, processing power, and network bandwidth

 Exposing personal data to others, such as e-mailing personal documents to others and
      collecting financial information viewed in a Web browser

6
      For more information on malware, see NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident
      Prevention and Handling, which is available for download at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.


                                                         2-2
                                             GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Attacking other computers, such as sending out many e-mails to infect other computers or
    performing a denial of service attack against a commercial Web site.

    One form of malware is known as a zombie or a bot. A bot is a program installed onto a
    computer that causes it to attack other computers, typically without the knowledge of the
    computers’ users. Through the use of automated tools, attackers can coordinate the
    actions of thousands of bots at once (known as a botnet) to launch massive attacks
    against Web sites and other computers.

Spyware—malware specifically intended to violate a user’s privacy—has become a major
concern. 7 Although privacy-violating malware has been in use for many years, it became much
more widespread in 2003 and 2004, with spyware invading many computers. Spyware can
monitor a person’s Web browser use and report personal behavior and related information to
others, such as marketing firms. Some forms of spyware are specifically designed to assist in
conducting financial fraud, such as collecting credit card numbers and bank account numbers.
Spyware can also cause the same disruptions to computers as standard malware, such as crashes
and data destruction.

In addition to malware and spyware, other common threats against Windows XP Home Edition
computers include the following:

 Phishing. Phishing attacks involve the use of fraudulent e-mails and Web sites that look
    very similar to the legitimate sources, with the intent of committing financial fraud. These
    attacks trick users into revealing important information, such as bank account numbers, credit
    card numbers, PIN numbers, and financial Web site usernames and passwords. An example
    of a phishing attack is a spam message that appears to come from a bank—it uses the bank’s
    name, logo, slogans, and other information and graphics to attempt to look legitimate. The
    message asks the user to update her personal information by clicking on a URL. This URL
    actually directs the user to a phony Web site that looks like the bank’s real Web site. 8
    Thinking that the Web site is legitimate, the user types in her username and password, then
    her bank account number; the Web site gives this information to the attacker. 9
 Scanning Tools. Attackers use a variety of automated tools that send a series of messages to
    other computers to try to learn more about them. These tools, known as scanners, can check
    hundreds or thousands of computers an hour to identify good targets for future attacks. A

7
    Examples of spyware include keystroke loggers (also known as keyloggers), which monitor and record
    keyboard usage (e.g., usernames and passwords; financial information such as credit card numbers, social
    security numbers, and personal identification numbers [PIN]), and tracking cookies, which are small data files
    that hold information about the use of Web sites and are misused to track a user’s Web browsing activities for
    questionable reasons without the user’s knowledge or consent.
8
    A term often used in conjunction with phishing is pharming. Although both involve the use of deceit to gain
    access to personal information, they are performed differently. In pharming, an attacker actually takes control
    of a URL, such as the address of a Web site. Users enter the correct Web site URL into their Web browsers but
    are taken to a phony Web site run by the attacker. Users then enter passwords, PIN numbers, and other
    sensitive information, which the attacker collects.
9
    Should a user accidentally reveal sensitive information to an unknown Web site, the user should immediately
    contact the organization associated with the sensitive information (in this example, the bank) to prevent
    malicious parties from misusing the information to commit fraud.


                                                       2-3
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      computer connected directly to the Internet is scanned constantly; if the computer is not
      protected, attackers could gain information from the scans that would help them in planning
      attacks against the computer.
 Attack Tools. Many attackers use automated tools that send various types of attacks to other
      computers. Attack tools are sometimes used in conjunction with scanning tools; an attacker
      first scans computers to find ones that are good targets, then launches attacks against those
      targets. Because many attack tools are fully automated and run for extended periods,
      computers connected directly to the Internet need protection against these attacks at all times.

2.3     Security Protections

Security protections, also known as security controls, are measures against threats that are
intended to compensate for the computer’s security weaknesses, also known as vulnerabilities.
Threats attempt to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities can be
eliminated through security protections, such as a feature in an application that automatically
downloads and installs new versions of the application that have corrected previous errors. For
vulnerabilities that cannot be eliminated, security protections can prevent attacks from taking
advantage of them, such as antivirus software stopping an infected email from being opened by a
user. No matter how many security protections are used, it is simply not possible to provide
100% protection against attacks because of the complexity of computing. A more realistic goal
is to use security protections to give attackers as few opportunities as feasible to gain access to a
computer or to damage the computer’s software or information.

Security protections can be grouped into the following three categories:

 Technical. A technical protection is a way of configuring a computer to restrict the actions
      that can be performed within the computer and to monitor the actions that are performed. A
      commonly used technical protection is a username and password, which limit access to a
      computer, service, or other resource.
 Operational. An operational protection is one that involves the actions performed by the
      computer’s users. For example, antivirus software checks a user’s files, e-mails, and Web
      browsing for malware and quarantines or deletes any malware to prevent it from infecting the
      computer and causing damage. Other examples of operational protections are making
      backup copies of users’ files, keeping a computer and its media (e.g., CDs) in a locked room,
      and learning how to use a computer securely (e.g., how to handle e-mail so as to avoid
      infecting a computer with malware).
 Management. A management protection involves oversight of the security of computers.
      Most types of management protections are focused on computers within an organization, but
      a few apply to individual computers, such as performing periodic reviews of their security
      and identifying vulnerabilities.
Securing a computer effectively usually requires a combination of security protections from all
of these categories. If one protection fails or is ineffective against a particular threat, other
protections are likely to prevent the threat from succeeding. Relying on only a few protections
can lead to serious security breaches. For example, a lack of physical security protections could

                                      GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


make it easy for a computer to be stolen. Omitting training and awareness protections is unwise
because users that are not aware of good security practices could inadvertently circumvent other
protections. Users also need to be aware of the threats that their computers face and the
capabilities of the security protections on their computers so that they can operate their
computers more securely. Some operational protections such as antivirus software are always
needed because they can recognize and respond to known and predictable threats within the
computer automatically. Unfortunately, although many protections are very beneficial, they also
make computers less convenient and more difficult to use. For example, passwords provide
protection, but they can also be hard to remember.

Because most management protections are not applicable to individual Windows XP Home
Edition computers used at individuals’ homes, the focus of this guide is technical and operational
protections. This guide also provides limited information on the relevant management
protections, primarily performing periodic vulnerability assessments. Operational protections for
physical security are not addressed in this guide; however, users should be aware of the physical
risks against their computers and ensure that their computers are adequately protected. Examples
of physical risks are theft, power disruptions, and water.

2.4   Threat Environments

Every computer resides in an environment that exposes it to certain types of threats. For
example, a desktop computer connected directly to the Internet from a house, and a desktop
computer on a large organization’s internal network, are likely to be exposed to different types
and quantities of threats. The large organization probably uses additional security protections
not present in the home computing environment; these protections block many threats from ever
reaching the organization’s desktop computer. In a home environment, it is not feasible from a
cost perspective to have the same level of security protections. Also, most of the security
protections used by a large organization require extensive technical expertise to configure and
manage them effectively.

This guide assumes that the Windows XP Home Edition computers being secured are in home
environments, and that they are either connected directly to the Internet or are part of a small
office/home office (SOHO) network that is connected to the Internet. The recommendations
presented in this guide focus on typical threats found in home environments. Many Windows
XP Home Edition computers (particularly laptops) are also used in mobile environments such as
a coffee shop wireless network hotspot, a university network, or a hotel wireless network.
Computers that are used in multiple environments are typically exposed to a wider variety of
threats than computers used in a single environment, and are more likely to spread malware from
one environment to another (e.g., from a store’s wireless hotspot to a home network). Also,
mobile computers are more likely to be lost or stolen, which could lead to the disclosure of
sensitive information on the computer. Accordingly, this guide presents additional
recommendations for securing mobile computers.

2.5   Summary

In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to home computers. The motivations
for these threats include causing disruption, committing fraud, and performing identity theft.
Users need to secure their home computers to provide better protection against these threats,
especially the most common one, malware. Security protections are measures used to thwart
threats. Security protections cannot prevent all attacks, but they can greatly reduce the
opportunities that attackers have to breach a computer’s security. Securing a computer
effectively requires a combination of security protections; if one protection fails or is ineffective
against a particular threat, other protections are likely to prevent the threat from succeeding.
Users also need to be aware of the threats that their computers face and the capabilities of the
security protections on their computers so that they can operate their computers more securely.

3.    Overview of Security Protections
As described in Section 2, security protections are measures that thwart threats. This section
provides an overview of the types of security protections that are most important for securing
Windows XP Home Edition computers. For each control type, the section provides a brief
description of the protection, explains what types of threats it protects against, discusses its
relative strengths and weaknesses, and recommends how it should be used. People should strive
to secure their computers to a reasonable degree using a combination of technical and operational
protections, such as antivirus software, Windows XP Home Edition configuration settings, and
user education and security awareness activities. Because new vulnerabilities in Windows XP
Home Edition and applications are discovered on an ongoing basis, it is important that many
protections are not only used, but also updated on a regular basis.

3.1   Reducing Weaknesses

One of the most important parts of securing a Windows XP Home Edition computer is
eliminating known weaknesses, because attackers will attempt to take advantage of them. This
section makes recommendations for eliminating weaknesses using five types of techniques:
updating software, restricting access to user accounts and sessions, limiting network access to the
computer, protecting files and folders from unauthorized access, and disabling unneeded
services.

3.1.1 Software Updates

As described in Section 2, many threats take advantage of vulnerabilities in operating systems
such as Windows XP Home Edition and applications such as e-mail clients and Web browsers.
Microsoft and other software vendors release updates for their software to eliminate
vulnerabilities. Accordingly, users should ensure that software updates are applied to their
Windows XP Home Edition computers on a regular basis. Windows XP Home Edition and most
popular applications provide built-in mechanisms to update themselves automatically. This
section describes these update features. Section 5.2 provides detailed directions on
implementing the recommendations presented in this section.

3.1.1.1 Keep Microsoft Software Updated

Microsoft releases updated code for Windows XP Home Edition-related security issues through
three mechanisms. A hotfix takes care of a specific problem. A security rollup is a collection of
hotfixes. A service pack (SP) is a major upgrade to the operating system that resolves dozens of
functional and security problems and often introduces new features or makes significant
configuration changes to computers. Microsoft provides two ways of distributing hotfixes,
security rollups, and service packs to individual computers: Automatic Updates and Microsoft




                                                3-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


Update (formerly known as Windows Update). 10 Microsoft also makes service packs for
Windows XP Home Edition available on CD. 11

Automatic Updates is a built-in feature of Windows XP Home Edition. To function properly, it
must be enabled from an administrative account. Once enabled, it can be run from any user
account. It automatically checks the Microsoft update servers for Windows XP Home Edition
and Microsoft application updates. Automatic Updates has a prioritization feature that ensures
the most critical updates are installed before less important updates. As shown in Figure 3-1,
Automatic Updates provides four configuration options to users.

     Microsoft offers a free CD with Windows XP SP2; more information is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/sp2/cdorder/en_us/default.mspx. Microsoft also
     offers a network installation package that can be used to distribute large service packs to multiple Windows XP
     computers on a single network. The package for Windows XP SP2 is available for download at
     http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=049c9dbe-3b8e-4f30-8245-

Generally, it is best to configure the computer to download and install updates automatically,
unless bandwidth usage is a concern. Downloading updates could adversely affect the
functionality of a computer that is connected to the Internet on a slow link. In this case, it would
be preferable for Automatic Updates to be configured to notify the computer’s administrator that
new patches are available. The administrator should then make arrangements to download and
install the patches at the next possible time when the computer is not needed for other
functionality.

Windows XP Home Edition also offers an Install updates and shutdown option as part of its
Shut Down dialog box. Administrators can configure their computers to download updates
automatically; when they shut down a computer, the option will appear and allow administrators
to launch the update installation process.

Administrators can also manually update their computers by visiting the Microsoft Update Web
site. 12 The site will first validate that the Windows XP Home Edition software installed on the
computer is authentic and properly licensed. Next, it will check the computer to determine what
security and functionality updates are available and produce a list of updates. The administrator
can then select which updates should be installed at this time, and tell Microsoft Update to
perform the installations. In addition to retrieving Windows XP Home Edition updates,
Microsoft Update can also get security updates for other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft
Office, and non-security updates for Microsoft software and for hardware. Administrators
should run Microsoft Update when updating a new installation of Windows XP Home Edition,
and should also run it periodically throughout the life of the system to acquire non-security
updates, such as new hardware drivers. Even though these updates are not specifically intended
to improve security, some might have security implications, such as adding new, stronger
security features.

Table 3-1 compares the update methods described in this section, indicating under what
circumstances each method might be appropriate.

     The Microsoft Update Web site is located at http://update.microsoft.com/. The site may only be used with the
     Internet Explorer Web browser. Windows XP Home Edition computers that are not fully updated may display
     the Windows Update Web site instead of the Microsoft Update Web site.

3.1.1.2 Keep Other Software Updated

In addition to keeping Microsoft software updated, it is important to keep other software
applications on Windows XP Home Edition computers updated as well. For example,
vulnerabilities are discovered in e-mail clients and Web browsers periodically; attackers can take
advantage of these problems to infect computers with malware or perform other malicious acts.
Also, security software such as antivirus and antispyware software needs to be kept up-to-date so
that it can detect and stop the latest security threats. Administrators should check each third-
party application on the computer to determine how it can be updated, then ensure that it is
updated regularly. Updates are usually available through at least one of the following methods.

 Automatic Update Feature. Many software programs have a feature similar to Microsoft’s
    Automatic Updates that automatically checks for, downloads, and installs updates from the
    software vendor. Administrators may need to enable this feature and set a frequency for
    update checks, such as daily or weekly.


                                                     3-4
                                            GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Manual Update Feature. Many software programs allow administrators to manually launch
     an update feature which checks for, downloads, and installs updates from the software
     vendor. Manual updates should be performed at least monthly, preferably weekly.
 Separate Update Acquisition. Some software programs do not have a built-in feature for
     acquiring updates. Administrators may need to visit the software vendor’s Web site, find the
     appropriate Web page (usually the support, download, or security page), download the
     update, and then run it to install it onto the computer. In some cases, rather than applying an
     update to the application, administrators need to download and install a new version of the
     whole application instead.
Some applications offer updates at no charge, while others require an annual fee or other
payment to receive updates (e.g., new antivirus software signatures). Most software vendors that
charge a fee allow users to pay it through their Web site and receive updates within minutes of
making the payment.

3.1.2 User Accounts and Sessions

Windows XP Home Edition computers can be configured to limit access through user accounts
and passwords. This section describes ways in which users can take advantage of these
configuration options to prevent unauthorized local and network access to the computer and its
applications and data. Specific directions on implementing the recommendations described in
this section are provided in Section 5.4.1.
3.1.2.1 Use Separate Accounts for Each Person

A Windows XP Home Edition computer can be run with a single user account that multiple
people use, or with separate user accounts for each person. From a security standpoint, it is
strongly recommended that each person has a separate account. 13 On Windows XP Home
Edition computers, the capability to have multiple user accounts is known as Personalized Login.
Having an individual user account for each person allows personal data (e.g., each account has
its own My Documents folder) and settings (e.g., Internet Explorer bookmarks and security
settings) to be kept private from other users. 14 Also, should malware infect a computer, it might
only be able to affect the files and settings of the current user, not other users, depending on what
rights the current user has (as described in Section 3.1.2.4).

Windows XP Home Edition offers another feature closely related to Personalized Login called
Fast User Switching (FUS). 15 It allows two or more users to be logged into the same Windows

13
     Microsoft has an overview of Windows XP Home Edition computer sharing features at
     http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/evaluation/features/sharing.mspx. Additional information on user
     account security is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ua_c_account_types.mspx.
14
     Personal data is only kept private if the user account is protected with a password and the Windows XP Home
     Edition computer is using the NTFS filesystem
     (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/evaluate/xpsec.mspx).
15
     Additional information on FUS is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fast_user_switching.mspx
     and from Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 279765 (http://support.microsoft.com/?id=279765) and 294739
     (http://support.microsoft.com/?id=294739).


                                                      3-5
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


XP Home Edition computer simultaneously, but only a single user session is active at any given
time. The use of Fast User Switching is recommended on a computer where a user may need
brief access to a computer that someone else is using, because it preserves security and privacy
for both users. The person currently using the computer cannot gain access to the other user’s
session, assuming that each user account is protected with a password.

3.1.2.2 Protect Each Account with a Password

Whether a Windows XP Home Edition computer has a single shared account or multiple
accounts, each account usually should have a password. 16 Without a password, unauthorized
people could use the computer—not only people with physical access to the computer, but also
possibly remote attackers contacting the computer through the Internet if the computer is not
protected through a personal firewall and other technical controls. Windows XP Home Edition
does not have any requirements for the quality of passwords, such as minimum password length,
so users are responsible for understanding the desirable characteristics of passwords and
selecting sufficiently strong passwords. Recommended practices include the following: 17

 Changing Passwords Regularly. This is necessary because if a password is unknowingly
     revealed to an unauthorized person or uncovered by malware or other automated attacks, the
     password could be used without authorization for a long time. Users should change their
     passwords at least once every three months.
 Selecting a Sufficiently Long Password. Longer passwords are more difficult to guess than
     shorter passwords. The downside is that longer passwords are often more difficult for users
     to remember. Users should select passwords that are at least eight characters long. 18 Users
     should also consider using passphrases, which are long passwords usually composed of
     multiple words. Passphrases may be easier to remember than conventional passwords.
 Creating a Complex Password. This refers to the variety of characters within the password.
     For example, a password made of all lower case letters is a relatively simple password, while
     a password made of upper and lower case letters, digits, and symbols such as punctuation
     marks is a relatively complex password. The more complex the password is, the more
     difficult it will generally be for others to guess. Users should select passwords that contain
     digits and/or symbols in addition to letters.
 Not Reusing Passwords. Old passwords may have been compromised, or an attacker may
     have taken a long time to crack encrypted passwords. Reusing an old password could
     inadvertently give attackers access to the computer. Users should not reuse old passwords,
     nor should they create new passwords that are very similar to old passwords. For example, if
     the old password was “dahlia*1”, the new password should not be “dahlia*2”.


16
     If the computer has a single user, is located in a physically secure area, and is protected from unauthorized
     network access by sufficient technical controls (e.g., personal firewall), then it might be acceptable not to have a
     password.
17
     Microsoft provides guidance on passwords for small business users in the Security Guide for Small Business,
     which is available for download at http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/support/security-toolkit-pdf.mspx.
18
     The Microsoft Security Guide for Small Business recommends a minimum password length of eight characters.
     The maximum password length in Windows XP Home Edition is 128 characters.


                                                          3-6
                                             GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Not Using Password Hints. Password hints can be very helpful to people in guessing
     others’ passwords and using them to gain unauthorized access to a computer. Users should
     not use password hints unless their computers do not need protection from people with
     physical access to them.
 Not Using Passwords for Other Accounts. Users should not use the same password for
     multiple accounts, such as professional and personal e-mail accounts, instant messaging
     accounts, and e-commerce Web site accounts. If the password used for Windows XP Home
     Edition access is also used for other user accounts and an attacker learned one of the
     passwords, the attacker could then access the other accounts.
3.1.2.3 Disable Unneeded Default User Accounts

Default user accounts are often used in attacks against various types of computers, including
Windows XP Home Edition. By disabling certain default Windows XP Home Edition user
accounts, it will be more difficult for attackers to gain access to a computer; however, disabling
some accounts can impair the functionality of the computer. The default user accounts are as
follows: 19

 Administrator. Attackers often attempt to use the default Administrator account on various
     operating systems. Windows XP Home Edition does have an account named Administrator,
     but it is only available for use when the computer is booted into Safe Mode. Since the
     account is inaccessible under normal circumstances and is needed for Safe Mode to work
     properly, the original Administrator account should not be disabled, and it should have a
     password set to prevent unauthorized access.20 Windows XP Home Edition requires a
     separate administrative account to be created during the Windows XP Home Edition
     installation process. This account or other additional administrative accounts should be used
     instead of the original Administrator account when performing computer administration.
 Guest. In earlier versions of Windows, the Guest account was a common means by which to
     gain remote access to a computer through a network and launch additional attacks against the
     computer. In Windows XP Home Edition, the Guest account has strictly limited privileges.
     By default, it is disabled. When enabled, it can only access resources that have been
     specifically designated for remote sharing, such as folders and printers. If a computer does
     not share any of its resources, the Guest account is effectively made useless.
 HelpAssistant. This account is used only for Remote Assistance sessions, which are
     described in Section 3.1.3.2. The HelpAssistant account should be disabled unless the
     Remote Assistance feature is needed. By default, this account should already be disabled. 21



19
     The HelpAssistant and Support_388945a0 accounts are not visible from the User Accounts portion of the
     Control Panel. However, the accounts can be viewed and disabled from the Command Prompt.
20
     To ensure that the Administrator account can be accessed when needed, there should either be a current
     password reset disk for the Administrator account at all times, or the Administrator account’s password should
     be written down and stored in a physically secure location. The password reset disk can be used for the
     Administrator account in Safe Mode.
21
     This account is disabled by default only on Windows XP Home Edition computers running Service Pack 2. For
     earlier versions of Windows XP Home Edition, this account is enabled by default.


                                                        3-7
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Support_388945a0. This account is intended to assist in providing technical support within
     an enterprise environment. Therefore, it should be disabled for computers used in home and
     mobile environments. By default, this account should already be disabled. Computer
     vendors may install their own remote technical support accounts as part of their Windows XP
     Home Edition installations. Such accounts should also be disabled if possible.
3.1.2.4 Use a Limited User Account for Daily Tasks

User accounts on Windows XP Home Edition computers can have full privileges or limited
privileges. An account with full privileges, also known as an administrative account, is intended
to be used only when performing computer management tasks, such as installing updates and
application software, managing user accounts, and modifying Windows XP Home Edition and
application settings. If a computer is attacked while an administrative account is in use, the
attack will be able to do more damage to the computer. Therefore, user accounts should be set
up to have limited privileges; such accounts are known as daily use or limited user accounts
(LUA). 22 Users should not use administrative accounts for general tasks such as reading e-mail
and surfing the Web because such tasks are common ways of infecting computers with malware.
Malware is likely to do more damage to a computer if accessed using an administrative account
than a limited user account.

The primary disadvantages of having separate administrative and limited user accounts are that
limited users might not be able to run some applications, such as games and other applications
designed for older operating systems, or to install applications, Windows XP Home Edition
updates, and application updates. This could cause a significant delay in downloading and
installing updates, as well as making other certain tasks less convenient for users. To help work
around this problem, Windows XP Home Edition includes a Run As feature, which allows a
person logged in as a limited user to perform individual administrative tasks. For example, by
right-clicking on an Internet Explorer icon, a limited user can select the Run As option, which
causes Internet Explorer to be run with administrative privileges after the limited user has
provided a valid administrative username and password. The Fast User Switching feature
provides another way to use a separate administrative account to perform a single task while still
logged in to a computer with a limited user account.

3.1.2.5 Protect User Sessions from Unauthorized Physical Access

In addition to the limitations on user accounts already described in this section, it is also
important in some environments to provide protection against unauthorized physical access to
Windows XP Home Edition computers. For example, if a computer is sitting unattended in an
area that other people can access, someone could walk up to the computer and masquerade as the
user, such as sending e-mail from the user’s account, accessing the user’s work, making
purchases from Web sites, or accessing sensitive financial information stored on the computer.
To prevent such events, a user can lock the current session by holding down the Windows logo
key on the keyboard and then pressing the L key, or by pressing the Ctrl + Alt + Del keys
simultaneously and then selecting Lock Computer. This essentially works the same way as Fast
User Switching; the user needs to enter the account’s password to regain access to the session.
22

3.1.2.6 Protect Passwords

Another important task is to create a password reset disk, which can be used to regain access to
the computer if a password is forgotten. 23 Without a password reset disk, a forgotten
administrative password could necessitate reinstalling Windows XP Home Edition and all
applications, as well as losing all data stored on the computer. Therefore, the administrator of a
Windows XP Home Edition computer should create a password reset disk and update the disk
each time the administrative password is changed. The administrator should also ensure that the
password reset disk is stored in a physically secure location. Users can also create password
reset disks for their individual accounts if desired; these should also be stored securely.

Although Windows XP Home Edition offers built-in capabilities to create a password reset disk,
this feature requires the presence of a floppy disk drive and cannot be used on computers without
such a drive. 24 If a password reset disk cannot be created, it is strongly recommended to write
down the administrative password and store it in a physically secure location in case the
password is forgotten. Users can also write down their own passwords and store them securely
as well if desired.

3.1.3 Networking

A Windows XP Home Edition computer can be configured to limit network access; this can
reduce the number of ways in which attackers can try to gain access to the computer. This
section makes recommendations for configuring networking features to provide increased
protection for the computer. Section 5.4.2 provides detailed directions for implementing the
recommendations.

3.1.3.1 Disable Unneeded Networking Features

By default, Windows XP Home Edition includes several networking features that can provide
communications and data sharing between computers. Most computers do not need to use all of
these features. Because many attacks are network-based, Windows XP Home Edition computers
should only use the necessary networking features, which should reduce the likelihood that the
computer will be compromised or misused. On Windows XP Home Edition computers, the
networking features that are the most likely candidates for being disabled are as follows:

 The Quality of Service (QoS) Packet Scheduler, which is designed to prioritize network
     traffic by application over slow network connections. For example, it could give e-mail
     communications priority over Web surfing. Unfortunately, most applications cannot use the
     QoS feature, so the QoS Packet Scheduler is beneficial in very few home user situations.
 The File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks service, which allows other
     computers to connect to the local computer’s file and printer shares. This service should only
     be enabled on the computer if the computer shares files or printers with other computers, or if

23
     More information on password reset disks is available from Microsoft Knowledge Base (MSKB) article
     305478, located at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305478/.
24
     Floppy disk drives are not present in many new computers, and it is anticipated that they will continue to
     decline in prevalence.


                                                         3-9
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


     a particular application on the computer requires the service to be enabled. Disabling this
     service does not prevent users on the local computer from connecting to other computers’
     shared files and printers.
 The Client for Microsoft Networks service, which allows a Windows XP Home Edition
     computer to use folders and printers that are shared by other computers on the local network.
     This service should only be enabled if the computer needs to access shared folders and
     printers, or if a particular application on the computer requires the service to be enabled.
     Disabling this service does not prevent the local computer from sharing its folders or printers
     with other computers on the local network.
3.1.3.2 Limit the Use of Remote Access Utilities

The Remote Assistance (RA) feature of Windows XP Home Edition provides a way to get
remote technical support assistance from a coworker, friend, or family member when running
into problems with a computer. 25 Users in need of assistance can send an invitation to start an
RA session through the Windows Messenger facility, e-mail requests, and via a Web e-mail
service (filling out a form to request assistance). Unfortunately, if RA is configured improperly,
unauthorized parties could use it to gain remote access to a computer. Therefore, RA should be
disabled except when needed.

Some users also acquire third-party utilities that permit remote access to the computer from other
computers. Although this may be convenient, it also increases the risk that the computer will be
accessed by remote unauthorized parties. Therefore, such utilities should be enabled only when
needed and configured to require authentication (e.g., username and password) before granting
remote access.

3.1.3.3 Configure Wireless Networking to Support Security

Wireless networking transfers information through the air between a user’s computer and a
device known as a wireless access point (AP). 26 If improperly configured, wireless networking
can cause sensitive information to be transmitted without adequate protection, exposing it to
others in close geographic proximity. Recommendations for wireless network security are as
follows: 27

 Use strong encryption to protect communications. To provide a better solution for
     wireless security, an industry group called the Wi-Fi Alliance has created a series of product
     certifications called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), which include the WPA1 and WPA2
     certifications. 28 Computers with wireless network cards that support either WPA1 or WPA2
25
     An overview of Remote Assistance is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/remoteassist/intro.mspx.
26
     A user’s computer can also wirelessly network with another user’s computer through what is known as an ad
     hoc wireless network. However, there are known security risks with ad hoc networks, so this guide does not
     recommend their use.
27
     Additional information is available from MSKB article 309369, available at
     http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309369/.
28
     The WPA1 certification is also known as WPA. For more information on WPA2, see MSKB article 893357,
     The Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)/Wireless Provisioning Services Information Element (WPS IE) Update
     for Windows XP with Service Pack 2 Is Available, which is located at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/893357/.


                                                       3-10
                                             GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


     can use their security features, such as using Advanced Encryption Security (AES) for
     encrypting network communications. Whenever available, users should choose 128-bit
     encryption or greater.
 Limit access to only specific wireless network cards. Some access points can be
     configured to allow only specific computers to have wireless network access. This is done
     by finding the media access control (MAC) address of each computer’s wireless network
     card and entering the MAC address into a list on the access point. Because a MAC address
     should be unique to a particular network card, this can be helpful in preventing unauthorized
     parties from gaining wireless network access.
 Require the use of a wired equivalent privacy (WEP) key. A WEP key is a series of
     letters, digits, and other characters that is used to limit access to wireless networks. A
     wireless access point can be configured to require all computers attempting to connect to it to
     use a WEP key. When a computer attempts to join the wireless network, it must provide the
     same WEP key as the one stored in the access point. Users should set a WEP key that is long
     and complex, making it hard for others to guess. This should help to prevent people in close
     physical proximity to the access point from gaining unauthorized access to the wireless
     network.
Windows XP Home Edition offers a feature called Wireless Auto Configuration that can be set
to automatically attempt to join any wireless networks it detects in an established list of preferred
networks. 29 By default, Windows XP Home Edition computers with SP2 will not attempt to
connect to any other networks automatically. This default setting should not be changed.
However, if the preferred networks cannot be found, by default the computer will attempt to
transmit identifier information to other wireless computers in the area using what is known as ad
hoc networking. An attacker could take advantage of this to establish unauthorized
communications with the computer. Windows XP Home Edition can be configured to prohibit
the use of ad hoc mode, preventing such attacks from succeeding.

3.1.3.4 Limit the Use of Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) allows a Windows XP Home Edition computer to share an
Internet connection with other computers. ICS is most often used in SOHO environments when
Internet access is available only through a dial-up modem in one computer. In such a situation,
ICS can allow multiple computers to share the limited Internet connectivity. If a higher-
bandwidth network is in use, such as DSL or cable modem service, it is generally easier to
purchase an inexpensive router or other network hardware device and use it to share access
among multiple computers. This allows each computer to access the Internet independently
without relying on another computer running ICS, and reduces the burden on the computer that
would have been running ICS. ICS should be disabled unless it is needed.

If ICS is used, the computer running ICS should use a personal firewall such as Windows
Firewall. Not only can the firewall provide protection for the ICS computer, but it can also help

29
     For more information on Wireless Auto Configuration, see the article Wireless XP Wireless Auto Configuration,
     which is available from Microsoft TechNet at
     http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cg1102.mspx.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


to protect the computers behind the ICS from attacks by external parties. Although ICS can
provide network address translation (NAT) services to other computers, which essentially hide
them from public view, NAT cannot protect computers against many types of threats.

3.1.4 File Extensions and Associations

The name of a file on a Windows XP Home Edition computer can have a file extension that is
supposed to indicate the file’s type. For example, the filename “readme.txt” has a file extension
of “.txt”, which is intended to mean that the file is a text file. By default, if a user double-clicks
on a file called “readme.txt”, Windows XP Home Edition attempts to open it in Notepad, which
is a text editing program. If a user double-clicks on a file called “readme.html”, by default
Windows XP Home Edition will assume that the file is a Web page and attempt to open it in a
Web browser. The mapping between a file extension and the software that attempts to run files
with that extension is known as a file association. By default, Windows XP Home Edition has
file associations for many common types of files. Figure 3-2 shows some of the default file
associations.

Although file associations are a convenient feature, they also pose some risk. For example, if a
person accidentally double-clicks on a piece of malware, it is likely that the malware will be
executed and attempt to infect the computer because of Windows XP Home Edition’s default file
associations. To prevent this, users should consider changing the default file associations for
files that are most likely to be used for malicious purposes and least likely to be used for
legitimate purposes. A list of these associations is presented in Appendix B. Typically, the
default file associations for these programs are changed so that files of those types are opened by
the Notepad application; this effectively neutralizes malicious files of those types. The Folder
Options area of Control Panel allows users to alter file associations.

Users should also alter another setting in Folder Options related to filenames. By default,
Windows XP Home Edition does not display mapped file extensions. Because of this, files
named “readme.txt” and “readme.exe” would both be displayed to users with just the filename
“readme”. Attackers can take advantage of the hidden file extensions to trick users into running
malicious files. 30 To thwart this, users should disable the Hide file extension for known file
types setting in Folder Options, which will cause file extensions to be displayed for nearly all
types of files. 31 This is most beneficial for users who are familiar with file extensions, but it
should also help other users.




30
     Microsoft describes how malware uses this technique at
     http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/prkd_tro_ecgm.asp.
31
     Some file extensions will continue to remain hidden from users, even when the Hide file extension for known
     file types setting is disabled. One example is shortcut files, which have a .lnk extension.

3.1.5 Services

By default, Windows XP Home Edition includes various built-in programs known as services
that support the operations of the computer. Most computers do not need to use all of these
services. Vulnerabilities are occasionally discovered in the services, so to reduce the possibility
of successful attacks, Windows XP Home Edition computers should only have the necessary
services enabled. On Windows XP Home Edition computers, the services that are the most
likely candidates for being disabled are as follows:

 ClipBook. This service permits users to share copied text and graphics with other users. It
   should be disabled unless there is a specific desire to share data through the Clipbook instead
   of other means, such as e-mail or Shared Folders.
 Infrared Monitor. Some computers have infrared sensors that permit them to interact with
   other computers, printers, and other computing devices in close proximity without being


                                                3-13
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      physically connected to each other. If there is no need to use a computer’s infrared sensor,
      this service should be disabled.
 NetMeeting Remote Desktop Sharing. This service is used for online conferencing with
      other people through audio, video, chat, and other means. It should be disabled if it is not
      needed. 32
 Routing and Remote Access. This service is only needed if the Internet Connection Sharing
      feature is needed, so it should be disabled if that feature is not being used.
 Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Device Host. This service is used primarily to allow a
      Windows XP Home Edition computer to interact with UPnP-enabled consumer electronics
      devices connected to the same local network. Unless this functionality is needed, the UPnP
      service and the SSDP Discovery Service should both be disabled. 33
 Wireless Zero Configuration. This service should be disabled on any computers that do not
      use wireless networking and enabled on any computers that do.
Appendix B.5 provides specific directions for disabling unneeded services.

3.2     Protecting Privacy

Windows XP Home Edition computers may contain a wide variety of sensitive user data, such as
personal correspondence, financial information, and healthcare information. If more than one
person may be using a computer, or the computer is at risk of being used by unauthorized people
(e.g., stolen from a public place), users may be concerned about protecting the privacy of their
data on the Windows XP Home Edition computer.

The primary location for user data on a Windows XP Home Edition computer is the directories
where users store their files. However, data may also reside in other locations. For example, the
Recycle Bin holds deleted files. If multiple people use the computer with the same shared user
account, they can access each others’ files in the Recycle Bin unless each person empties the
recycle bin after deleting files, or the users configure Windows XP Home Edition to delete files
immediately without storing them temporarily in the Recycle Bin. A disadvantage of these
settings is that if a person decides later that a file should not have been deleted, it has already
been purged from the computer.

The most important method of protecting privacy on a Windows XP Home Edition computer that
is used by multiple people is to have each person use a separate limited user account with a
password to access the computer. Each account is automatically set up with a separate personal
folder (as described in Section 3.1.2), Recycle Bin, temporary directory, and other resources, as
well as separate configuration settings (e.g., desktop, Web browser). Each account also has a
separate history of user actions, such as recently opened files, recently accessed Web pages, and
frequently used applications. This section recommends protective measures for users’ Web
browsers and files.
32
      More information on NetMeeting is available at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting/.
33
      For more information on UPnP, see the article Universal Plug and Play in Windows XP, which is available at
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/evaluate/upnpxp.mspx.


                                                       3-14
                                       GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


People who are installing Windows XP Home Edition or configuring new computers should
consider privacy when configuring each computer and its applications. For example, every
Windows XP Home Edition computer has a short text identifier known as a Computer Name.
This name might be visible to other computers on the same network, which could cause privacy
concerns. For example, if the computer is named after its owner, and it then joins a wireless
hotspot network, other people on that network might learn the owner’s name. Also, many
applications ask for a user’s name or initials during setup or initial use; this information might be
embedded in documents without the user realizing this is occurring. Accordingly, people who
are installing, configuring, or using computers and applications should keep privacy
considerations in mind when supplying any personal information.

3.2.1 Web Browsers

Web browsers may be used to access just about any type of information imaginable on Web
sites, as well as to use services such as online banking and shopping. Web browsers are also
frequently used to send and receive e-mail and to use newsgroups. As part of their normal
operations, Web browsers store different types of information related to using Web sites. If
multiple people use a single computer, particularly using the same user account, each user might
be able to gain access to Web browser usage-related information regarding the others. Web
browsers store different types of information in different places, including the following:

 History Files. A history file records all the Web sites that were visited recently, generally in
   the last two or three weeks, and also records the individual Web pages accessed at each site.
   Figure 3-3 shows a history window from Microsoft Internet Explorer. (The history windows
   offered by other Web browsers are similar in appearance and functionality.) Users can
   review the Web site history manually or perform searches for keywords. On Windows XP
   Home Edition computers, the history file includes not only Web activity, but also the names
   and locations of files opened on the computer by applications such as Microsoft Word and
   Adobe Reader.
 Browser Cache Files. To make Web browsing faster, browsers store Web pages that have
   been accessed in a cache on the local Windows XP Home Edition computer. The next time
   the page is needed, the Web browser can check to make sure the local copy of the page is still
   current, then display the local copy instead of downloading another copy from the remote
   Web site. Users that can access the folder holding the cache can look at the content of the
   files it contains. Web browsers typically have options that allow the user to clear the browser
   cache, deleting all the files.
 Cookies. Many Web sites place cookies on users’ computers; a cookie is a small file that
   stores information for a Web site. A persistent cookie stays on a computer to allow a Web
   site to identify the Web site’s user. Unfortunately, if someone else uses the same user
   account on the computer, some Web sites that use cookies may think that the two people are
   really the same person. The Web sites might then allow the second person to gain access to
   the first person’s information on the Web sites. Persistent cookies may also store sensitive
   information such as passwords or account numbers that could be accessed by other people
   using the same computer. Another type of cookie, a session cookie, is only valid for a single
   Web site session. Session cookies do not usually contain personal information. Most Web



                                                3-15
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


     browsers can be configured to permit all session cookies and to permit persistent cookies to
     be set only for the same Web site that the user visited (first-party cookies), not for the Web
     sites of advertisers and others (third-party cookies). This balances the preservation of users’
     privacy with the functionality that cookies can provide for Web site usage.




                                 Figure 3-3. Web Browser History Screen


Web browsers usually offer easy ways to delete the history file entries, browser cache files, and
cookies. Although this supports user privacy, it may also make the computer less user-friendly.
Deleting browser cache files means that all Web pages and page elements previously accessed
have to be downloaded again, which could significantly slow Web page access at first (especially
for dial-up users). Deleting cookies means that Web sites forget the preferences specified by
users. Erasing a history file does not simply clear the history listing; it also wipes out the list of
recently visited Web sites typically shown from the Web browser’s address bar. Many Web
browsers attempt to preserve the privacy of individual users by storing information separately,
but this might work only if each person uses a separate, password-protected user account.

Windows XP Home Edition offers a feature known as Stored User Names and Passwords. 34
This feature permits users to store authentication information—usernames and passwords—for
remote operating systems (e.g., virtual private networking, dial-up access) and Web sites. 35 For
example, when a user is prompted to enter a username and password to access a particular Web
site, the prompt window includes a dialog box labeled Remember my password. If the user
accepts the prompt and has the computer store the authentication information, anyone who gains

     For more information, see the Microsoft article Stored User Names and Passwords Overview at

unauthorized access on that computer as the user (e.g., walking up to an unattended workstation)
would then be able to use all resources to which the stored credential grants access.36

     Passwords should be stored only in environments in which there is a minimal physical
     threat, or where the password has trivial value (e.g., for a demo on a public Web site).
     Many Web browsers also offer the ability to store usernames and passwords, and the
     recommendations listed here for the Stored User Names and Passwords feature apply to
     Web browser password management as well.

3.2.2 Files

People often want to share files among computers because of the convenience. However, a
person typically does not want to share all of their files—for example, preventing others from
accessing files containing financial records and personal correspondence. This section explains
how Windows XP Home Edition computers can be configured to protect files that should remain
private and share files that should be available to others. Directions on implementing these
recommendations are provided in Section 5.4.3.

3.2.2.1 Protecting Files

As described in Section 3.1.1, having a separate user account for each person causes a My
Documents folder to be created for each user. By default, other users can see the contents of
this folder. Users can easily change this so that the contents are kept private: files placed in this
folder will not be accessible by other users of the computer. Although using a private My
Documents folder is a helpful measure to protect files, the files in it are still at risk. For example,
if the password for the user’s account is compromised, or the user uses the computer when it is
infected with malware, the files could be exposed to unauthorized parties. Also, anyone with
access to an administrative account on the computer can reset the password for a user account
and gain access to it and its files. Windows XP Home Edition does not provide stronger
mechanisms for file protection.

If protecting sensitive information in files is a concern, users should install third-party products
onto Windows XP Home Edition computers to provide file encryption capabilities. 37 File
encryption products are specifically designed to keep sensitive data private and unreadable by
unauthorized users. Some products encrypt individual files and protect the files no matter where
they are placed (e.g., e-mail attachment, CD-ROM). Other products encrypt many files
collectively and protect each file only as part of that collection; if a file is copied or moved

36
     If any usernames and passwords have accidentally been stored, they can be removed from the Control Panel.
     Double-click on the User Accounts icon and click on the appropriate user account. Under the Related Tasks
     pane, click on Manage my network passwords. For each stored password, select it and click the Remove
     button. When all stored passwords have been removed, click Close, and then close the User Accounts window
     and the Control Panel.
37
     Windows XP Professional systems include the Encrypting File System (EFS), a file encryption feature.
     However, EFS can only encrypt files that are stored on the local Windows XP Professional system. If there is a
     need to protect files no matter where they are located, such as stored on CDs or e-mailed to others, then third-
     party encryption software would need to be used instead of EFS. Third-party encryption software is also
     needed if the user wants to decrypt files that were encrypted on another computer and provided to the user
     through e-mail, removable media, or other means.


                                                        3-17
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


elsewhere, it is no longer protected by encryption. Before using any third-party encryption
product, users should carefully read the supporting information for the product and seek
assistance from others with experience as needed. File encryption can be very effective at
protecting sensitive data from access, modification, or deletion by malware and unauthorized
parties, particularly for computers at high risk of theft. However, file encryption can also cause
files to be inaccessible, such as a user that forgets an associated password or loses encryption
keys. Also, if a computer is compromised by malware or another form of attack, then all activity
on the computer might be monitored, including the decrypted files as they are used and modified
by their owners, and any passwords used to encrypt or decrypt files.

     Another measure that supports the protection of information is having a separate
     directory for temporary files for each user. Temporary files are created by applications
     such as word processors as part of their normal operations, and they may contain
     sensitive information. If an application fails to close properly, temporary files may be
     left on the computer instead of being deleted automatically. To prevent users from
     accessing others’ temporary files, each user should have a separate temporary directory.
     By default, Windows XP Home Edition provides a temporary directory for each user
     within the user profile’s directory.

3.2.2.2 Sharing Files

The Shared Folders feature of Windows XP Home Edition causes folders called Shared
Documents and Shared Pictures to be accessible by all users on the computer, but not remote
users. 38 This allows users to share files without sharing user accounts or permitting other users
to access their personal folders. 39 Unfortunately, Shared Folders cannot be configured to limit
access to some users; all users can read and modify all files in the shared folders. If more
restrictive sharing is needed, such as permitting all users to read but not modify files, users
should create their own folders and share them. 40 Figure 3-4 shows the available security
settings for a folder. A disadvantage of using a custom share is that it cannot be set up for just
local users of the computer; it must also be available to users on other computers.

The Simple File Sharing feature of Windows XP Home Edition, which is always enabled, allows
only the Guest account to be used to gain access to the computer through the network. This
means that attackers cannot gain remote access by guessing passwords to other accounts, such as
the Administrator account.




38
     The Shared Folders feature is always enabled unless the filesystem is not formatted as NTFS.
39
     More information on Windows XP file sharing is available from MSKB article 304040, How to Configure File
     Sharing in Windows XP, available at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304040/.
40
     If more restrictive sharing is needed, such as allowing only some users to have access, or allowing some users
     to have read access while others have read and modify access, alternate solutions need to be used. One
     possibility is to use a third-party encryption program that prevents access to the files without knowing a
     password or possessing a cryptographic key; another possibility is to store the files on removable media (e.g.,
     flash drive, CD) and store the media in a protected place that only the appropriate people can access.

3.3     Stopping Attacks

This section describes software and software features that are designed specifically to stop some
local attacks and most network attacks against a computer, such as malware, spyware, and
automated scanning and attack tools. As explained in Section 2, there is no 100% solution to
computer security; although having multiple layers of defense provides a much stronger solution
than a single layer of defense, it is simply not possible to thwart every single attack. Windows
XP Home Edition computers should use a combination of software and software features that
will stop some local attacks and most network attacks, particularly malware. Software described
in this section includes antivirus software, personal firewalls, spam and Web content filtering,
and popup blocking. Users can also change a few settings on common applications such as e-
mail clients and Web browsers to stop some attacks.

Windows XP Home Edition has a built-in utility called the Security Center, which is shown in
Figure 3-5. 41 It provides a single interface for the status of the computer’s antivirus software,
personal firewall, and Automatic Updates feature. Security Center monitors these constantly to
ensure that they are enabled properly and kept up-to-date. 42 If Security Center detects a problem

41
      More information on Security Center is available from the article Windows Security Center—Managing the
      State of Security, which is available at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/wscoverview.mspx.
42
      Not all antivirus software and personal firewalls may be capable of providing accurate status information to
      Security Center. If in doubt about the status of a particular security tool, check the status provided by that tool
      itself.


                                                           3-19

with one of these security tools, it notifies the user at login and displays a red icon in the taskbar
to alert the user of the issue. This can be very helpful to users in identifying security software
misconfigurations and failures quickly.




                                     Figure 3-5. Security Center


Although security tools can stop many attacks, users also need to practice safe computing habits.
One of the most common ways that computers are attacked is by users opening and executing
files from unknown and untrusted sources. Users may download these files from Web sites, file
sharing services, or other means, or they may be sent to users through e-mail, instant messaging,
and other communications services. These files often contain malware, and users unknowingly
infect their computers by trying to use these files. Users should be very cautious about any files
that are coming from unknown and untrusted sources, and it is generally prudent to avoid such
files.

3.3.1 Malware Protection

The most common tool for providing protection against malware is antivirus software, which is
specifically designed to detect many forms of malware and prevent them from infecting
computers, as well as cleaning computers that have already been infected. Windows XP Home


                                                 3-20

Edition does not have built-in antivirus software. Because malware is the most common threat
against Windows XP Home Edition computers, and antivirus software is the most effective
protective measure against malware, NIST strongly recommends that every Windows XP Home
Edition computer use antivirus software at all times. 43 Also, because antivirus software is
updated frequently by vendors (sometimes more than once a day) so it can identify the latest
malware threats, NIST also strongly recommends that users keep their antivirus software up-to-
date. 44 Antivirus software cannot provide complete protection against malware threats, so users
still need to follow other good computing practices to help prevent malware infections, as
described in Section 7.

There are many brands of antivirus software available, which offer similar functionality. NIST
recommends configuring antivirus software to use several types of functions, including the
following:

 Scanning critical operating system components such as startup files, system basic
     input/output system (BIOS), and boot records
 Performing real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened, or executed, which is
     known as on-access scanning
 Monitoring the behavior of common applications, such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, file
     transfer and file sharing programs, and instant messaging software
 Scanning files for known viruses. Antivirus software on computers should be configured to
     scan all hard drives regularly to identify any file system infections, and optionally to scan
     other storage media as well. Users should also be able to launch scans manually as needed,
     which is known as on-demand scanning.
 Handling files that are infected. Antivirus software can do this in two ways: disinfecting
     files, which refers to removing malware from within a file, and quarantining files, which
     means that files containing malware are stored in isolation for future disinfection or
     examination. Disinfecting a file is generally preferable to quarantining it because the
     malware is removed and the original file restored; however, many infected files cannot be
     disinfected. Accordingly, antivirus software should be configured to quarantine infected files
     and to attempt to disinfect them.
 Logging all significant events, such as the results of scans, the startup and shutdown of
     antivirus software, the installation of updates, and the discovery and handling of any
     instances of malware


43
     Microsoft provides its Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool for Windows XP Home Edition computers.
     It is distributed for free along with Windows XP Home Edition updates, as described in Section 3.1.1. This tool
     is a form of antivirus software that looks for and attempts to remove certain common threats. Because it does
     not contain a comprehensive list of known malware threats, it is not a substitute for a full-fledged antivirus
     software program; rather, it should be thought of as a supplement. More information on the Windows
     Malicious Software Removal Tool is available at
     http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx.

                                                       3-21
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Automatically downloading and installing updates from the vendor daily.

Most antivirus products can identify several types of malware, including viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and malicious mobile code. 45 Antivirus products offer varying levels of support for
detecting spyware. Separate antispyware utilities should be used to supplement any antivirus
products that do not have robust spyware handling capabilities. Unlike antivirus software, which
attempts to identify many types of malware, antispyware utilities specialize in both malware and
non-malware forms of spyware. Although some antispyware utilities specialize in a particular
form of spyware, such as browser plug-ins, most can detect many types of spyware and offer
similar features to antivirus software. The same updating and configuration recommendations
made earlier in this section for antivirus software also apply to antispyware utilities.

Microsoft offers a free antispyware program for Windows XP Home Edition computers. The
program, Microsoft Windows Defender, has not yet been finalized, but a preliminary test version
of it known as a beta is available until the final version is ready. 46 The second test version of the
software, known as Beta 2, cannot detect some common forms of spyware that other antispyware
programs can, such as tracking cookies. Accordingly, users should use the second beta version
of the program in conjunction with another antispyware program for better overall detection of
spyware.

Section 5.3.1 provides additional information on recommended malware protection practices.

3.3.2 Personal Firewalls

A personal firewall is a software program that monitors communications between a computer
and other computers (e.g., a Windows XP Home Edition computer and computers on the
Internet) and blocks communications that are unwanted. When properly configured, a personal
firewall limits the access that other computers have to the Windows XP Home Edition computer
through the network. This can significantly reduce the exposure of the computer to network-
based attacks such as worms. A personal firewall can also be used to protect shared resources
(e.g., file and print shares) on a computer. Accordingly, a personal firewall should be installed
and enabled on every Windows XP Home Edition computer. 47 Personal firewalls should be
configured to log significant events, such as blocked activity, the startup and shutdown of the
firewall software, and firewall configuration changes.

Although personal firewalls are one of the most important security controls for Windows XP
Home Edition computers, they can be relatively difficult to configure correctly. If a personal
firewall is configured to be too restrictive, it could prevent certain user applications or Windows
XP Home Edition functions from working correctly. For example, a personal firewall might

45
     A virus is a program that self-replicates—makes copies of itself—by infecting files and distributing copies of
     itself to other files, programs, or computers. A worm is a self-replicating program that is completely self-
     contained and self-propagating. A Trojan horse is a program that appears to be benign but actually has a hidden
     malicious purpose. Malicious mobile code is software that is transmitted from a remote computer to be run on
     the local computer for malicious purposes, typically without the user’s explicit instruction or knowledge.
46
     The Microsoft Windows Defender home site contains information on the software and also makes it available
     for download. The site is located at http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx.
47
     Microsoft recommendations on personal firewalls are available from the Security Guide for Small Business,
     which is available for download at http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/support/security-toolkit-pdf.mspx.


                                                       3-22
                                            GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


prevent the use of Microsoft file and print services. On the other hand, if a personal firewall is
configured to be too permissive, it could permit attacks to compromise the computer. Users
should read all personal firewall documentation carefully to gain a solid understanding of how it
should be configured. If it is not clear, users should seek expert guidance on configuring their
personal firewalls.

Ideally, firewalls should deny all types of communications that have not specifically been
approved by the administrator or users as being permitted. This is known as a deny by default
configuration, because all communications that are not on the exception list are denied
automatically. Most firewalls can be configured to allow communications based on lists of
authorized applications, such as Web browsers contacting Web servers and e-mail clients
sending and receiving e-mail messages. Activity involving any other application is either denied
automatically, or permitted or denied based on the user responding to a prompt asking for a
decision regarding the activity. For example, if a user runs a new application that was just
installed on the computer, the firewall might ask the user if it is acceptable for that application to
access the Internet. To prevent malware incidents, users should configure personal firewalls as
deny by default, so that they permit only the communications desired by the users.

Windows XP Home Edition includes a personal firewall called Windows Firewall.48 It can be
configured to restrict all inbound communications—those initiated by other computers.
Windows Firewall is enabled by default for each network interface, including wired and wireless
network cards, dial-up modems, and virtual private networks (VPN). When configured properly,
Windows Firewall can restrict access to Microsoft networking services so that remote computers
and malware cannot reach them. Windows Firewall also supports the creation of multiple
firewall profiles, so that a computer used in different environments (e.g., home network, wireless
hotspot) can have a different personal firewall configuration for each environment.

There are many third-party personal firewall products available that can be used instead of
Windows Firewall. Some of these products offer more robust capabilities, such as filtering and
blocking unauthorized outbound communications—those initiated by malicious activity (e.g.,
malware) on the Windows XP Home Edition computer. This is particularly helpful in detecting
that a computer has been compromised. For example, if a computer is infected with a worm, it is
likely that the computer will try to initiate connections to other computers to spread itself. If a
properly configured personal firewall is monitoring outbound communications, it should see the
worm activity and stop it, both alerting the user to the problem and preventing other computers
from becoming infected. Some third-party firewalls also offer other security controls, such as
popup ad blocking or Web content filtering (which are described later in this section).

Windows XP Home Edition computers should only have a single personal firewall enabled. If
two or more firewalls are enabled, they are likely to interfere with each other. For example, one
firewall might block activity that the other firewall has been configured to allow, or one firewall
might allow activity that the other one has been configured to block. This could slow the

48
     Windows Firewall was added to Windows XP in Service Pack 2. For more information on Windows Firewall,
     visit http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/internet/sp2_wfintro.mspx. Before SP2, the built-in
     firewall was called the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF). For more information on ICF, read Microsoft
     Knowledge Base (MSKB) article 320855, Description of the Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall,
     available at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320855/.


                                                      3-23
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


performance of the computer and cause applications to stop functioning properly, as well as
weaken the computer’s security.

Section 5.2.1 has more detailed information on configuring personal firewalls.

In addition to using personal firewalls, many people use a small, inexpensive device called a
firewall appliance or firewall router to protect the computers on their home networks from
threats outside the network. A firewall appliance performs similar functions to a personal
firewall, and it can provide protection for multiple computers on a home network. Even if each
computer on a home network is using a personal firewall, a firewall appliance is still a valuable
additional layer of security. Should a personal firewall on a computer malfunction, be disabled,
or be misconfigured, the firewall appliance can still protect the computer from unauthorized
network communications from external computers. 49 However, in most cases the firewall
appliance cannot provide any protection for communications between computers on the home
network. For example, if one computer becomes infected, the firewall appliance cannot prevent
the infection from spreading to other computers on the home network because it has no control
over their communications. Also, firewall appliances typically do not block any communications
from the home network computers to external computers, so if a home network computer
becomes compromised and is used to attack other computers, a firewall appliance probably
cannot stop that attack.

3.3.3 Content Filtering

Content filtering is the process of monitoring communications such as e-mail and Web pages,
analyzing them for suspicious content, and preventing the delivery of suspicious content to users.
The two most common types of content filtering are as follows:

 Spam Filtering Software. Spam—unsolicited e-mail—is often used to deliver spyware and
     other forms of malware to users. Spam is also frequently used for performing phishing
     attacks. Spam filtering software analyzes e-mails to look for characteristics of spam, and
     typically places messages that appear to be spam in a separate e-mail folder. Because spam
     filtering is subjective, some spam will still reach users, and some desired e-mail messages
     will accidentally be classified as spam. Still, spam filtering software can significantly reduce
     the amount of spam that reaches users, leading to a corresponding decline in spam-triggered
     malware incidents. Many e-mail clients also offer some helpful spam filtering capabilities.
     Also, some ISPs offer spam filtering services for their e-mail users; in addition to identifying
     previously known spam, such services can also identify new spam that is sent to many
     customers at the same time.
 Web Content Filtering Software. Web content filtering software typically works by
     comparing a Web site address that a user attempts to access to a list of known bad Web sites.
     Although the primary purpose of Web content filtering software is to prevent access to
     materials that are considered inappropriate, many also contain lists of Web sites that are
     known as hostile, such as those that attempt to distribute malware to visitors or host phishing

49
     A detailed discussion of firewall appliances is outside the scope of this publication. Guidance on home network
     security is provided in NIST SP 800-46, Security for Telecommuting and Broadband Communications
     (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-46/sp800-46.pdf).


                                                       3-24
                                      GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   Web sites. Web content filtering software might inadvertently classify benign content as
   inappropriate, or vice versa.
From a Windows XP Home Edition security perspective, spam content filtering technologies are
strongly recommended for all e-mail use, and Web content filtering technologies can also be
helpful but are considered optional. Any content filtering products that are used should be kept
up-to-date so that their detection is as accurate as possible. Section 5.3.2 provides more
information on configuring spam and Web content filtering software.

3.3.4 Popup Blocking

Nearly all Web browsers support the use of popup windows, which are standalone Web browser
panes that open automatically when a Web page is loaded or a user performs an action designed
to trigger a popup window. Many popup windows contain advertising, but they are increasingly
being used as a way to attack computers. Some popup windows are crafted to look like
legitimate system message boxes or Web sites, and can trick users into going to phony Web sites,
including sites used for phishing, or authorizing changes to their computers, among other
malicious actions. For example, a popup window may tell a user that the computer is infected
with spyware and to click on OK to disinfect it. By clicking on OK, the user unwittingly permits
spyware or other types of malware to be installed on the computer.

To control popup windows, various third-party popup blocking utilities were created. Most Web
browsers also offer popup blocking capabilities. Generally, these utilities and features prevent
popup windows from opening, and indicate to the user that a popup window was blocked. If the
user did not want the window to be blocked, he can then choose to permit that particular popup
window or to permit all popup windows from a trusted Web site. Because popup windows can
be a nuisance as well as a security risk, they should be blocked by default on Windows XP Home
Edition computers, either by configuring Web browser features or by using third-party utilities.
Section 7.3 provides general instructions on configuring popup blocking.

3.3.5 Security Software Suites

Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 have described several types of software that can be helpful for
protecting Windows XP Home Edition computers. Originally, each type of software was created
as a separate, standalone product. As users needed to acquire more security products for their
computers, vendors began creating security software suites that incorporate several types of
security software in a single integrated product. For example, several vendors offer suites that
include antivirus software, antispyware software, a personal firewall, a Web browser popup
blocker, spam filtering, and Web content filtering. Some suites offer additional functions, such
as managing Web browser cookies and identifying potential privacy issues within Web pages
and e-mails.

Suites offer a few advantages over purchasing components separately. Generally, a suite costs
much less than the individual components would. It is also more convenient to purchase and
install a single product than several separate products. Updating and maintaining a suite is also
simpler and quicker than doing so for several products. Another advantage of using a suite is
that conflicts or incompatibilities between components are unlikely; when separate products are



                                               3-25
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


used on the same computer, problems between products are more likely. The primary
disadvantage of using a suite is that one or more suite components might not be as effective, easy
to use, full-featured, or efficient as competing standalone products. However, in many cases,
suites are easier to use than individual products because all suite components have the same user
interface.

3.3.6 Application Configuration

Many attacks, particularly malware, take advantage of features provided by common
applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, instant messaging clients, and office
productivity suites. By default, applications often are configured to favor functionality over
security. Accordingly, users should consider disabling unneeded features and capabilities from
applications, particularly those that are commonly exploited by malware. Users should also
consider configuring applications to filter content and stop other activity that is likely to be
malicious. Examples of application settings to consider in malware incident prevention are listed
below. Users should be aware that a single computer might have multiple Web browsers, e-mail
clients, instant messaging clients, and office productivity suites installed, each of which may
have different features and configuration settings. More details on configuration settings are
available in Section 7.
3.3.6.1 Web Browsers

 Restricting Web browser cookies. See Section 3.2.1 for additional information.

 Preventing software installation within Web browsers. Some Web browsers can be
   configured to prompt the user to approve the installation of software such as Web browser
   plug-ins. Some browsers can even prevent Web sites from installing software on the client.
   These settings are particularly helpful for preventing the installation of spyware within Web
   browsers.
 Limiting mobile code execution. Most Web browsers can be configured to allow, limit, or
   deny the use of certain types of mobile code (e.g., JavaScript, ActiveX, Java). Mobile code
   is a way for a remote computer, such as a Web site, to run programs on a user’s local
   Windows XP Home Edition computer. Although limiting or denying mobile code use can
   provide stronger security, typically this interferes with needed Web browser functionality.
 Blocking popup windows. See Section 3.3.4 for information on this.

3.3.6.2 E-Mail Clients

 Preventing automatic loading of e-mail images. Most e-mail clients can be configured not
   to load graphics contained within e-mails automatically. This is particularly helpful for
   thwarting e-mail-based Web bugs. With this configuration setting, the outline of an unloaded
   Web bug appears as a small box within the e-mail, and the user’s activity cannot be tracked
   unless the user chooses to have the image loaded.
 Limiting mobile code execution. Most e-mail clients can be configured to permit only the
   required forms of mobile code. This can be effective at stopping some instances of malicious
   mobile code.


                                              3-26
                                      GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Setting default message reading format and sending format to plain text. Most e-mail
   clients allow users to specify the default format for reading and sending e-mails. The most
   commonly used formats are plain text and HTML. Because malware, phishing, and other
   types of attacks often take advantage of features offered by HTML, it is preferable to set the
   default message format to plain text. This will cause e-mails to be displayed as text only,
   which means that pictures, hyperlinks, and other content provided through HTML are
   omitted or displayed only through alternative text. Also, sending e-mails as plain text is
   helpful to other users who are security-conscious and prefer to read e-mail messages in plain
   text.
 Disabling automatic opening of e-mail messages. Some e-mail-based malware may be
   activated and infect a computer when the malicious e-mail is opened. Many e-mail clients
   can be configured to open e-mail messages automatically. This can provide an easy way for
   malware to infect a computer. Accordingly, e-mail clients should be configured not to open
   e-mail messages automatically. This gives users an opportunity to identify and delete an e-
   mail that appears to be suspicious based on the sender, recipient, subject, and other
   identifying information that can be reviewed without opening the e-mail.
 Enabling spam filtering. Section 3.3.3 has additional information on this.

3.3.6.3 Instant Messaging Clients

 Suppressing the display of e-mail addresses. If the user’s displayed name or supporting
   information includes an e-mail address, this may be harvested by malware or malicious users,
   then used in future attacks.
 Restricting file transfers. If the software can transfer files with other instant messaging
   users, it should be configured to prompt the user before permitting a file transfer to begin.
   File transfers are a common way to transfer malware to other computers and infect them.
3.3.6.4 Office Productivity Suites

 Restricting macro use. Applications such as word processors and spreadsheets often
   contain macro languages; macro viruses take advantage of this. Most common applications
   with macro capabilities offer security features that permit macros only from trusted locations
   or prompt the user to approve or reject each attempt to run a macro. The prompting feature
   can be very effective at stopping macro-based malware threats.
 Limit personal information. Many office productivity tools allow personal information,
   such as name, initials, mailing address, and phone number, to be stored with each document
   created. Although the most basic information (typically, name and initials) are often needed
   for collaboration features and edit tracking, information such as mailing addresses and phone
   numbers is not. Personal information becomes embedded within document files and may
   inadvertently be distributed with files to others. If privacy is a concern, then users should not
   enter any more personal information than necessary into the user settings of office
   productivity tools.
 Use secured folders for application files. Most office productivity applications allow users
   to define default locations for saving documents and holding temporary files, including auto-


                                               3-27
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      save and backup copies of documents. This can be very helpful at protecting application files
      from unauthorized access by others. Users should also store their custom dictionary entries
      in a user-specific file stored in one of their protected folders.

3.3.7 Data Execution Prevention

Windows XP Home Edition offers a feature known as Data Execution Prevention (DEP). When
enabled, this feature prevents software on the computer from performing certain actions that
could cause problems. For example, DEP could stop certain types of malware from successfully
infecting a computer. Different computers offer varying levels of support for DEP based on their
processors. Because DEP limits what software can do, unfortunately there might be occasional
conflicts between DEP and certain applications, causing those applications to malfunction.
Accordingly, users should consider enabling DEP on their computers, and if DEP is enabled,
users should monitor their computers for application conflicts and disable DEP if necessary.
Appendix B.1 contains instructions for configuring DEP.

3.4     Preserving Data

A Windows XP Home Edition computer could stop functioning properly or have corrupted data
due to several causes, including the following:

 Attack against the computer, such as malware
                                                50
 Hardware, software, or power failure

 Natural disaster, such as a fire or flood

 Human error.

To ensure that user data is available after an unfortunate event, users or administrators should
periodically duplicate data from Windows XP Home Edition computers onto another medium,
such as a CD-ROM or flash drive. This process is known as a backup. Transferring the data
from the medium back to the computer is known as a restore. User data should be backed up
periodically, such as weekly or monthly. Administrators may also wish to back up the Windows
XP Home Edition files themselves occasionally, to assist in rebuilding the computer should
Windows XP Home Edition need to be reinstalled. Users or administrators should also verify
periodically that backups can be restored successfully; backing up a computer regularly may not
be beneficial if the backups are corrupt or the wrong files are being backed up. Because backups
may contain sensitive user data, backup media should be properly protected to prevent
unauthorized access.

There are several options for performing backups and restores on Windows XP Home Edition
computers. This section describes each option; additional details on implementing them are
available in Section 4.2.

      An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and surge protection device can provide temporary emergency battery
      power when the utility-provided power is unavailable.

3.4.1 Backup or Restore Wizard

Windows XP Home Edition CDs contain a program called the Backup or Restore Wizard.
Although this program is not installed as part of Windows XP Home Edition by default, it is
available to all Windows XP Home Edition users. The Backup or Restore Wizard automates
most of the backup and restore processes. For example, during a backup the user is presented
with several options, including backing up the current user’s files and settings, backing up all
users’ files and settings, and backing up the whole computer. This allows the user to back up
data and operating systems without having to manually indicate which files and directories
should be backed up, if the user’s files are where the backup program expects them to be. When
a backup is performed, the result is a .bkf file (Backup.bkf by default). As the name indicates,
the Backup or Restore Wizard can also be used to restore a backup from a .bkf file.

If a full backup is performed, the Automated System Recovery Wizard will prompt the user to
insert a floppy disk, which is intended to be turned into a recovery disk that could be used with
the .bkf file to restore the computer in case of failure. However, even though creating this
recovery disk appears to be feasible, Automated System Recovery is not fully supported by
Windows XP Home Edition. 51 It may be possible to create the recovery disk, but Windows XP
Home Edition does not allow it to be used to recover the system from a failure. Therefore, the
Automated System Recovery Wizard and other Windows XP Home Edition features and options
related to Automated System Recovery should not be used.

When the Backup or Restore Wizard is run, it presents an option to select Advanced Mode. 52
This switches to the Backup Utility interface, which is not as user-friendly but provides greater
customizability and more features. For example, the Backup Utility can be used to schedule
backups. In general, only the most technically adept users and administrators are more likely to
use the Backup Utility mode, while others are more likely to use the Backup or Restore Wizard
mode.

3.4.2 Files and Settings Transfer Wizard

Another utility included with Windows XP Home Edition is the Files and Settings Transfer
Wizard. 53 The wizard can back up files and settings for Windows XP Home Edition and
applications. Examples of settings the wizard can back up include network configurations,
desktop settings (e.g., wallpaper, screen resolution), e-mail client configuration, and Web
browser bookmarks. The wizard can save the files and settings to removable media or a shared
folder on another computer on the network.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


Unlike the Backup or Restore Wizard, the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard can only back up
data for a single user at a time, and it cannot make a backup of the whole computer. In case of
computer failure, a user would need to reinstall Windows XP Home Edition and all needed
applications, in addition to restoring all users’ backups performed by the Files and Settings
Transfer Wizard. An advantage of using the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard is that it should
require much less media storage space than the Backup or Restore Wizard.

3.4.3 Third-Party Backup and Restore Utility

There are various third-party utilities, known as backup utilities or drive imaging utilities, for
backing up and restoring files and operating systems. If a third-party utility is to be used, it is
important to first verify that it can properly back up and restore Windows XP-specific resources,
such as the Windows registry, which stores configuration information for Windows XP Home
Edition, applications, and users. The Backup or Restore Wizard built into Windows XP Home
Edition uses a shadow copy backup technique when possible, which means that it essentially
takes a snapshot of the computer and then perform a backup on that snapshot. This avoids
problems with attempting to back up files that are currently in use, also known as open files.
Third-party backup utilities used on Windows XP Home Edition computers should have good
mechanisms for handling open files.

3.4.4 Third-Party Remote Backup Service

Commercial vendors offer remote backup services over the Internet. Users typically install an
agent program on their Windows XP Home Edition computers and configure the agent to back
up their data periodically over the Internet to remote storage. The use of such services is usually
practical only for users with high-speed Internet connections. Because users are entrusting the
security of their data to the remote backup service provider, users should research the security
precautions performed by the provider, and should consider using third-party file encryption
software on their computers to protect any sensitive information before sending it to the remote
backup service provider.

3.4.5 File Copy to Media

In the simplest cases, no utility may be needed at all to perform a backup. For example, if a
computer contains a few folders with data that should be backed up, and users do not want to
have their custom settings preserved, it should be sufficient to copy files onto a writable CD or
DVD, flash drive, or other removable media. Should the computer be damaged or require
Windows XP Home Edition to be reinstalled, this backup method would preserve only those files
specifically copied to the media. This backup method also relies on users to be aware of exactly
where all of their files are located on the computer.

3.5   Summary

Security protections are measures that thwart threats. Windows XP Home Edition computers
should be secured using a combination of technical and operational protections, such as antivirus
software, Windows XP Home Edition configuration settings, and user education and security



                                               3-30
                                       GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


awareness activities. Because new vulnerabilities in software are discovered on an ongoing
basis, security protections should be updated on a regular basis.

One of the most important parts of securing a Windows XP Home Edition computer is
eliminating known weaknesses, because attackers could attempt to take advantage of them. Five
categories of methods for eliminating weaknesses are as follows:

 Limiting access to the computer through separate password-protected user accounts for each
   person, with different accounts for administrative and daily tasks (a limited user account)
 Applying software updates to the computer on a regular basis, including Windows XP Home
   Edition and software applications
 Limiting network access by disabling unneeded networking features, limiting the use of
   remote access utilities and Internet Connection Sharing, and configuring wireless networking
   securely
 Modifying default file associations and the display of default file extensions

 Disabling services that are not needed.

Another concern in securing a Windows XP Home Edition computer is protecting the privacy of
user data, such as personal correspondence and financial information. The most important
method of protecting privacy is to have each person use a separate password-protected user
account. Each account has a separate personal folder, Recycle Bin, temporary directory, and
configuration settings. The personal folder and the files within it can be protected from access
by other users of the computer. Users can also share files with each other, including users on
other computers on the local network.

Another important component of Windows XP Home Edition security is using a combination of
software and software features that are designed specifically to stop attacks, particularly
malware. Every Windows XP Home Edition computer should use antivirus software,
antispyware software, and a personal firewall at all times, and they should be kept up-to-date.
Other helpful software includes spam and Web content filtering and popup blocking. Users can
also change settings on common applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, instant
messaging clients, and office productivity suites to stop some attacks.

Users or administrators of a Windows XP Home Edition computer should periodically duplicate
data from the computer onto another medium, such as a CD-ROM or flash drive. This process,
known as a backup, helps to ensure that user data is available after an unfortunate event such as
an attack against the computer, a hardware failure, a natural disaster, or human error. User data
should be backed up periodically, such as weekly or monthly. There are several options for
performing backups on Windows XP Home Edition computers, including utilities built into
Windows XP Home Edition, and third-party utilities and remote backup services.

The five most important protections that should be used for Windows XP Home Edition
computers connecting to the Internet are as follows:

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Using a personal firewall that is configured to restrict incoming network activity to only that
   which is required
 Using a limited user account for typical daily use of the computer

 Running up-to-date antivirus software and antispyware software that is configured to monitor
   the computer and applications often used to spread malware (e.g., e-mail, Web) and to
   quarantine or delete any identified malware
 Applying updates to the operating system and major applications (e.g., e-mail clients, Web
   browsers) regularly, preferably through automated means that check for updates frequently
 Performing regular backups so that data can be restored in case an adverse event occurs.

4.     Installing Windows XP Home Edition
This section of the guide provides guidance and step-by-step instructions for installing Windows
XP Home Edition. This guide assumes that Windows XP Home Edition is being installed or
reinstalled on the computer, which means that all existing operating system settings,
applications, and data on the computer are destroyed unless first backed up to removable media
or otherwise preserved. The alternative to performing a full installation is doing an upgrade of
the existing operating system (e.g., Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition [ME]). 54
Upgrading an existing computer can result in different security configuration settings than the
default Windows XP Home Edition settings; as a result, using the advice in this guide on an
upgraded computer may be inappropriate and could possibly cause problems. Also, the
instructions in this section should not be used on any computer that is or will be dual booting,
which means that a single computer has another operating system installed in addition to
Windows XP Home Edition (e.g., Linux, Unix, another version of Windows).

If the computer has been used previously, it may contain user data (e.g., e-mails, documents),
application configuration settings (e.g., Web browser bookmarks), or other information that
needs to be preserved before Windows XP Home Edition is installed or reinstalled onto the
computer. In that case, the person performing the Windows XP Home Edition installation
should follow a five-phase process:

     1. Prepare for the Installation. This involves basic preparatory actions, such as gathering
        the software media and documentation that will be needed for the installation.

     2. Back Up Data and Configuration Files. This focuses on the transfer of user data and
        configuration settings from the computer to external media, such as CD-ROMs or flash
        drives.

     3. Install Windows XP Home Edition. This is the actual installation of Windows XP
        Home Edition.

     4. Secure the Computer. This involves performing various actions to secure Windows XP
        Home Edition, such as applying service packs and software updates.

     5. Restore Data and Configuration Files. This causes the user data and configuration
        settings that were backed up during phase 2 to be transferred back to the computer.

If there is no need to preserve data and configuration settings from the existing computer, the
user should omit phase 2 (Back Up Data and Configuration Files) and phase 5 (Restore Data and
Configuration Files).




54
     It is not possible to upgrade certain versions of Windows, such as Windows 95 and Windows 2000, to Windows
     XP Home Edition.


                                                      4-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



4.1     Prepare for the Installation

The first thing the user should do is perform some simple preparatory steps, as follows:

      1. Determine which software applications (and versions of each) are installed on the
         computer. These may include Web browsers, e-mail clients, office productivity tools
         (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets), instant messaging software, multimedia utilities
         (e.g., audio and video players), graphics tools, and security software (e.g., antivirus
         software, personal firewall). The two primary ways of identifying the installed
         applications are as follows:

           From the Control Panel, run the Add or Remove Programs utility. It shows which
              software applications, security updates, hardware drivers, and other types of programs
              are installed on the computer.
           Review the folders and icons on the Start Menu and the Desktop, in particular the All
              Programs shortcut on the Start Menu, to find application shortcuts listed there.
      2. Document critical settings for the OS and applications. This should include any
         information needed to connect to the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP), as well as
         usernames or server names or addresses for applications. Examples are as follows:

           Network configuration information from an ISP, if the ISP does not provide this
              information automatically when the computer connects. Examples of network
              configuration information include a statically assigned IP address for the computer,
              default gateway IP address, and DNS server names or addresses.
           E-mail server names stored in e-mail clients.

           Usernames or nicknames used for e-mail, instant messaging programs, and other
              applications.
      3. Gather the necessary software. 55 This usually includes, but is not limited to, the
         following:

           Windows XP Home Edition CD and the Product Key (a series of letters and numbers
              in the format XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX) 56
           Windows XP service packs on CD, if Internet connectivity is low-bandwidth (e.g.,
              dial-up modem). Microsoft provides Windows XP Service Pack 2 on CD for free. 57

55
      Only copies of Windows XP Home Edition that are properly licensed for the computer should be used. For
      more information on Windows XP Home Edition licensing, visit Microsoft’s Software Piracy Protection Web
      site at http://www.microsoft.com/piracy/default.mspx.
56
      Some computer vendors do not provide a Windows XP Home Edition CD to their customers. One common
      alternative is to provide a system CD that installs Windows XP Home Edition and various third-party
      applications. Using such a system CD involves using the vendor’s instructions in place of portions of the
      directions presented in Section 4.3. Some computer vendors do not provide operating system CDs with their
      computers; instead, the computer has software on its hard drive with which the user can create a system CD.
      Also, some vendors’ versions of Windows XP Home Edition CDs do not include Product Keys.


                                                        4-2

           CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, and other media provided by the computer manufacturer
              and hardware add-on manufacturers (e.g., printers, scanners, digital cameras)
           CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, and other media for the software applications identified in
              step 1
      4. Gather the documentation for the computer and hardware and software added onto the
         computer, in case any issues arise during the installation.

      5. Acquire media, such as blank writable CDs or DVDs, an external backup disk drive, or
         flash drives, that can be used for backing up data and configuration files, if needed.

4.2     Back Up Data Files and Configuration Settings

This step involves backing up any information that needs to be preserved from a previously used
computer. (If the computer is new or does not contain any needed information, skip to Section
4.3.) Choose a backup method based on the information presented in Section 3.4, then perform
the following steps:

      1. Find the needed files and/or configuration settings to be backed up.

      2. Transfer the files to media and verify the backup using the chosen method:

          a. Backup or Restore Wizard

               i. By default, the backup utility is not installed with Windows XP Home Edition.
                  Before performing a backup for the first time, the user needs to load the backup
                  utility onto the computer. This can be done using the following steps:

                   1. Insert the Windows XP Home Installation CD into the CD drive.

                   2. Open My Computer. Right-click on the CD-ROM drive and select
                      Explore. Find the file located at
                      \VALUEADD\MSFT\NTBACKUP\NTBACKUP.msi. Double-click it.

                   3. The backup utility installation wizard should begin.

                   4. When the wizard is complete, click Finish.

               ii. Go to Start, then All Programs, and choose Accessories. Next, select System
                   Tools, and click on the Backup icon. This should launch the Backup or Restore
                   Wizard.

              iii. Click the Advanced Mode link. Click on the icon for Backup Wizard
                   (Advanced), then click Next.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


              iv. The What to Back Up window appears, asking the user what should be backed
                  up:

                        The Back up everything on this computer option can be used by a person
                        logged in with an administrator account to create a backup of all users’ data.

                        The Back up selected files, drives, or network data option requires
                        someone to specify exactly which files and folders should be backed up.
                        This option should only be used by someone who knows where all data is
                        located.

                        The Only back up the System State data option backs up the Windows
                        Registry, system boot files, and other information that should not be
                        transferred to the new Windows XP Home Edition installation, so this
                        backup option should not be used when rebuilding the computer.

                   Choose the appropriate option and click Next. If the Back up selected files,
                   drives, or network data option was specified, then choose which data should be
                   backed up and click Next when done.

               v. The Backup Type, Destination and Name window appears. Select a place to
                  store the backup, such as a writable CD, and specify a name for the backup.
                  Click the Next button.

              vi. Click the Advanced button to specify backup options.

             vii. Select the Normal backup type, and then click the Next button.

            viii. Choose the Verify data after backup option, and then click the Next button.

              ix. Choose to Replace the existing backups and click Next.

               x. Select Now to perform the backup now.

              xi. Confirm that the settings are correct and click the Finish button to start the
                  backup.

             xii. Once the backup is complete, click the Close button.

         b. Files and Settings Transfer Wizard 58

               i. Click on Start, then All Programs. Choose Accessories, then System Tools.
                  Select the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, then click Next.

              ii. Select Old computer to capture the current settings.


58
     This backup method is generally not preferred because it does not provide a simple way for the user to verify
     the integrity of the backup.

                                   GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


       iii. Choose Other and select a location to store the files and settings to removable
            media, such as a CD-RW. Then click Next.

       iv. Choose to back up Both files and settings, then click on Next.

        v. The wizard backs up the files and settings. Click on Finish when it is done. It
           creates a folder with a large file (all the files and settings bundled together) and a
           very small status file.

   c. Third-Party Backup and Restore Utility

        i. Run the utility and perform the backup based on the utility vendor’s
           documentation.

        ii. Using features provided by the utility, verify the integrity of the backup.

   d. Third-Party Remote Backup Service

        i. Perform the backup using the remote backup service’s software and directions.

        ii. Verify the integrity of the backup using features provided by the remote backup
            service.

   e. File Copy to Media

        i. Select the files to be backed up, and drag them onto the media. Alternately, copy
           the files to be backed up, and paste them onto the media. Perform this as many
           times as needed to back up the files to be preserved.

        ii. Verify the integrity of the backup by accessing a sample of files on the media
            and ensuring that they are undamaged.

3. Perform an antivirus scan on the media to ensure that it does not contain any malware.
   Consult the antivirus software documentation for instructions on how to do this.

4. Safeguard the media. The media should be kept in a proper physical location. The media
   should be protected from environmental threats such as water and excess heat. Also, if
   needed, the media should be protected from unauthorized physical access by locking it
   up.

4.3     Install Windows XP Home Edition

After performing any needed backups, the next step is to install Windows XP Home Edition. 59
This section provides recommendations and step-by-step instructions for doing so, focusing on
the settings that have security implications. Because every computer is different, the exact steps
for installing Windows XP Home Edition may vary from the ones listed in this section. Users
should consult their Windows XP Home Edition documentation, the Microsoft Web site, or
Windows XP Home Edition experts whenever in doubt as to what actions to perform.

Because the computer is unsecured and vulnerable to exploitation through networks during
installation, the computer should be disconnected from all networks before the installation
begins. 60

 If the computer uses broadband (e.g., DSL, cable modem) or is part of a wired home
      network, disconnect from the computer the cable that provides its network access.
 If the computer uses a wireless network, no action is necessary because the process of
      installing Windows XP Home Edition will effectively cause wireless networking to be
      unconfigured. (By default, a new installation of Windows XP Home Edition will not
      automatically join any wireless networks.)
 If the computer uses dial-up (i.e., phone line and modem), no action is necessary because the
      installation process will not try to use the modem.
The first part of the installation process is to load and start the Windows XP Home Edition CD.
This can be done using the following steps:

      1. Place the Windows XP Home Edition CD into the CD-ROM drive.

      2. Restart the computer. A BIOS message might appear that says to press any key to boot
         from the CD. 61 If so, press any key while the message is displayed to start the boot.

      3. Windows Setup should open and load files. When the screen titled Windows XP Home
         Edition Setup appears, press Enter to begin the setup.

      4. The Windows XP Licensing Agreement should be displayed. Review it and press the F8
         key if it is acceptable.

59
      The instructions in this section are based on the assumption that the user has a standard Windows XP Home
      Edition CD, and not a system CD provided by the computer’s manufacturer. More information on system CDs
      is provided in Section 4.1.
60
      The computer should not be connected to any network until the installation has been completed and initial
      security measures have been implemented.
61
      If the computer does not boot from the CD, then the computer might not be configured to boot from CD-ROM
      before other media, such as the hard drive or floppy drive. Consult the computer’s hardware documentation for
      instructions on how to alter its BIOS settings so that the computer will boot from the CD-ROM drive before the
      floppy drive or hard drive. It is also possible that the Windows XP Home Edition setup program does not
      recognize the CD-ROM drive. In that case, it may be necessary to create a set of boot floppy disks. Consult the
      vendor documentation for more information on this.


                                                         4-6
                                            GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


The next part of the process involves wiping out the information already on the computer’s hard
drive. Steps for doing this are as follows:

     1. If a previous Windows XP installation is detected, it will be reported. Press the Esc key
        to install a new copy rather than updating the existing copy.

     2. The next decision is which hard drive partition Windows XP Home Edition should be
        loaded onto. On most computers, this is the C:\ partition. Highlight the correct partition
        and press Enter. If there are multiple old partitions from a single physical drives, these
        can be deleted by pressing D, then a new partition created by pressing C.

     3. If a warning appears that there is already another operating system on the partition,
        confirm that the correct partition has been selected, then press C to continue loading
        Windows XP Home Edition.

     4. The next decision is which file system should be used, File Allocation Table (FAT) or
        NT File System (NTFS). NTFS offers security features that FAT does not, so unless
        there is a specific reason why FAT needs to be used, select the Format the partition
        using the NTFS file system (Quick) option and press Enter. If the hard drive has been
        in use for a while and has a lot of data on it, it might be preferable to select the Format
        the partition using the NTFS file system option (without the “Quick”). This will
        perform a full format, wiping all data from the drive. This could take between several
        minutes to an hour depending on the size of the hard drive. 62

     5. If asked, press F to initiate the formatting. (This question is only displayed if the hard
        drive has existing data on it.)

Once the drive has been formatted, Windows XP Home Edition will be installed onto the
computer. This will typically take between several minutes and a few hours, depending on the
computer’s hardware. The user is next prompted to make certain basic configuration choices, as
follows:

     1. The Regional and Language Options window appears. Make any desired changes and
        click Next when done.

     2. The Personalize Your Software window appears. A name must be entered; the
        organization name is optional. When done, click Next.

     3. The Product Key (a series of letters and numbers in the format XXXXX-XXXXX-
        XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX) must then be entered. It is usually found on or with the
        packaging containing the Windows XP Home Edition CD. After entering, click Next.
        (Note that some vendor-specific versions of Windows XP Home Edition may not require
        a product key to be entered, and will skip this step.)

     4. The What’s your computer’s name? window appears. Type in a generic name for the
        computer that does not use personal information or describe the physical location. Do
        not use the automatically generated name. Click Next when done.

     5. The Modem Dialing Information window appears next if Windows XP Home Edition
        recognizes a modem in the computer. If so, enter the requested dialing information.
        Even if the modem is not going to be used, the area code still needs to be entered so that
        the setup process can continue. After doing so, click Next.

     6. The Date and Time Settings window appears. Set the correct date, time, time zone, and
        daylight saving settings. Once set, click Next.

     7. The Networking Settings window appears. Select Custom settings and click Next.

     8. In the Networking Components window, unselect the check box for QoS Packet
        Scheduler. Also unselect the check box for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft
        Networks unless this computer will be sharing its files or printers with other computers
        on the local network. If the computer will not be using shared folders or printers from
        other computers on the local network, also unselect the check box for Client for
        Microsoft Networks. When done, click on Next.

After the initial configuration is complete, the computer will reboot. If prompted to press a key
to boot from CD, do not press a key. Windows XP Home Edition will be launched. Once the
reboot has been completed, additional configuration settings need to be made, as follows:

     1. Click on Next to start the configuration process.

     2. If the CD included Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, the next screen asks if
        Automatic Updates should be enabled. This setting is configured later in the instructions,
        so at this time choose the Not right now option and click Next.

     3. Choose the option that reflects how the computer will first connect to the Internet:

          Telephone modem. Settings will be entered later in the configuration process.

          Digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem. The next screen that appears asks
             the user whether or not a username and password is needed to connect to the Internet.
             This is different from an e-mail username and password; some DSL and cable modem
             providers supply a separate username and password just to get Internet access. If a
             username and password are required, enter them. 63
          Local area network (LAN). Settings will be entered during the next step.

     4. If Digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem or Local area network (LAN) was
        selected in the previous step, perform the following steps to enter the network settings:

63
     For DSL access, the DSL username and password are usually cached on the DSL router. For cable modem
     access, the cable modem’s MAC address is typically used to authenticate to the cable provider network, so no
     username and password are required.


                                                        4-8

          a. If the ISP or a local device (e.g., firewall appliance) issues an IP address to the
             computer automatically (usually through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
             [DHCP]), check the Obtain IP automatically box. Otherwise, enter the static IP
             address assigned to the computer, along with the corresponding subnet mask and
             default gateway settings.

          b. If the ISP or a local device issues DNS server addresses to the computer
             automatically (usually through DHCP), check the Obtain DNS automatically box.
             Otherwise, enter the IP addresses for the primary and alternate DNS servers. The
             primary DNS server address is required, and the alternate DNS server address is
             optional.

          c. Click Next to continue.

      5. The next screen prompts the user to register Windows XP Home Edition. Because the
         computer is not yet network-connected, registration cannot be performed at this time.
         Select the No, remind me every few days option and click on Next.

      6. The next screen that appears is the Internet access setup screen. Select No, not at this
         time and click Next.

      7. At least one user account must be created during the configuration process. Any
         accounts created at this time will have administrative privileges, so only one account
         should be added now. Once the computer is fully secured, other accounts can be created.
         Enter a username for the computer’s administrative account in the Your name box, then
         click Next.

      8. The installation of Windows XP Home Edition is complete. Click Finish.

Windows XP Home Edition should open with the user account that was just created.64

4.4     Secure the Computer

The next step in the installation process is to secure the computer. The user should do this
immediately, based on the detailed guidance presented in Section 5. The major steps in securing
the computer are as follows:

      1. Perform preparatory actions, such as gathering software media and documentation.

      2. Apply updates to Windows XP Home Edition, and configure it to update itself
         automatically in the future.

      3. Install and configure additional security software, such as antivirus software and a
         personal firewall.

      4. Alter the default Windows XP Home Edition configuration to further improve security.
64
      This account will be assigned a strong password during the execution of the steps described in Section 4.4.


                                                          4-9
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      5. Document the installed software applications for future use in troubleshooting problems.

Once the computer has been secured, the users should configure each user account and the
folders and applications to improve their security, as described in Section 7. This should result
in a reasonably well-secured computer that is ready to be used.

4.5     Restore the Data Files and Configuration Settings

The final step in the Windows XP Home Edition installation process is to restore previously
backed up data files and configuration settings, if needed. 65 When restoring settings from
backups, users should be very careful about overwriting existing settings on the computer. For
example, old application settings may be insecure; restoring them onto the computer could
inadvertently affect the security of the application, which in turn could reduce the security profile
of the computer. Users should also be aware of differences in directory structures; some versions
of Windows have used different directories for holding files. Consequently, it may be necessary
to restore file backups to different directories so that files are in the proper locations.

To restore data files or configuration settings that were backed up using the directions in Section
4.2, perform the following steps:

      1. Retrieve the media that contains the backup.

      2. Transfer the files and settings from the media to the Windows XP Home Edition
         computer using the chosen method:

          a. Backup or Restore Wizard

                i. Go to Start, then All Programs, and choose Accessories. Next, select System
                   Tools, and click on the Backup icon. This should launch the Backup or Restore
                   Wizard.

                ii. Click the Next button. Select Restore files and settings, then click the Next
                    button.

               iii. The What to Restore window appears, asking the user which backup file to
                    restore. Select the backup file to restore and click the Next button.

               iv. Click the Finish button to restore the files that were backed up.

                v. Once the restore is complete, click the Close button.

          b. Files and Settings Transfer Wizard



65
      Data files should not be restored until antivirus software and antispyware software has been installed, updated
      fully, and configured to scan all files, in case the backup media contains any malware or spyware. These
      precautions should have already been performed as part of the Section 4.4 recommendations.


                                                         4-10
                                        GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


              i. Click on Start, then All Programs. Choose Accessories, then System Tools.
                 Select the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, then click Next.

              ii. Select New computer to restore the previously captured files and settings, then
                  click Next.

             iii. Choose the I don’t need the Wizard Disk option, since the backup was already
                  performed, then click Next.

             iv. When prompted for the location of the files and settings, choose Other and
                 select the location of the backup. Then click Next.

              v. The wizard restores the files and settings. When it is done, click Finished. The
                 computer may need to be rebooted before the new settings take effect.

         c. Third-Party Backup and Restore Utility

              i. Run the utility and perform the restore based on the utility vendor’s
                 documentation.

         d. Third-Party Remote Backup Service

              i. Perform the restore using the remote backup service’s software and directions.

         e. File Copy to Media

              i. Select the files on the media to be restored, and drag them onto the appropriate
                 folder on the Windows XP Home Edition computer. Alternately, copy the files
                 to be restored, and paste them into the appropriate folder. Perform this as many
                 times as needed to restore all the preserved files.

4.6     Summary

Instead of upgrading an older version of Windows to Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP
Home Edition should be installed or reinstalled on a computer, which means that all existing
Windows XP Home Edition settings, applications, and data on the computer are destroyed unless
first backed up to removable media or otherwise preserved. The installation process for
Windows XP Home Edition has five phases, as follows:

      1. Prepare for the Installation. This involves basic preparatory actions, such as gathering
         the software media and documentation that may be needed for the installation,
         documenting critical OS and application settings, and acquiring blank media for backups.

      2. Back Up Data and Configuration Files. This is the transfer of user data files and
         configuration settings from the computer to external media, such as CD-ROMs or flash
         drives.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   3. Install Windows XP Home Edition. This is the actual installation of Windows XP
      Home Edition. The computer should be disconnected from all networks before the
      installation begins.

   4. Secure the Computer. This involves performing various actions to secure Windows XP
      Home Edition. It also involves installing and securing applications that will be run on the
      computer.

   5. Restore Data and Configuration Files. This causes the user data and configuration
      settings that were backed up during phase 2 to be transferred back to the computer.

Once this installation process has been completed, each user account on the computer needs to be
secured. Section 7 contains step-by-step directions for accomplishing this.

5.      Securing a New Windows XP Home Edition Installation
Before anyone uses a newly installed Windows XP Home Edition computer, it should be
properly secured to minimize the possibility of a security breach. This section provides guidance
and step-by-step instructions for securing a new installation of Windows XP Home Edition.66
The guidance in this section assumes that the computer has not been attached to any networks
since Windows XP Home Edition was installed. If the computer has been on a network, it could
have already been compromised because Windows XP Home Edition has few security features
enabled by default. This section also assumes that the computer has not yet been used and does
not yet contain any data. For readers who do not have the time or expertise to follow all of the
instructions in these sections, Appendix A contains instructions for the most essential security
protections for Windows XP Home Edition computers.

5.1     Prepare to Secure the Computer

Users need to perform some preparatory actions before beginning to secure a computer. These
actions can be grouped into three categories: gathering needed materials, setting the default view
for Control Panel, and identifying the Windows XP Home Edition service pack currently in use.
These categories are discussed in Sections 5.1.1 through 5.1.3.

5.1.1 Gather Needed Materials

Before securing the computer, gather the software media and documentation that might be
needed, including the following:

 Documentation and support information from the computer’s manufacturer

 Windows XP Home Edition software, including the Windows XP Home Edition CD and
      service pack CDs (if applicable)
 Software from the computer’s manufacturer

 Software for third-party user applications, such as word processors, graphics tools, e-mail
      clients, and Web browsers
 Software for third-party security applications, such as antivirus software, personal firewalls,
      and data encryption utilities
 Serial numbers for third-party applications that may be needed to register them.

If antivirus software and antispyware software is not already present, it should be acquired
before starting to secure the computer. If the existing security software is significantly out of
date (generally, several years old), it should be upgraded to a new version if possible, otherwise
replaced with a new version. For example, outdated antivirus software typically lacks newer
detection capabilities and other features that are needed to detect and stop relatively recent
malware threats.
66
      This section attempts to make no assumptions about the default settings in Windows XP Home Edition, because
      computer vendors may customize various settings in their Windows XP Home Edition installations.


                                                       5-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


5.1.2 Set the Default View for Control Panel

Control Panel has two views: Classic and Category. Classic View lists each Control Panel item
separately, and Category View groups similar items together. The instructions in this guide
assume that Classic View is being used.

   1. Open the Control Panel.

   2. Look at the text in the upper left hand corner of the Control Panel window.

         If it contains a link that says Switch to Category View, no action is needed because
           Classic View is already the default setting.
         If it contains a link that says Switch to Classic View, click on that link to change the
           default view from Category View to Classic View.
         If it does not contain either a Switch to Category View or a Switch to Classic View
           link, no action is needed because the Windows classic folders option is enabled,
           which allows only Classic View to be used.

5.1.3 Identify Service Pack Currently in Use

It is very important to determine which Windows XP Home Edition service pack the computer is
currently running. Certain directions in this section are specific to a particular service pack
version. To identify the running service pack, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Control Panel, double-click the System icon. The System Properties window
      should appear.

   2. Under the General tab, the information displayed for the System should indicate which
      service pack is currently loaded on the computer, such as Service Pack 1 or Service Pack
      2. Figure 5-1 shows an example from a Service Pack 2 computer. If no service pack is
      listed, then the computer does not have a service pack installed.

   3. Click on OK.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



5.2     Update Windows XP Home Edition

The next step in securing Windows XP Home Edition is to apply updates to it. Although some
updates may be available on CD, such as Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, most need
to be downloaded from the Internet. Before the computer is connected to any network to get
updates, a personal firewall needs to be set up on the computer to block malicious activity from
other computers, such as worms. 67 Without a personal firewall enabled and configured to block
unauthorized network activity, a computer connected to the Internet that has not had updates
applied is typically compromised in minutes. 68 This section provides step-by-step instructions
for identifying, acquiring, and applying the updates, as well as guidance on configuring a
personal firewall to protect the computer during the updating process.

Until the computer has been fully updated, applications such as e-mail clients, instant
messaging clients, and word processors should not be used. The only application use
should be that which is required to update the computer or configure the personal firewall.
Web browsers should be used only for updating the computer and not for general Web
surfing or other purposes.

5.2.1 Configure a Personal Firewall

All pre-SP2 versions of Windows XP Home Edition have a built-in personal firewall called
Internet Connection Firewall (ICF). ICF offers the ability to block unauthorized network activity
directed at a Windows XP Home Edition computer, but by default ICF is disabled. Windows XP
Home Edition SP2 replaces ICF with a new built-in personal firewall called Windows Firewall.
By default, Windows Firewall enables itself if a third-party firewall is not already present. Many
new computers contain trial versions of third-party personal firewalls, so new Windows XP
Home Edition computers could have two or more personal firewalls installed. This guide
recommends using the built-in personal firewall and disabling all others, but users could instead
use a third-party personal firewall and disable all others. Follow the appropriate set of directions
below to enable and configure the built-in personal firewall to block all unnecessary activity
during patching.

If the computer is not yet using Service Pack 2 (it is using either Service Pack 1 or no service
pack at all), perform the following steps to ensure that a personal firewall is enabled and
providing adequate protection for the computer:

      1. Log on to the computer using an administrative-level account.



67
      At this point, installing antivirus software is generally not necessary. It is likely that the antivirus software
      media is several months out of date and will not be effective at stopping most malware threats until the
      computer is connected to a network and updated.
68
      If configured properly, a firewall router can also be effective at protecting unpatched computers during the
      update process. However, because firewall routers are third-party hardware devices, it is outside the scope of
      this document to discuss their configurations. Also, computers that are protected by firewall routers should also
      be protected by personal firewalls as an additional layer of defense, particularly against other computers on the
      same local network that may become infected with malware.


                                                          5-4

     2. If any third-party personal firewall programs are installed on the computer, refer to the
        software vendors’ documentation and help files, and follow their directions to disable
        them.

     3. In the Control Panel, double-click the Network Connections icon. The Network
        Connections configuration box should be displayed.

     4. Right-click the connection that needs to be configured with ICF, then click Properties. 69

     5. Select the Advanced tab. Enable ICF by checking the box for Protect my computer
        and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet.

     6. Click on OK to save the firewall configuration.

If the computer is already using SP2, perform the following steps to ensure that Windows
Firewall is enabled and providing adequate protection for the computer:

     1. Log on to the computer using an administrative-level account.

     2. In the Control Panel, double-click on the Security Center icon. The Security Center
        should be displayed.

     3. The firewall status should indicate if a third-party firewall is enabled. If so, refer to the
        software vendors’ documentation and help files, and follow their directions to disable
        them.

     4. Check the firewall status. If it is listed as OFF, perform the following sub-steps:

              a. Click on the Recommendations… button.

              b. Turn the firewall on by clicking the Enable now button. A notification window
                 should appear, saying that the firewall was enabled successfully. Click on Close.

              c. Click on OK to close the Recommendation window. The firewall status should
                 now be listed as ON.

     5. Close the Security Center.

5.2.2 Connect the Computer to the Network

The next step is to connect the computer to a network. Networking options include telephone
modems, broadband (e.g., DSL, cable modem), or a wired or wireless Local Area Network
(LAN). This section provides the steps needed to set up a Windows XP Home Edition computer
to use each of these networking options. If the computer will use multiple forms of networking,
such as a cable modem and wireless, follow each applicable set of directions below.


69
     If a dial-up modem is being used, it may be necessary to first implement the Section 5.2.2 directions for
     configuring a dial-up connection first, and then return to this step.


                                                         5-5
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION




If the computer uses a telephone modem for its access to other networks, follow these steps:

   1. From the Control Panel, double-click on the Network Connections icon.

   2. Click on File, then New Connection to run the New Connection Wizard. When the
      wizard window appears, click Next.

   3. Click on the Connect to the Internet option and click Next.

   4. The user needs to choose from three options: Choose from a list of Internet service
      providers (ISPs), Set up my connection manually, and Use the CD I got from an ISP.
      Select the appropriate option based on the ISP’s instructions or documentation, and click
      Next.

   5. Provide all requested information and follow the prompts based on the ISP’s instructions
      or documentation.

   6. After filling in the ISP-specific information, click on Add a shortcut to this connection
      to my desktop, and then click Finish.

If the computer uses a wired local area network or broadband (e.g., DSL, cable modem) for
its access to other networks, simply connect the network cable to the computer to establish
network connectivity. All necessary configuration settings should have already been entered
during the Section 4.3 instructions for installing Windows XP Home Edition.

If the computer uses a wireless local area network, follow the steps listed below:

   These instructions assume that the wireless connectivity features built into Windows XP
   Home Edition are being used to configure and manage the wireless network card. In
   some cases, it may be desirable to use a separate wireless configuration utility provided
   by the vendor of the wireless network card, or a vendor’s version of Windows XP Home
   Edition may use such a utility by default. If a separate utility is to be used, skip the steps
   below and instead follow the directions from the utility’s vendor on how to configure it to
   establish wireless network connectivity. If you are unsure if a separate utility is being
   used, it should become obvious after attempting a few steps of the directions whether or
   not these steps are correct for your situation.

   1. From the Control Panel, double-click on the Network Connections icon.

   2. Right-click the wireless connection that needs to be configured, then click Properties.
      (If a wireless network connection entry does not exist, the proper driver for the wireless
      network card may not be installed. Follow the wireless card manufacturer’s directions
      for installing the driver.)

   3. A list of wireless networks in range should be displayed (if not, select View Wireless

         Connect button. Note that wireless networks can be “hidden” so that their names do not
         appear in the list. If the network is “hidden”, click the Add button and manually type the
         network’s SSID (wireless network name), then click OK to connect.

     4. If a WEP or WPA key is required by the wireless access point, enter it when requested
        and click on Connect. 70

5.2.3 Activate Windows

Before downloading updates, Windows XP Home must be activated, because Microsoft will not
allow downloading of the latest Service Packs without ensuring that a legitimate copy of
Windows is being used. 71 Activating just ensures that the version of Windows is legitimate and
is not the same as registering, though registration can be accomplished at the same time.

     1. Run Activate Windows. This can be accomplished in any of the following ways:

         -   Begin activation when the Activate Windows window pops up automatically when
             logging in.
         -   Click on Start, then All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools. Select
             Activate Windows.
         -   Click on the Activate Windows icon in the Quick Launch area. The icon looks like a
             set of keys.
     2. Assuming there is a working Internet connection, click on Yes, let’s activate Windows
        over the Internet now. Alternatively, activation can be performed by telephoning
        Microsoft customer support and following their guidance.

     3. Register and click Next. Registration data should then be entered on the next page.

     4. Activation should then complete automatically. If Windows cannot connect to the
        Internet, a connection screen will appear to help connect to the Internet. If activation
        fails, call Microsoft customer support.

5.2.4 Apply Updates

The next step is to identify, download, and install necessary updates for the computer, as
described in Section 3.1.1. If a service pack CD is available, it should be used first before
downloading additional updates. Both Automatic Updates and Microsoft Update can be used to
download some updates. However, although Automatic Updates can acquire and install all
Windows XP Home Edition security-related updates, it does not include all updates, such as
hardware drivers. The Microsoft Update Web site can be used to acquire and install all types of
updates, both security and non-security-related. To use Microsoft Update, perform the steps
below.

70
     Section 5.4.2.2 provides additional information on wireless security, including WEP and WPA keys.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


Because the predecessor to Microsoft Update was named Windows Update, Windows XP Home
Edition computers that are not fully updated may display “Windows Update” instead of
“Microsoft Update” on some screens. 72 This should not be a cause for concern; during the
update process, Windows Update will eventually be replaced with Microsoft Update.

     1. Run Internet Explorer. Click on Tools, then Windows Update, to start Microsoft
        Update. 73

     2. If a prompt appears asking to install and run Windows Update, click Yes.

     3. If a prompt appears saying that a new version of the Windows Update or Microsoft
        Update software is available, click on Install Now or Download and Install Now to
        install the new version. Multiple updates may be needed. If prompted to do so, close
        Internet Explorer or reboot the computer so that the new version of the update software
        takes effect. (If a reboot is needed, restart these instructions at step 1 after the reboot
        completes.)

     4. Click on the Custom button to identify available updates. 74

     5. Microsoft Update checks for updates and lists the available ones. Figure 5-2 shows an
        example of how updates are listed. Depending on the service pack level of the Windows
        XP Home Edition installation CD, either Service Pack 2 or non-service pack updates
        should be displayed. Follow the appropriate step:

         a. Non-service pack updates are grouped by high priority updates, optional software
            updates, and optional hardware updates. 75 Install them using the following steps:

              i. Review the list of available updates, select the desired ones (or accept the default
                 setting), then click Review and install updates. In some cases, one patch may
                 need to be installed by itself; therefore, it may not be possible to install all desired
                 patches at once.

             ii. Confirm that the correct updates are listed, and click the Install Updates button to
                 perform the installations. Review any licensing agreements that are displayed and
                 click on the appropriate button for each.

            iii. The download and installation process will begin. Depending on the number of
                 updates and the network bandwidth available, it may take from a few minutes to a

72
     Windows Update was renamed Microsoft Update in mid-2005. The directions in this section reflect the titles
     assigned to the update Web site and local software components as of August 2005.
73
     Alternatively, Microsoft Update can be started by entering the URL http://update.microsoft.com/ into the
     Internet Explorer address bar.
74
     The Custom option can install both high priority and optional updates, and allows the user to select which
     updates should be installed. The Express option can only install high priority updates, and does not allow the
     user to specify which updates should be installed. Using the Express option may cause the system to download
     and install service packs automatically.
75
     High priority updates are defined as critical updates, hotfixes, service packs, and security rollups. Optional
     updates are unrelated to fixing security problems, but may contain new security features.


                                                        5-8
                                              GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


                  few hours to download and install the updates. When the installations are done,
                  Microsoft Update should report which updates were successfully installed. It will
                  also prompt the user to reboot the computer if any of the updates require a reboot
                  to complete the installation. Click on OK to reboot immediately or Cancel to
                  manually reboot the computer later.

         b. Service Pack 2 can be installed through Microsoft Update using the following
            steps: 76

              i. Click on Download and Install Now.

             ii. Review the license agreement and click on the appropriate button.

            iii. Service Pack 2 should be downloaded and installed. This may take considerable
                 time, depending primarily on the size of the service pack and the type of Internet
                 connectivity and bandwidth available. The Windows XP Service Pack 2 Setup
                 Wizard may prompt the user at some point; click Next to continue.

             iv. Once the installation has ended, a summary should be displayed that reports the
                 installation was successful. Click Restart Now to reboot the computer.

              v. After the reboot, the Help protect your PC screen appears. The Automatic
                 Updates setting is configured later in the instructions, so at this time, choose the
                 Not right now option and click Next.

             vi. The Security Center opens and displays the status of security programs. Since
                 antivirus software and other security programs have not yet been installed on the
                 computer, the current status is irrelevant. Close the Security Center.

     6. Repeat all of these steps until no more updates are available. Depending on which
        service pack was included with the Windows XP Home Edition CD, and the number of
        additional updates that need to be applied, it may take several rounds of updating the
        computer and rebooting it to bring a new Windows XP Home Edition installation
        completely up-to-date.




76
     If a service pack is being installed from a CD instead of through Microsoft Update, the steps to be performed
     will differ.

                                          Figure 5-2. Microsoft Update


During the updating process, the computer may state that additional updates cannot be
downloaded until Windows XP Home Edition has been validated or activated. If so, follow the
instructions provided by Windows XP Home Edition to activate the software through the
Internet, dial-up, or telephone.

It is also important to update other applications on the Windows XP Home Edition computer.
Follow these steps for each application:

     1. Install the application. 77

     2. Review its documentation for guidance on how to update it and how to configure it to
        update itself automatically (if possible).

     3. Implement the vendor’s recommendations. If needed, close and restart the application, or
        reboot the computer, so that the changes take effect.

77
     It is often advantageous to install applications such as e-mail clients and Web browsers before installing
     security software. For example, when antivirus software is installed, it may automatically identify installed
     email clients and configure itself so that it monitors their activity for malware.


                                                         5-10

5.2.5 Configure the Computer for Automatic Updates

To keep Windows XP Home Edition fully updated at all times, it is highly recommended that the
Automatic Updates service built in to Windows XP Home Edition be enabled, as described in
Section 3.1.1. This should keep both Windows XP Home Edition and key Microsoft
applications (e.g., Internet Explorer, Outlook Express) fully updated. To enable and configure
Automatic Updates, perform the following steps:

   1. From Control Panel, double-click Automatic Updates.

   2. Choose the appropriate radio button, as shown in Figure 5-3.

        If the computer has high-speed Internet access, select Automatic (recommended).
          Then select the frequency and timeframe in which the updates should be downloaded
          and installed (e.g., every day at 3:00 A.M.)
        If the computer has low-speed Internet access, select Notify me but don’t
          automatically download or install them. This allows the user to control when
          updates are downloaded.
   3. Click on OK to save the Automatic Updates configuration.




                         Figure 5-3. Automatic Updates Configuration

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



5.3     Install and Configure Additional Security Software

The next task in securing a new Windows XP Home Edition computer is installing and
configuring security software. Section 5.2.1 already described how to enable and configure a
personal firewall to block unauthorized network access to the computer. This section provides
guidance on configuring other types of software, such as antivirus software, Web browser popup
blocking, and content filtering programs, that can be effective at preventing malware infections
and other types of attacks.

5.3.1 Malware Protection

After applying updates to the computer, users should next install malware protection utilities, as
described in Section 3.3.1. Antivirus software is a necessity, and antispyware software is also
recommended if the antivirus software does not include a robust antispyware capability. Install
the antivirus software (and separate antispyware software, if needed) using the documentation
provided with the software. During the software installation process, or immediately afterward,
the software should be configured as follows, using directions provided within the software
documentation:

 Scan critical operating system components such as startup files, memory, system BIOS, and
      boot records
 Perform real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened, or executed

 Monitor common applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, file transfer and file
      sharing programs, and instant messaging software
 Scan all hard drives regularly (at least once a week)

 Attempt to disinfect files, and quarantine infected files that cannot be disinfected

 Automatically download and install updates daily.

After installation, the software should be fully updated. Consult the software documentation or
help files for directions on how to download and install updates. Most antivirus software and
antispyware software have a menu option that causes the software to check for, download, and
install updates immediately. After doing so, it may be necessary to repeat the update process
once or a few times, because some updates might need to be installed before other updates.
Also, it may be necessary to reboot the computer after applying certain updates.

5.3.2 Content Filtering

Users may also want to use content filtering software, such as spam and Web content filtering
software, as described in Section 3.3.3. Some e-mail clients and Web browsers have such
capabilities built-in; they can also be performed by third-party software. Content filtering
programs are helpful in stopping certain types of malware, but are not necessities. If content
filtering is to be performed on the computer, install and configure the software using the
documentation provided. The software should be configured to check for updates frequently and



                                               5-12
                                               GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


either to download and install updates automatically, or to let the user know when updates are
available so that the user can download and install them at a convenient time.

After installation, the software should be fully updated. Consult the software documentation or
help files for directions on how to download and install updates. Most content filtering programs
or software features have a menu option that causes the software to check for, download, and
install updates immediately. After doing so, it may be necessary to repeat the update process one
or a few times, because some updates might need to be installed before other updates. Also, it
may be necessary to reboot the computer after applying certain updates.

5.3.3 Personal Firewall

Section 5.2.1 provides instructions for enabling the Windows Firewall. Because third-party
personal firewall programs may offer additional functionality, users may choose to disable
Windows Firewall and use a third-party firewall instead. Only one personal firewall should be
enabled on the computer at a time. Because a Windows XP Home Edition computer should
always have a personal firewall enabled when it is connected to a network, users who want to
switch firewalls should first enable the second firewall and then immediately disable the first
firewall. 78 Section 3.3.2 provides additional information on personal firewalls.

To disable Windows Firewall, perform the following steps:

     1. In the Control Panel, double-click on Security Center.

     2. In the Security Center, choose to manage security settings for Windows Firewall.

     3. Set the Off option, then click OK.

     4. Close the Security Center.

Users should configure the personal firewall to use the following settings whenever possible:

 Enable the personal firewall to protect every network interface on the computer, including
     wired and wireless networks cards, as well as dial-up access
 Only permit authorized activities; deny all others by default, or prompt the user to manually
     accept or reject each unknown activity 79
 Restrict both incoming and outgoing activity.




78
     An alternative is to disconnect the computer from all networks, then disable the first firewall and enable the
     second firewall. This may be necessary if the second firewall cannot be enabled while the first firewall is still
     enabled.
79
     Prompting the user to make these decisions works best with users that have strong knowledge of software and
     security. Novice users are unlikely to understand the messages presented by the firewall, so they tend to allow
     unknown activity, which defeats the purpose of having the firewall. Accordingly, personal firewalls should be
     set to prompt the user only if it is reasonably certain that users will make the right decisions.


                                                         5-13
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



5.4     Alter the Windows XP Home Edition Configuration

Once computer security programs have been installed and configured, the next step is to alter the
Windows XP Home Edition configuration to further improve security. This section recommends
specific changes to the default Windows XP Home Edition configuration. The step-by-step
instructions in this section build upon the recommendations presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
such as disabling unnecessary functions and services, and creating separate accounts for each
user.

5.4.1 User Accounts and Sessions

To make the changes recommended in Section 3.1.2 related to user accounts and user sessions,
perform the following steps:

      1. From the Control Panel, double-click on User Accounts.

      2. Create strong passwords and safeguard them on password reset disks or paper for all
         administrator accounts. To do so, perform the following steps for each computer
         administrative account:

          a. Select the account.

          b. Click Create a password.

          c. Enter a new password and type it once more to confirm it. Do not enter a password
             hint. Click the Create Password button. 80

          d. By default, the administrative account’s files and folders are available to other users
             of the computer. To make them private, click on the Yes, Make Private button.

          e. If the computer has a floppy drive, perform the following steps:

               i. In the Related Tasks box, click on the Prevent a forgotten password link.

              ii. The Forgotten Password Wizard should start. Click on Next.

             iii. As directed, place a blank, formatted floppy disk into the drive and click Next.

             iv. Enter the current administrative password and click Next.

              v. The wizard creates the disk. When the creation is completed, click Next, then
                 click Finish.

             vi. Store the password reset disk in a physically secure area, because anyone could
                 use it to gain administrative access to the computer.

80
      Recommendations for creating strong passwords are available from the Microsoft article “Selecting Secure
      Passwords”, located at https://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/support/articles/select_sec_passwords.mspx.


                                                       5-14

         f. If the computer does not have a floppy drive, write the password for the
            administrative account on a piece of paper and store it securely, such as in a safe or
            lockbox.

     3. For each person that will be using the computer, create a separate limited user account for
        daily use:

         a. Click Create a new account.

         b. Enter the user name; it can be up to 20 characters long and contain letters, numbers,
            spaces, and some other types of punctuation. When finished, click the Next button.

         c. Set the account type to Limited, then click on the Create Account button.

         d. Have the user choose a strong password and enter it after clicking Create a
            password. Ask the user not to enter a password hint.

     4. Enabling the Fast User Switching feature allows two users to be logged on
        simultaneously without having access to each other’s sessions. 81 To enable the feature,
        perform these steps:

         a. From the Control Panel, click on User Accounts.
         b. Click on Change the way users log on or off.
         c. Check the Use the Welcome screen and Use Fast User Switching options to enable
            the Welcome screen and FUS features.
         d. Click on Apply Options.
     5. Close the User Accounts window.

It is important to ensure that the default Administrator account has a password set. Because this
account can only be accessed from Safe Mode, the computer needs to be rebooted to set the
password. Perform the following steps:

     1. Close all programs. From the Start menu, click Turn Off Computer, then click the
        Restart icon.

     2. When the computer starts to reboot, hit the F8 key to display the Windows Advanced
        Option Menu. Choose Safe Mode and hit the Enter key.

     3. At the next screen, select Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition and hit the Enter key.
        Various text messages should be displayed on the screen, and eventually the Windows
        XP logon screen should appear. 82



81
     This is particularly useful for logging in as an administrator to perform a specific task when already logged in
     with a limited user account.


                                                         5-15
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


     4. Log in as the Administrator user. If asked if the computer should be run in Safe Mode,
        choose Yes.

     5. Perform Steps 1 and 2 from the previous list of steps. These steps will ensure that the
        default Administrator account has a password set and that if the password is forgotten,
        that access can still be gained through the physically secured copy of the password or the
        password reset disk.

     6. Close the User Accounts window and the Control Panel.

     7. From the Start menu, click Turn Off Computer, then click the Restart icon. The
        computer should reboot normally.

5.4.2 Networking

This section contains recommendations for making the following changes related to networking,
as described in Section 3.1.3:

 Disabling unneeded networking features

 Disabling the use of remote access tools

 Configuring wireless networking security

 Disabling or configuring ICS.

5.4.2.1 Disable the use of remote access tools

Windows XP Home Edition’s Remote Assistance feature, as well as all third-party remote access
tools installed on a Windows XP Home Edition computer, should be disabled except when
specifically needed. 83 To disable the use of Remote Assistance, perform the following steps: 84
     1. From the Control Panel, double-click the System icon. The System Properties window
        should appear.

     2. Click the Remote tab.

     3. Uncheck Allow Remote Assistance invitations to be sent from this computer.

     4. Click OK.




82
     The graphics and font sizes are likely to be different; this is a characteristic of Safe Mode only, and the graphics
     and fonts will return to normal when the computer is rebooted regularly.
83
     Third-party tools should also be configured to require a username and password before permitting remote
     access. The username and password should be different from all of the Windows XP Home Edition user
     accounts and passwords.
84
     To temporarily enable Remote Assistance, perform the same steps except for checking the box instead of
     unchecking it.

5.4.2.2 Secure wireless networking

If the computer uses wireless networking, review the documentation provided with the wireless
access point and the computer’s wireless network card, then implement the following
recommendations according to the vendor directions. 85 These directions assume that the
Microsoft wireless management utility is being used, not a third-party utility provided by the
computer’s vendor or the wireless network card’s vendor. If a third-party utility is being used,
do not follow the directions in this section; instead, consult the vendor’s directions for additional
guidance on secure configuration.

     1. Create a long and complex WEP key (also known as a WPA key or WPA passphrase).
        Configure the wireless access point so the WEP key is required. Enter it into the wireless
        access point and the Windows XP Home Edition computer. To do the latter, perform the
        following steps:

         a. From Control Panel, double-click Network Connections.

         b. Right-click on the wireless network connection configuration and select Properties.

         c. Click on the Wireless Networks tab. Highlight the correct wireless network in the
            Preferred Networks list and click the Properties button. Figure 5-4 shows an
            example of the security configuration settings that need to be made.

         d. Set Data encryption to the highest possible setting that both the wireless access point
            and the Windows XP Home Edition wireless network card can use. The encryption
            choices will vary depending on the wireless network card. Recommended choices, in
            order with the most highly preferred option first, are as follows:

                       i. WPA2 with AES

                      ii. WPA1 with AES

                     iii. WPA1 with TKIP

                     iv. WEP with 128-bit encryption.

             Also, configure the access point to use the selected data encryption option, if it does

     The guidance provided in this section is specific to wireless network hardware and software based on the IEEE
     802.11b and 802.11g standards. To secure other types of wireless networks, consult the vendor’s
     documentation and security recommendations. These recommendations also assume that an access point
     (infrastructure mode) is being used instead of a peer-to-peer network (ad hoc mode), because access point-based
     networks are more common than peer-to-peer.

        addresses of all authorized wireless devices into the access point. To identify the MAC
        address for a wireless network card on a Windows XP Home Edition computer, perform
        the following steps:

         a. From Control Panel, double-click Network Connections.

         b. Double-click on the wireless network connection configuration.

         c. Click the Support tab, then the Details… button.

         d. The value listed for the Physical Address is the MAC address. It should be
            displayed in the format XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX, where each X is a digit or a letter
            in the range A to F. Write down the MAC address.

         e. Click Close, then Close. Close the Network Connections window.

5.4.2.3 Configure ICS

If the computer uses dial-up networking to access the Internet, and other computers on the same
home network need to share that Internet access, then it may be necessary to enable ICS.
Otherwise, ICS should be disabled. To configure ICS properly, perform the following steps:

     1. From the Control Panel, select Network Connections.

     2. Right-click on the network connection with Internet access and select Properties.

     3. Click on the Advanced tab.

     4. Perform the appropriate step based on the need for ICS:

          If ICS is not needed, disable it by clearing the check box labeled Allow other
              network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection.

86
     If the computer will be participating in ad hoc wireless networks (such as a peer-to-peer network with another
     computer), select the Any available network (access point preferred) option instead of Access point
     (infrastructure) networks only.


                                                        5-19
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


        If ICS is needed, check the item labeled Allow other network users to connect
           through this computer’s Internet connection. Then, uncheck the item labeled
           Allow other network users to control or disable the shared Internet connection.
   5. Click on OK, then close the Network Connections window.

5.4.3 Files and Folders

This section contains recommendations for making changes related to files and folders, as
described in Section 3.2.2. Specifically, it addresses configuring folder sharing.

The Shared Documents folder is available so that users of a Windows XP Home Edition
computer can share files with each other. In most cases, this is sufficient; however, if there is a
need to create a share that permits read-only access, perform the following steps:

   1. Open My Computer and right-click the folder that should be shared. Click on the
      Sharing and Security… option.

   2. Click on the link labeled If you understand the security risks but want to share files
      without running the wizard, click here.

   3. Select the Just enable file sharing option and click OK.

   4. To share the folder with users on other computers, check the Share this folder on the
      network box and enter a name (or use the default name) for the share in the Share name
      box. Uncheck the Allow network users to change my files box so that users can read
      but not modify the files.

   5. Click OK.

If the Shared Documents folder needs to be made available to users on other computers of the
local network, perform the following steps:

   1. Open My Computer and right-click the Shared Documents folder. Click on the
      Sharing and Security… option.

   2. Check the Share this folder on the network box. Enter a name (or use the default
      name) for the share in the Share name box. If network users should be able to read and
      modify the shared files, check the Allow network users to change my files box,
      otherwise uncheck it.

   3. Click OK.

5.5     Document the Installed Software Applications

A helpful next step in securing the computer is to document the software applications installed
on the computer. Examples of applications include Web browsers, e-mail clients, office
productivity tools (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets), instant messaging software, multimedia
utilities (e.g., audio players), graphics tools, and security software (e.g., antivirus software,
personal firewall). The value of having a list of software is that if problems occur in the future,
the current and previous application listings for the computer can be compared and differences
identified. These differences can be investigated to determine if any of them appear to be
malicious, such as malware and spyware programs that have infected a computer.

To document the installed applications, use the following methods and write down the results:

 From the Control Panel, run the Add or Remove Programs utility. As the example in
      Figure 5-5 illustrates, it shows which software applications are installed on the computer, as
      well as security updates, hardware drivers, and other types of programs.
 Review the folders and icons on the Start Menu and the Desktop to find application shortcuts
      listed there.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


It is also very helpful to document which applications are configured to run automatically when
the computer starts and which applications are currently running on the computer. Again, these
lists can be very helpful in the future in identifying malware and spyware that might infect a
computer. To generate and record these lists, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, then
      System Information. System Information should open.
   2. Select System Summary, which should be in the upper left corner of the window.
   3. Click on File, then Save. This will save the system information to a file. Choose a
      location for the file to be saved and a name for the file. When done, click Save.
   4. Close System Information.
The saved file includes information on the applications that were running at the time the
information was saved and the applications loaded at startup. Within the saved file, this
information is located under Software Environment/Running Tasks and Software
Environment/Startup Programs, as shown in Figures 5-6 and 5-7, respectively. The saved file
can be viewed by running System Information and opening the file from it.

5.6   Summary

A new Windows XP Home Edition computer should be secured properly before it is used or
connected to a network to minimize the possibility of a security breach. As a first step, users
should perform preparatory actions, including gathering needed materials, setting the default
view for Control Panel, and identifying the Windows XP Home Edition service pack currently in
use. The next step is to apply updates to the computer. Before doing this, a personal firewall
needs to be set up on the computer to block malicious activity from other computers. Until the
computer has been fully updated, applications such as e-mail clients should not be used; the only
application use should be that which is required to update the computer or configure the personal
firewall. Microsoft Update provides a convenient way to identify, download, and install updates
for Windows XP Home Edition and selected Microsoft applications. Windows XP Home
Edition computers should also be configured to use the built-in Automatic Updates feature,
which helps to keep the computer up-to-date.

After completing the updating process, the next step in securing a Windows XP Home Edition
computer is installing and configuring additional security software. Antivirus software is a
necessity; antispyware software should also be installed if the antivirus software does not include
a robust antispyware capability. Users may also want to use content filtering software, such as
spam and Web content filtering software, and a third-party personal firewall.

Once security software has been installed and configured, the next step is to alter the Windows
XP Home Edition configuration to further improve security. This includes creating separate
password-protected user accounts for each person, securing networking features, protecting
temporary files, and configuring folder sharing. A helpful next step is to identify the software
applications installed on the computer; such a list of applications can be used in the future to find
malware and spyware by comparing the original list of the applications to the current one and
investigating all differences.

The instructions provided in this section are only part of the process of installing and securing
Windows XP Home Edition. Section 4 describes the complete process. After the instructions in
Section 4 have been completed, each user account still needs to be secured, as described in
Section 7.

6.    Securing an Existing Windows XP Home Edition Installation
Section 5 describes how to secure a computer with a new installation of Windows XP Home
Edition. This section provides similar guidance for computers with previously used installations
of Windows XP Home Edition. It is generally preferable to secure a new installation rather than
a previously used installation. The security state of a previously used installation is often
unknown, so it may take considerable time to determine if the computer has been infected with
malware or attacked successfully in other ways. If the damage to the computer caused by
infections or attacks is serious, it is recommended to reinstall Windows XP Home Edition and
secure the new installation.

Although it is usually preferable to secure a new installation, users may decide in some cases that
it is more convenient to secure an existing installation instead. For example, if a computer has
been running antivirus software and other security controls, and the computer has many
applications installed and large amounts of data stored on the computer’s hard drive, users may
consider it to be unnecessary and overly time-consuming to back up all of the data, reinstall
Windows XP Home Edition and all of the applications, and restore all of the data. In such cases,
users should follow the directions provided in this section to secure their computers. Users
should still be prepared to reinstall Windows XP Home Edition if their computers have been
affected significantly by malware or other attacks.

6.1   Prepare to Secure the System

Users need to perform some preparatory actions before beginning to secure a computer. Section
5.1 describes three categories of actions: gathering needed materials, setting the default view for
Control Panel, and identifying the service pack currently in use. Users should perform all the
actions described in Section 5.1.

6.2   Assess the Computer’s Security

After the preparatory actions have been completed, the user should assess the current state of the
security of the computer. Essentially, the user should attempt to determine if the computer has
adequate security controls in place and if there is evidence of a successful attack, such as a worm
infection or spyware installation. This section describes actions that users can perform to make
such an assessment.

6.2.1 Identify Installed Programs

Users should determine which software applications (and versions of each) are installed on the
computer. These include Web browsers, e-mail clients, office productivity tools (e.g., word
processors, spreadsheets), instant messaging software, multimedia utilities (e.g., audio players),
graphics tools, and security software (e.g., antivirus software, personal firewall). The two
primary ways of identifying the installed applications are as follows:




                                                6-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 From the Control Panel, run the Add or Remove Programs utility. It shows which
     software applications are installed on the computer, as well as security updates, hardware
     drivers, and other types of programs.
 Review the folders and icons on the Start Menu and the Desktop to find application shortcuts
     listed there.
The primary purpose of identifying the applications on the computer is to attempt to remove all
applications that are not desired. Examples include the following:

 Software installed on the computer by unauthorized parties or their automated mechanisms
     (e.g., malware). This software may be malicious.
 Malicious software such as spyware inadvertently installed onto the computer by authorized
     users. 87
 Software that was installed by authorized users or the computer’s vendor but is no longer
     needed. Although such software might not be directly harmful to the computer, current or
     future vulnerabilities in the software could potentially be exploited in attacks, especially if
     the software is not maintained regularly.
Removing needed applications can significantly impair the functionality of the computer.
If users are unsure whether particular applications should be removed, they should review
the documentation for the applications, perform research using data sources on the
Internet, or seek expert guidance so that they understand exactly what functionality the
application provides.

To remove applications, perform the following steps:

     1. From the Control Panel, run the Add or Remove Programs utility.

     2. Select the application that should be removed and click on the Remove or
        Change/Remove button (whichever is available).

     3. Follow the prompts provided by the application’s uninstall program.

     4. If prompted to reboot the computer so that changes will take effect, first close all other
        open programs, and then reboot the computer. If several applications are being
        uninstalled, generally it is acceptable to perform steps 2 and 3 repeatedly, then perform a
        single reboot of the computer.

Another important reason to identify installed applications is to determine if the needed security
software is on the computer. Antivirus software is a necessity; additionally, antispyware
software should be used if the antivirus software does not have robust antispyware capabilities.
The computer should also use a personal firewall (either the Windows Firewall built into
Windows XP Home Edition or a third-party personal firewall). Users should acquire and install


87
     Most malware will not appear in application listings. It will need to be removed using antivirus software.


                                                         6-2
                                              GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


any security software that the computer is lacking. Section 6.2.3 provides additional information
on this.

6.2.2 Identify Running Applications and Startup Programs

Users should determine which applications are currently running on the computer and which
applications are configured to start automatically when Windows XP Home Edition is loaded.
This can be done through the System Information utility. Section 5.5 contains step-by-step
instructions for doing this. Creating a list of applications running on the computer and
applications configured to start automatically can be helpful for troubleshooting future problems.

6.2.3 Check Security Software Configuration

After identifying installed software and removing unneeded programs, the next step is to ensure
that the security software on the computer is enabled and configured correctly. Section 6.2.1
discusses the types of security software and provides guidance on identifying what security
software is installed on the computer.

Periodically, users should review the status and configuration of each security application to
confirm that it is still providing the expected level of protection. 88 To do a status and
configuration review, perform the following steps for each security application, based on the
documentation provided by the software vendors:

     1. Ensure that the application is configured to run automatically at system restart and is
        enabled by default.

     2. Ensure that the application is configured to update itself automatically (if such
        functionality is available) and that the application software, signatures, and other
        components are all up-to-date.

     3. Ensure that the application is configured in accordance with the recommendations
        provided in Section 3.3.

If any significant misconfigurations are found during the review, this indicates an increased
likelihood that the computer has been attacked successfully by malware or other threats. For
example, many instances of malware attempt to disable antivirus software, personal firewalls,
and other security tools. Even a properly secured computer can still be compromised, so users
should not assume that a properly secured computer does not merit attention to its security.
Rather, a poorly secured computer generally requires greater attention than a properly secured
computer in performing a security review, configuring the computer’s security, and addressing
existing security problems, such as malware infections.


88
     As described in Section 3.3, the Security Center provides status and some configuration information for the
     computer’s antivirus software and personal firewall software. The information provided by the Security Center
     might not be sufficient to do the status and configuration review described in this section. In that case, users
     should check the antivirus software or personal firewall configuration settings within the individual application
     itself, and not through the Security Center.


                                                         6-3
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



6.3     Identify and Remove Malware

The next step in securing an existing Windows XP Home Edition computer is to identify and
remove any malware on the computer. 89 Common signs of a malware infection include the
following:

 The computer’s antivirus software, antispyware software, or personal firewall reports
      possible malware activity
 The computer’s antivirus software, antispyware software, or personal firewall is disabled but
      the computer’s users and administrators did not disable it
 The computer does not load Windows XP Home Edition, or error messages are displayed
      while it is loading
 Windows XP Home Edition or applications hang or crash

 Applications start slowly, run slowly, or do not run at all

 The computer’s hardware is being used unexpectedly, such as a hard drive thrashing with
      heavy activity or a network card showing high volumes of communications
 Unknown applications are running on the computer

 The number of e-mails being sent and received suddenly increases

 Unexpected changes occur to the templates for word processing documents, spreadsheets,
      and other common types of files
 The Web browser’s configuration is altered, such as the appearance of a different home page
      or a new toolbar
 User files are deleted, corrupted, or otherwise inaccessible

 Unusual items appear on the screen, such as odd messages, graphics, and overlapping or
      overlaid message boxes
 Unexpected dialog boxes appear, requesting permission to do something

 Personal firewall logs show that the computer has been connecting to unknown computers.

Most of these signs could be caused by something other than malware, such as a faulty
application or a hardware failure. Accordingly, the occurrence of some of these signs should be
a cause for further investigation, but is not a definite indication that there is a malware infection.

6.3.1 Malware Scanning Options

When securing an existing computer, users should perform a full scan of the computer using
antivirus software (and antispyware software, if applicable) to identify and remove any malware
89
      This should be done before applying Windows XP Home Edition updates because certain types of malware can
      interfere with installing updates.


                                                      6-4
                                            GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


on the computer (e.g., quarantine, disinfect, or delete affected files). 90 This can be done using
any of the following:

 Antivirus or antispyware software installed on the computer. In many cases it is possible
     to remove malware using the antivirus or antispyware software already installed on the
     computer. Many antivirus and antispyware vendors also make specialized utilities that can
     detect and eliminate one specific instance of malware, such as a new worm. If it is already
     known which malware has infected a computer, and a specialized removal utility for that
     malware is available, then the utility could be placed onto the computer and run in an attempt
     to remove the malware.
 Antivirus or antispyware software on media (e.g., CD, flash drive, external hard drive).
     An alternative to running antivirus or antispyware software or specialized removal utilities
     from a computer is to run them from separate media. The media can be protected or accessed
     in such a way that it cannot be infected by malware. This can be very helpful when scanning
     for malware because certain types of malware interfere with security software, such as
     modifying or reconfiguring antivirus software so that it does not report infections. In such
     cases, it is much more effective to perform malware scans from protected media.
 Online malware scanning service. Some antivirus and antispyware software vendors offer
     Internet-based malware scanning services. Unlike antivirus or antispyware software installed
     on a computer, which constantly checks the computer for malware, an online malware
     scanner is run only when a user manually activates it, so such services are not a substitute for
     antivirus and antispyware software. However, if the software on the computer has been
     damaged by malware, an online service could be helpful in cleaning the computer.
Users should rely primarily on the antivirus and antispyware software installed on their
computers for finding and removing malware. Using separate media can be more effective, but
it can require considerable expertise and effort to create and maintain the media with all the
necessary up-to-date utilities. Section 6.3.2 provides instructions for using antivirus and
antispyware software on a computer to eradicate malware. If these efforts are unsuccessful,
users should try an online malware scanning service from a major antivirus or antispyware
software vendor. If this does not work, users should ask an expert to examine their computers
and attempt to clean them. Experts can provide assistance on creating, maintaining, and using
separate media to scan computers in such situations.

6.3.2 Removing Malware

On an infected computer, users should try to remove the malware using the computer’s antivirus
and antispyware software. The steps listed below provide general guidance for attempting to
remove malware. 91 Vendors of antivirus and antispyware software often provide detailed
instructions for removing malware, such as specific steps for removing a particular virus or
worm. Once the specific type of malware on a system has been identified, consider checking the
antivirus and antispyware software vendors’ Web sites for more suggestions on how to remove
90
     As described in Section 3.3.1, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is a free utility provided by
     Microsoft that users can run to identify and eliminate certain common instances of malware.
91
     An additional source of general guidance for removing malware is Recovering from a Trojan Horse or Virus by
     Michael Durkota of US-CERT, available at http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/trojan-recovery.pdf.


                                                      6-5
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


it. If the antivirus or antispyware software has specific removal procedures, these should be
followed instead of the general guidance below.

     Before attempting to remove malware, users should perform a backup of their critical
     personal data in case the malware or the malware removal process causes damage to the
     data. Directions on performing backups are provided in Section 4.2. Users should be
     cautious with the backups because they might contain malware-infected files. Once all
     malware has been removed from the computer and the antivirus and antispyware
     programs are fully updated, the backup media should be fully scanned by the antivirus
     and antispyware programs to determine if any of the files are infected.

Follow these steps to attempt to remove malware:

     1. Have the antivirus and antispyware software check for updates to verify that they are
        fully up-to-date. If any updates are available, apply them. 92

     2. Close all of the applications running on the computer except for security tools such as
        antivirus software, antispyware software, and personal firewalls. Applications that
        should definitely be closed include Web browsers, e-mail clients, office productivity
        tools, and instant messaging clients.

     3. Disconnect all of the computer’s network connections. This could include one or more of
        the following:

          Disconnecting a call made by a telephone modem

          Unplugging a network cable from the computer

          Disabling a wireless network card. To do so, perform the following steps:

             a. From the Control Panel, double-click on Network Connections.

             b. Right-click the wireless network card and select Disable.

         check the configuration of the antivirus and antispyware software to ensure that it
         corresponds to the guidance provided in Section 3.3.1.

      If all malware cannot be removed from the computer, seek expert assistance, as
      described in Section 8.5.1. If the malware cannot be removed completely from the
      computer by an expert, or the malware causes serious damage to the computer’s
      operating system, it might be necessary to reinstall Windows XP Home Edition and all
      applications, and restore user data from backups. Continuing to operate a computer that
      is infected with malware could cause other computers to become infected, other files and
      data to become damaged or destroyed, and personal data such as passwords, credit card
      numbers, and PIN numbers to be provided to unauthorized parties.


6.4     Secure the Computer

If the scans described in Section 6.3 indicate that the computer does not have any malware, or
the scans are successful at removing all malware from the computer, the user should continue
securing the computer using the directions presented in Section 5, starting with Section 5.2. The
major steps presented in Section 5 for securing the computer are as follows:

      1. Apply updates to Windows XP Home Edition, and configure it to update itself
         automatically in the future.

      2. Install and configure additional security software, such as antivirus software and a
         personal firewall.

      3. Alter the default Windows XP Home Edition configuration to further improve security.

      4. Document the installed software applications for future use in troubleshooting problems.

If all malware cannot be removed from the computer, the user should seek expert assistance, as
described in Section 8.5.1, or follow the directions in Section 8.5.2 for attempting to recover the
system (e.g., restoring it from a backup, reinstalling Windows XP Home Edition).

6.5     Summary

Although it is usually preferable to secure a new installation of Windows XP Home Edition,
users may decide in some cases that it is more convenient to secure an existing installation
instead. Because the security state of a previously used installation is often unknown, it may
take considerable time to determine if the computer has been infected with malware or attacked

successfully in other ways. If the computer has suffered serious damage, it may be necessary to
reinstall Windows XP Home Edition and secure the new installation instead.

Before beginning to secure an existing installation, a user should perform preparatory actions,
including gathering needed materials, setting the default view for Control Panel, and identifying
the service pack currently in use. The next step is to assess the current state of the security of the
computer; the main focus of this is ensuring that security software is installed and up-to-date, as
well as checking its configuration. The computer should then be scanned for malware, and all
identified malware removed. The security of the computer needs to be maintained on an ongoing
basis, as described in Section 8.

7.      Securing User Accounts and Settings
This section provides recommendations for securing each individual user account on a Windows
XP Home Edition computer. The steps in this section should be performed for every user
account, including each administrative account. Section 7.1 explains necessary changes to user
accounts and files. The rest of Section 7 discusses changes to application configurations that
should improve security. The types of applications covered in this section are e-mail clients,
Web browsers, instant messaging clients, and office productivity suites. Users should also
consider disabling unneeded features and capabilities from other applications whenever possible.

7.1     Secure User Accounts and Files

This section contains the following recommendations for securing user accounts and files on a
Windows XP Home Edition computer:

 Setting a strong password for each user account

 Configuring each user’s folder to be private

 Modifying settings for file associations and extensions.

7.1.1 Set a strong password for each account

The user should log on; no password is required. As soon as logon is complete, the user should
perform the following steps to set a password:

      1. From the Control Panel, double-click on User Accounts.

      2. Click Create a password.

      3. Enter a new password and type it once more to confirm it. Do not enter a password hint.
         Click the Create Password button.

      4. Close the User Accounts window.

7.1.2 Make the user’s folder private

By default, the user’s files and folders are available to other users of the computer, as described
in Section 3.2.2. To change this, the user should perform the following steps:

      1. From the Start menu, double-click on My Computer.

      2. Locate the letter for the drive where Windows XP Home Edition is installed (typically
         C:). Open the \Documents and Settings folder (click Show the contents of this folder
         if necessary). Within it, find the folder that matches the username. The folder should
         contain the user’s My Documents folder, as well as the user’s desktop, cookies, favorites,
         start menu icons, and other user-specific information.



                                                 7-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      3. Right-click on the user’s folder and click on Properties. Click on the Sharing tab.
         Check the box labeled Make this folder private.

      4. Click on OK.

7.1.3 Modify settings for file associations and extensions

Perform the following steps to modify the settings for default file associations and the display of
file extensions, which should help to prevent some successful malware attacks (as described in
Section 3.1.4):

      1. From the Control Panel, select Folder Options.

      2. Select the View tab. In the Advanced settings area, make the following settings:

         a. Uncheck the box for Automatically search for network folders and printers.

         b. Check the box for Display the contents of system folders.

         c. Uncheck the box for Hide extensions for known file types.

      3. Click the Close button.

7.2     Configure E-mail Clients

Make the following changes (described in Section 3.3.6.2) to the configuration of each e-mail
client on a Windows XP Home Edition computer:

 Change the default message reading format to plain text. This can cause pictures, hyperlinks,
      and other content provided through HTML to be omitted or displayed only through
      alternative text. The default message sending format should also be set to plain text as a
      courtesy to other security-conscious users that will be reading the e-mails.
 Disable the automatic download of remote graphics. With this setting in place, most e-mail
      clients will tell the user if an e-mail contains remote graphics and allow the user to choose to
      download them.
 Disable mobile code support. By default, ActiveX and Javascript mobile code support
      should be disabled within e-mail messages.
 Disable the automatic opening of e-mail messages.

Appendix C.4 contains step-by-step instructions for implementing these recommendations for
three e-mail clients: Eudora, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Thunderbird. Users with other e-
mail clients should consult the vendor’s documentation for guidance on altering these settings.

7.3     Configure Web Browsers

Make the following changes (described in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.3) to the configuration of each
Web browser for each user on a Windows XP Home Edition computer:

 Enable popup blocking and configure it to permit trusted Web sites to create popup windows

 Change cookie handling practices so that session cookies and first-party cookies are allowed,
      and third-party cookies are rejected
 Do not store passwords automatically

 Prevent software installation within the browser.

Appendix C.5 contains step-by-step instructions for implementing these recommendations for
three Web browsers: Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Mozilla. Users with other Web
browsers should consult the vendor’s documentation for guidance on altering these settings.

7.4     Configure Instant Messaging Clients

As described in Section 3.3.6.3, users should review the configuration settings for their instant
messaging clients and identify settings that are related to security and privacy. For example,
instant messaging clients typically permit users to suppress the display of their e-mail addresses;
this helps to preserve users’ privacy. Also, requiring each incoming file transfer to be approved
by the user can prevent malicious parties from transferring malware to the computer. Appendix
C.6 contains step-by-step instructions for implementing these recommendations for three instant
messaging clients: AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Windows Messenger, and Yahoo!
Messenger.

7.5     Configure Office Productivity Suites

Users should review the configuration settings for their office productivity suite programs (e.g.,
word processor, spreadsheet, database) and make the following changes to each program, as
described in Section 3.3.6.4, based on the vendor’s documentation that support increased security
and privacy:

 Prompt the user to accept or reject running each macro

 Limit the personal information (e.g., mailing address, phone number) stored in the user
      settings
 Use folders within My Documents or other user-specific areas as the default locations for
      saving documents and holding temporary files (including auto-save and backup copies of
      documents)
 Store custom dictionary entries in a user-specific file in one of the user’s protected folders.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


Appendix C.6 contains step-by-step instructions for implementing these recommendations for
three instant messaging clients: AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Windows Messenger, and
Yahoo! Messenger.

7.6   Summary

Each user account on a Windows XP Home Edition computer, including the administrative
accounts, should be secured. This includes setting a strong password and protecting it,
configuring the personal folder to be private, and modifying default settings for file associations
and extensions. Each user’s e-mail client and Web browser configuration settings also need to
be altered to improve their security. For e-mail clients, this includes reading messages in plain
text, not downloading remote graphics automatically, not opening new messages automatically,
and disabling mobile code support. Web browsers should be configured to block unwanted
popup windows, to not store passwords automatically, to prevent software installation, and to
handle cookies in a way that balances functionality and privacy. Users should also make minor
security-enhancing configuration changes to instant messaging clients and office productivity
suites.

After all user accounts have been secured, the security of the computer and the user accounts
needs to be maintained on an ongoing basis. Section 8 contains advice for doing so.




                                                7-4

8.      Maintaining and Monitoring a Computer’s Security
After a Windows XP Home Edition computer has been secured using the guidance provided in
Section 5 or 6, the computer’s security needs to be maintained on an ongoing basis. This section
provides guidance and step-by-step instructions for maintaining the security of a Windows XP
Home Edition computer. This section assumes that the advice provided in Section 5 or 6 has
already been applied properly to the computer. The administrators and users of a Windows XP
Home Edition computer share the responsibility for maintaining the computer’s security, so this
section provides specific recommendations for each of them.

8.1     Perform Backups and Restore Data As Needed

The administrator of the computer or the individual users should perform backups of their data
and settings on a regular basis. Sections 4.2 and 4.5 describe how to perform backups and
restore information from backups, respectively.

8.2     Perform Administrative Maintenance

Administrators are primarily responsible for maintaining the security of Windows XP Home
Edition computers. Their responsibilities fall into the following categories:

 Ensuring that Windows XP Home Edition and application updates are applied

 Checking the status of security software

 Creating new user accounts

 Deleting old system restores

 Creating new system restore points

 Reviewing shared folders

 Synchronizing the computer’s clock

 Retiring user accounts that are no longer needed.

8.2.1 Apply Updates

As described in Section 3.1.1, administrators should keep the Windows XP Home Edition
operating system and applications up-to-date. This is particularly important for security-related
OS and application patches, as well as updates for security software such as malware prevention
and intrusion detection software, which need to download information on the latest attacks to be
able to recognize them. See Section 5.2 for instructions on configuring Windows XP Home
Edition and applications to update themselves automatically. 93 For applications that do not offer


93
      Even if Automatic Updates is configured to download and install updates automatically, users should also run
      Microsoft Update periodically because it can retrieve lower-priority updates that Automatic Updates cannot.


                                                         8-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


this feature, administrators should check for updates on a regular basis and ensure that they are
installed and configured properly.

Administrators should also consider subscribing to mailing lists that announce the availability of
updates for the software that they use. For example, Microsoft offers a service called Security
Update Alerts, which provides information about new security concerns through e-mail, instant
messaging, and other means. 94 Many vendors send out e-mails as soon as new versions of their
software are available. Subscribing to such lists is particularly important for applications that
lack automatic updating capabilities.

It may also be necessary to acquire, install, and configure completely new versions of security
software occasionally (e.g., every few years), instead of upgrading existing software. This may
be due to a software vendor dropping support for an older version of the software, or additional
beneficial features in a newer version of the software.

8.2.2 Check the Status of Security Software

Administrators should periodically check the status of the computer’s security software to ensure
that it is still enabled, configured properly, and up-to-date. If a computer becomes infected with
malware, the malware may disable or uninstall some of the security software, allowing many
more infections to occur. Accordingly, it is important to check the status of the security
applications frequently. This includes verifying that regular scans performed by antivirus
software and antispyware software (if applicable) find no infections on the computer.
Administrators should also review the alerts and log messages created by security software to
ensure that automatic updates are being performed successfully on a regular basis. For example,
Figure 8-1 shows an example of Security Center reporting that a computer’s antivirus software is
out of date. Section 6.2 contains specific recommendations and directions for checking the status
of security software.

                          Figure 8-1. Security Center Status Reporting




8.2.3 Create New User Accounts

Whenever another person needs to start using the computer, the administrator should create a
new user account, based on the instructions in Section 5.4.1. Also, a person with a new user
account should follow the directions in Section 7 to secure the account.

8.2.4 Delete Old System Restore Points

A system restore point is a snapshot of the configuration of a Windows XP Home Edition
computer. System restore points are typically saved automatically both periodically and when
new software is installed onto the computer. Administrators should delete old system restore
points periodically, perhaps once every three months (more often if free hard drive space is low).
The Disk Cleanup utility built into Windows XP Home Edition can be used to purge several
types of files, including system restore points, from Windows XP Home Edition computers.
Because this eliminates all system restores except the most recent, it should be performed only
when the system is functioning normally and has not been changed significantly recently. To
remove the old system restores, perform the following steps:



                                               8-3
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools. From
      there, choose Disk Cleanup.

   2. It may take a few minutes for the Disk Cleanup utility to load and perform its initial
      space calculations. When the utility completes loading, clear the checkboxes in the Files
      to delete box.

   3. Select the More Options tab. Click on the Clean up… button in the System Restore
      window pane. When asked to confirm that the old restores should be deleted, click the
      Yes button.

   4. Next, click OK in the Disk Cleanup window. Click Yes again to confirm the deletions.

8.2.5 Create New System Restore Points

Administrators may want to create new system restore points manually on occasion, such as
before installing a new application or applying application updates. To create a restore point
manually, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools. From
      there, choose System Restore.

   2. From the introductory screen, choose Create a restore point.

   3. Create a descriptive name for the restore point. When finished, click Create.

8.2.6 Review Shared Folders

Administrators should review the list of shared folders periodically to ensure that all folders
being shared should be. To do so, perform the following steps:

   1. Right-click on My Computer and select Manage.

   2. Under Shared Folders, click on Shares. As Figure 8-2 illustrates, this should show the
      default IPC$ share, which is standard on every Windows XP Home Edition computer, as
      well as all administrator or user-created shares that are intended to be accessed by others.
      If any other shares are shown, the administrator should talk to the user that set up the
      share to determine if others should be able to access it.

8.2.7 Synchronize the Computer’s Clock

Administrators should periodically check to make sure that the computer’s clock is reasonably
accurate. This is beneficial for general computer use, such as having the correct timestamp in e-
mails that are sent, but it also has security benefits. For example, if an expert is reviewing a
computer’s logs to investigate a security problem, having accurate timestamps in the logs can
help the expert to correlate log entries with actions performed by the computer’s user.
Administrators can manually adjust the clock by performing the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select Control Panel, then double-click on the Date and Time
      icon.

   2. Adjust the date, time, and time zone settings as needed.

   3. Click on OK when completed.

Administrators can also configure Windows XP Home Edition computers to synchronize their
clocks automatically with an authoritative external time server. These time servers are extremely
accurate and can be used for free. Administrators can perform the following steps to set up
automated synchronization:

   1. From the Start menu, select Control Panel, then double-click on the Date and Time
      icon.

   2. Click on the Internet Time tab.

   3. Check the box labeled Automatically synchronize with an Internet time server.
      Choose either time.windows.com or time.nist.gov.

   4. To test the configuration, click the Update Now button. It might take a minute for the
      synchronization to occur; status messages should be displayed during the update. If it
      completes successfully, a success message should be displayed.

   5. Click on OK when completed.

If automated synchronization is enabled, administrators should check its status periodically to
ensure that it is working properly. To do so, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select Control Panel, then double-click on the Date and Time
      icon.

   2. Click on the Internet Time tab.

   3. Review the status message in the middle of the window. It should say that the time has
      been successfully synchronized within the past few weeks. If not, click the Update Now
      button to trigger another synchronization attempt.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      4. Click on OK when completed.

8.2.8 Retire Unneeded User Accounts

When a person no longer needs to be using a computer, the administrator should retire that
person’s user account. If the user who no longer needs access is an administrator of the
computer, then a new administrative account should be created for the person who will become
the new administrator, and the previous administrator’s user and administrative accounts both
deleted. A new administrative account can be set up using the instructions in Section 5.4.1; the
only difference is that the account should be set up as a computer administrative account instead
of a limited user account.

To delete a user or administrative account that is no longer needed, perform the following steps:

      1. From the Control Panel, double-click on User Accounts.

      2. Select the account to be deleted.

      3. Choose the Delete the account option. Windows XP Home Edition prompts the person
         performing the deletion to save the user’s files. To save them, choose the Keep Files
         option, otherwise choose the Delete Files option.

      4. Click Delete Account to delete the user account.

      5. Close User Accounts.

8.3     Perform User Maintenance

Each user of a Windows XP Home Edition computer, including administrative account users,
should perform security-related maintenance duties periodically. These responsibilities fall into
the following categories:

 Changing Windows XP Home Edition passwords regularly

 Deleting unneeded files

 Clearing information from Web browsers.

Users should also monitor the Security Center on an ongoing basis. If Security Center
determines that the computer’s antivirus software or personal firewall is disabled or uninstalled,
it should notify the user at login and display a red icon in the taskbar to alert the user of the issue.
This is helpful in identifying major problems with the antivirus software or personal firewall on a
daily basis. The user should then contact the computer’s administrator as soon as possible so
that the problem can be corrected.

8.3.1 Change Windows XP Home Edition Password Regularly

If passwords are being used on a Windows XP Home Edition computer, users should change
their Windows XP Home Edition passwords regularly—at least once every three months—as
well as changing them immediately if it is suspected or known that an unauthorized person has
learned them. Section 3.1.2.2 describes recommendations for password strength. To change a
Windows XP Home Edition password, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Control Panel, double-click on User Accounts.

   2. Choose the Change my password option.

   3. Enter the old password, then enter a new password and type it once more to confirm it.
      Do not enter a password hint. When done, click the Change Password button.

8.3.2 Delete Unneeded Files

Users who are particularly concerned about the privacy of their information should delete
unneeded files periodically. The Disk Cleanup utility built into Windows XP Home Edition can
delete files stored in several places, including Web browser caches (also called Temporary
Internet Files), the Recycle Bin, and temporary files. To do so, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools. From
      there, choose Disk Cleanup.

   2. It may take a few minutes for the Disk Cleanup utility to load and perform its initial
      space calculations. When the utility completes loading, review the descriptions and
      recommendations for each item in the Files to delete box. Select the appropriate
      checkboxes or accept the default suggestions.

   3. When done, click OK, then confirm with Yes. It may take a while to delete the files,
      depending on the volume of files to delete and the hardware capabilities of the computer.

8.3.3 Clear Web Browser Information

Users may also wish to clear the Web browser history and delete cookies periodically as
additional measures in protecting their privacy. To do so for Internet Explorer 6.0, perform the
following steps:

   1. Run Internet Explorer.

   2. From the Tools menu, select Internet Options.

   3. To clear the history, click on the Clear History button and then choose Yes to confirm
      the deletion.

   4. To delete cookies, click on the Delete Cookies button and then choose OK to confirm the
      deletion.

      5. Close Internet Explorer.

8.4     Identify Security Issues

Administrators should use security assessment tools periodically to identify security issues on
Windows XP Home Edition computers. Many utilities are available to identify security issues
on a local computer. The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is a free security
assessment utility that is particularly helpful for Windows XP Home Edition security. For
Windows XP Home Edition and some common Microsoft applications (e.g., Internet Explorer,
Office), MBSA can identify which updates are missing and certain other security issues, such as
insecure configurations and settings. MBSA identifies the problems and also provides
recommendations for fixing each problem. For example, a user can click on a Download icon to
retrieve an update. MBSA must be run from an administrative account.

      Administrators may need considerable expertise in computer security and Windows XP
      Home Edition to understand all of the security issues and recommendations in MBSA
      reports. Administrators without this expertise should use MBSA in conjunction with an
      expert that can provide guidance on the MBSA reports.

To acquire MBSA, perform the following steps:

      1. From Internet Explorer, go to the MBSA Web site, which is located at
         http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx.

      2. Click on the hyperlink for the newest version of MBSA.

      3. Scroll down the page and choose to download the English version of MBSA. If
         Windows validation is required, follow the prompts to allow validation to occur.

      4. Scroll down the download page to the Files in This Download section. Choose the
         English version of the file, MBSASetup-EN.msi.

      5. When prompted to open or save the file, choose Save, specify a location for the file, and
         click on Save.

      6. Close Internet Explorer.

To install MBSA, perform the following steps:

      1. Double-click on the MBSASetup-EN.msi file. The MBSA Setup window should open.

      2. Close all other open programs on the computer, such as Web browsers and e-mail clients.

      3. Click the Next button. Review the license agreement, change the license agreement
         setting as needed, and click on the Next button.

     4. Choose a location for the MBSA installation or accept the default setting, and click on the
        Next button.

     5. Click on the Install button to initiate the actual MBSA installation. The installation
        should take a matter of seconds. When it is done, a successful completion notice should
        be displayed. Click OK to close it.

To use MBSA, perform the following steps: 95

     1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer
        2.0.

     2. Choose to Scan a computer.

     3. By default, the computer’s name should be listed as the computer to scan. The other
        default options should also be acceptable. To begin the scan, click on Start scan.

     4. The scan typically takes a few minutes to run. When it is finished, MBSA displays a
        report that includes scores for various aspects of Windows XP Home Edition security.
        Figure 8-3 shows part of an example report. Red X’s indicate serious security issues, and
        yellow X’s indicate minor security issues.

     5. After reviewing each item on the report, close MBSA.




95
     These directions are based on MBSA version 2.0. These directions may vary significantly for other versions of
     MBSA.

8.5   Investigate Unusual Behavior

If a computer begins to display unusual behavior, users and administrators should act quickly to
investigate it. Generally, the best first step is to reboot the computer. Many functional errors are
cleared through a reboot, and some forms of malware that are memory-resident are flushed from
the computer by a reboot. If a problem persists, the next recommended step is to update the
computer’s antivirus software and antispyware software (if applicable) and perform a full scan of
the computer. If no malware is detected, then additional troubleshooting steps need to be
performed. Examples include the following:


                                               8-10
                                              GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Checking antivirus vendor Web sites for instances of malware that cause the unusual
     behavior being seen
 Reinstalling an application that is not functioning properly

 Searching the Microsoft knowledge base Web site for information on similar problems

 Using utilities that can provide insights as to what is happening on the system.

If the problem still cannot be resolved, seek expert assistance. Section 8.5.1 contains additional
information on this. Section 8.5.2 provides additional information on attempting to recover from
a failure or security compromise.

One of the most common security problems that users and administrators face is false alarms.
Hoaxes involving the security of home computers, such as descriptions of powerful new viruses,
often spread via e-mail throughout the Internet. Some of these hoaxes are malicious in nature,
and implementing their directions could cause a computer to be damaged or have its security
reduced, not improved. Recipients of e-mails warning of new security threats should confirm
their authenticity with an authoritative source, such as antivirus vendors, the vendor of the
software that is supposed to be vulnerable, or reputable security Web sites. 96

Besides hoax e-mails, users often receive e-mail messages that appear to have been originally
sent from the users’ e-mail accounts and rejected by a remote e-mail server. These e-mails
appear to have contained malware which was removed or rejected by the remote server. In most
cases, these e-mails are deceptive; the sender e-mail was chosen at random or taken from
someone else’s address book, and does not reliably indicate who really sent the e-mail. Users
who are concerned about the legitimacy of these e-mails should perform an antivirus scan of
their computers and assume that if the scan does not identify any malware, that the e-mails are
probably forged and that their computers are not infected.

8.5.1 Seek Expert Assistance

In some cases, a Windows XP Home Edition computer may have a technical problem that is
difficult to solve. For example, malware can damage Windows XP Home Edition and
applications such as Web browsers, causing a currently or previously infected computer to
operate strangely. Hardware problems are another common source of challenging technical
problems. Sometimes the configuration for a part of Windows XP Home Edition or an
application is incorrect, and it may not be easy for a user to determine what is wrong or how it
can be fixed.

When difficult problems occur, users should seek the assistance of people with strong expertise
in Windows XP Home Edition or Windows XP in general. Section 8.5.1.1 describes how to use
the Remote Assistance feature built into Windows XP Home Edition. Users can also assist
experts with troubleshooting by collecting and documenting information regarding the problems.


96
     Resources that can be helpful for determining the legitimacy of virus alerts include the Computer Incident
     Advisory Capability (CIAC) (http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/) and the Computer Virus Myths site
     (http://www.vmyths.com/).


                                                        8-11
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


The rest of this section provides examples of information that may be helpful to capture and
recommendations on how to capture it.

8.5.1.1 Remote Assistance

The Remote Assistance feature built into Windows XP Home Edition can be very helpful in
troubleshooting problems. However, it is not always available for use. If a computer cannot get
network access, then it cannot be contacted by a remote computer. Also, if the computer is
separated from the Internet by a device such as a firewall router that performs network address
translation, it is probably not possible for an external expert to initiate a Remote Assistance
session to the computer.

To use Remote Assistance, perform the following steps:

   1. Ensure that the Remote Assistance feature is enabled. Section 5.4.2.1 explains how to do
      this.

   2. Initiate a request for remote assistance. (This can be performed through instant
      messaging or e-mail; these instructions assume that e-mail is being used.)

       a. From the Start menu, click on Help and Support.

       b. Choose to Invite a friend to connect to your computer with Remote Assistance.

       c. Choose the Invite someone to help you option. Enter the e-mail address of the
          person whose assistance is desired, and click Continue.

       d. Fill in the requested invitation information, such as name and a description of the
          problem. When done, click Continue.

       e. Set a timeframe for the invitation. Check the Set a password option, and specify a
          hard-to-guess password. This password should not be an existing password for the
          Windows XP Home Edition computer or the user (e.g., an e-mail account or Web site
          password). Click Send Invitation to send the invitation e-mail to the expert.

       f. Contact the expert, preferably by phone, to provide the password corresponding to the
          invitation.

   3. Wait for the expert to take control of the computer remotely. When the expert attempts
      to connect, a message box is displayed on the computer, asking if the expert should be
      allowed to connect. Click Yes to permit the connection.

   4. During the session, the expert and user can communicate through a chat feature built in to
      the Remote Assistance software. This can be helpful in troubleshooting the problem and
      gathering additional information.

   5. When the expert has completed the session, Remote Assistance displays a message to the
      user, stating that the expert has disconnected from the computer.

8.5.1.2 Error Messages

If an error message is displayed, it should be preserved. The following are the most common
ways of doing so:

 Write down the error message verbatim on paper. This is the simplest method for
     capturing the information, and is most effective for simple error messages.
 Copy and paste the error message. In some cases, a user can copy the text. It can then be
     pasted into an e-mail and sent to an expert, or pasted into a text file and saved for future use.
 Perform a screen capture. For a complex error message, particularly one that cannot have
     its text copied or that includes helpful graphics, it may be best to perform a screen capture.
     To do so, perform the following steps:
     1. Arrange the windows on the computer so that the error message is displayed completely.
     2. Hold the Shift key down. Press and release the Print Screen or PrtSc key. Release the
        Shift key.
     3. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then Paint. Microsoft
        Paint should open.
     4. Click on Edit, then Paste. A copy of the screen should appear in the Paint window.
     5. Click on File, then Save. Choose a location for the picture of the screen to be saved, and
        give the picture file a name. In the Save as type box, select JPEG. When done, click on
        Save.
     6. Close Paint.
8.5.1.3 System Configuration

Windows XP Home Edition provides a utility known as System Information. 97 This utility
collects a wealth of helpful information, including the following:

 Hardware information (e.g., memory, processor, drives, external peripherals)

 Network configuration for all network interfaces

 Software configuration, including hardware drivers, print jobs, network connections, running
     processes, service configurations, and programs loaded at startup
 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Office applications configuration

To use System Information, perform the following steps:

     1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, then
        System Information. System Information should open.

97

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   2. Select System Summary, which should be in the upper left corner of the window.
   3. Click on File, then Save. This will save the system information to a file. Choose a
      location for the file to be saved and a name for the file. When done, click Save.
   4. Provide the saved file to an expert for review. For example, the file could be e-mailed to
      someone; placed onto a CD, flash drive, or other removable media; or reviewed at the
      computer by an expert at a later time. The expert can review the file by running System
      Information and opening the file from it.
   5. Close System Information.
8.5.1.4 System History

In addition to recording information on a computer’s current configuration, the System
Information utility described in Section 8.5.1.3 can also provide information on the computer’s
history. Figure 8-4 shows an example of recent software changes made to a computer. To
capture system history information for someone else to review, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, then
      System Information. System Information should open.
   2. From the View menu, select System History.
   3. Highlight the System Summary text in the upper left corner.
   4. In the View Changes Since dropdown box, select a date that is earlier than when the
      problem is believed to have started. If unsure, select a date at least a few months in the
      past (if available).
   5. Click on File, then Save. This will save the system information to a file. Choose a
      location for the file to be saved and a name for the file. When done, click Save.
   6. Provide the saved file to an expert for review. For example, the file could be e-mailed to
      someone; placed onto a CD, flash drive, or other removable media; or reviewed at the
      computer by an expert at a later time. The expert can review the file by running System
      Information and opening the file from it.
   7. Close System Information.

8.5.1.5 Event Logs

The event logs on a Windows XP Home Edition computer contain records related to various
successful and failed actions, such as logging into the computer and restarting a computer. This
information may be helpful in determining when a malicious event happened. Figure 8-5 shows
an example of event log data. To capture event logs for someone else to review, perform the
following steps:

   1. Right-click on My Computer, then select Manage.
   2. Under System Tools, highlight the Event Viewer item.
   3. For each of the three log types (Application, Security, and System), perform the
      following steps:

8.5.1.6 File Signature Verification Utility

The System Information utility described in Section 8.5.1.3 includes several diagnostic tools,
including the File Signature Verification Utility. This utility checks Windows XP Home Edition
operating system files to ensure that they have been digitally signed by Microsoft. Files that fail
this match could have been added by a benign third party, such as a hardware vendor, or by
malware or other attacks. To check the Windows XP Home Edition files, perform the following
steps:

   1. From the Start menu, select All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools, then
      System Information. System Information should open.
   2. Under Tools, run the File Signature Verification Utility.
   3. Click Start to begin the file scan. It typically takes at least a few minutes for the scan to
      run. When the scan has completed, click Close.
   4. Click the Advanced button, then the Logging tab.
   5. Click the View Log to display the log for the scan. The items with a status of Not

                                       GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   8. Close System Information.
   9. Provide the saved log file to an expert for review. For example, the file could be e-
      mailed to someone; placed onto a CD, flash drive, or other removable media; or reviewed
      at the computer by an expert at a later time. The expert can review the file by opening it
      in Notepad or another text editor.
8.5.1.7 Blue Screen Information

If a serious error occurs on a Windows XP Home Edition computer, the result may be a blue
screen that contains rather cryptic diagnostic information. When this blue screen occurs, a user
can best capture the error message by writing it down. Generally, it is sufficient to copy only the
first few lines. If the computer reboots itself before the entire message can be documented, it
may be necessary to reconfigure Windows XP Home Edition so that it does not reboot
automatically after failure. To do so, perform the following steps:

   1. From the Control Panel, select System.
   2. Select the Advanced tab, then click on the Settings button within the Startup and
      Recovery window pane.
   3. In the System Failure window pane, clear the option to Automatically restart the
      computer upon failure.
   4. Click OK, then OK.

8.5.2 Recover from a Failure or Compromise

Recovering the proper functionality of a Windows XP Home Edition computer from a failure,
such as a crash, or a security compromise can be challenging. For example, it may be nearly
impossible to remove certain types of malware (particularly spyware) from a computer without
causing major damage to the computer. This section describes options for attempting to recover
a Windows XP Home Edition computer. Users who are unfamiliar with these tools should
consult with a Windows XP Home Edition expert before using these tools to modify their
computers.

8.5.2.1 Boot Options

When problems have occurred, it is often helpful to boot Windows XP Home Edition using a
mode other than the default. As Windows XP Home Edition first begins to boot, it briefly
displays a message about hitting the F8 key. If the user does so, the Advanced Options menu is
displayed, which lists several boot options; this is shown in Figure 8-6. One option is to boot in
Safe Mode, which causes Windows XP Home Edition to be loaded with the necessary
components only. In Safe Mode, networking is disabled, as are many other functions. Safe
Mode is most helpful for troubleshooting hardware and hardware driver problems, but it can also
be used to confirm that the core Windows XP Home Edition installation is functioning properly
and that a failure is being caused by an application, service, or other software component such as
malware above the core Windows XP Home Edition files.



                                               8-17
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION




                          Figure 8-6. Windows Advanced Options Menu


Another boot option that is helpful for recovery is called Last Known Good Configuration. This
causes the Windows Registry, which stores configuration information for Windows XP Home
Edition, applications, and users, to be restored to the copy used at the beginning of the previous
boot. If the event that is causing problems occurred since the last reboot, then using the Last
Known Good Configuration option could cause some of the damage inflicted by the event to be
undone. However, it will also cause other configuration changes made to the computer since the
last reboot to be undone.

8.5.2.2 System Restore

Windows XP Home Edition computers save their state periodically in a format known as a
restore point. Administrators can also save restore points manually as desired. The System
Restore utility built into Windows XP Home Edition can be used to restore the state of the
computer to the state captured in a restore point. The goal is to select a restore point from a date
that is before the problem began, but as late as possible so that previous application changes,
computer updates, and other changes to the system are not lost.

To restore the computer to an earlier state, perform the following steps:




                                                8-18
                                        GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      1. From the Start menu, choose All Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools.
         From there, choose System Restore.
      2. Click on Restore my computer to an earlier time, and then click Next.
      3. Select a restore point date. After choosing a date, click Next.
      4. Verify that the desired restore point has been chosen. Click Next to proceed.
      5. The changes to the computer since the restore point will be reversed. When completed,
         the computer will shut down and restart.
8.5.2.3 Recovery Console

The Recovery Console is considered a last-resort option when other recovery methods have
failed. It also requires expert-level knowledge of Windows XP Home Edition. To use the
Recovery Console, perform the following steps:

      1. Insert the Windows XP Home Installation CD into the CD drive, and reboot the
         computer.
      2. When the setup screen appears, choose R to start the Recovery Console and the repair
         process.
      3. Enter the administrative password.
      4. Type in the necessary commands at the prompt. To display a list of available commands,
         type help.
      5. When finished, type exit to close the Recovery Console. Remove the CD from the
         computer and reboot.
8.5.2.4 Windows XP Home Edition Reinstallation

When all else fails, Windows XP Home Edition may need to be reinstalled, and all data restored
from backups. Section 4 describes how to do this.

8.6     Prepare a Computer for Retirement

When a Windows XP Home Edition computer is not going to be used any more, it should be
prepared for retirement. The computer’s hard drive most likely contains information that users
might not want others to see. For example, the computer might have files from tax return
software. Even if the user deletes all of the tax return-related files and software from the
computer, curious people who get access to the computer might be able to recover the tax
information using free or inexpensive software utilities specifically designed to recover deleted
files. Accordingly, users should ensure that all data on the computer’s hard drive is wiped out
before donating, selling, or discarding a computer. Methods of doing this include the following:




                                                 8-19
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


 Use a third-party disk scrubbing utility. There are several commercial software products
      available that are specially designed to remove traces of data from computers. Follow the
      vendor directions on removing data from the hard drive.
 Retain the hard drive. Following the instructions in the computer vendor’s documentation,
      a user can remove the hard drive from the computer. If other people want to use the
      computer in the future, they can purchase a new hard drive and install Windows XP Home
      Edition or another operating system onto the computer. This is the best option if the
      computer is no longer functioning properly, preventing the use of disk scrubbing utilities.
 Destroy the hard drive. Hard drives can be degaussed, which involves applying a magnetic
      field to the drive that makes it unusable. Hard drives can also be shredded or otherwise
      physically destroyed through specialized equipment and services.

8.7     Summary

After a Windows XP Home Edition computer has been secured using the guidance provided in
previous sections, the computer’s security needs to be maintained on an ongoing basis. This
includes the following:

 The administrator or individual users should perform backups of their data and settings on a
      regular basis.
 The administrator should perform regular security maintenance. This includes ensuring that
      Windows XP Home Edition and application updates are applied, checking the status of
      security software, creating new user accounts, and retiring accounts that are no longer
      needed.
 Each user, including administrative account users, should perform regular security
      maintenance for their own accounts and data. This includes changing their passwords
      regularly, deleting unneeded files, and clearing information from Web browsers. Users
      should also monitor the Security Center on an ongoing basis.
 Administrators should use security assessment tools periodically to identify security issues
      on Windows XP Home Edition computers.
If a computer begins to display unusual behavior, users and administrators should act quickly to
investigate it. Generally, the best first step is to reboot the computer, which can clear many
functional errors as well as some forms of malware that are memory-resident. If a problem
persists, the next recommended step is to update the computer’s security tools and scan the
computer for malware. If no malware is detected, then additional troubleshooting steps need to
be performed, such as reinstalling malfunctioning applications, checking antivirus vendor Web
sites for information on malware that might be causing the problems, and checking the Microsoft
Web site for information on similar problems.

If malware cannot be removed from a computer or other technical problems occur that cannot be
resolved, users may need to seek expert assistance. Users should use the Remote Assistance
feature built into Windows XP Home Edition or third-party remote access utilities when needed
to allow a trusted friend, family member, or coworker to assist in troubleshooting such problems.

Users should also collect information as needed to help others in performing troubleshooting.
Users can also use recovery tools under the guidance of an expert to attempt to recover from
major failures or compromises. If all else fails, the user may need to reinstall Windows XP
Home Edition and restore all data from previous backups.

Appendix A—Essential Security Settings
Appendix A contains step-by-step instructions for implementing the most essential
recommendations for securing Windows XP Home Edition computers. Implementing the
instructions in Sections 5 through 8 provides stronger security than implementing just the
instructions in this section. However, there are instances where all of the Section 5 through 8
instructions cannot be followed because of a lack of time or expertise. In these cases, using only
the instructions in this section should provide the most essential security protection for a
Windows XP Home Edition computer.

Figure A-1 displays a flowchart of the high-level steps for implementing the most essential
security recommendations.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION




                                    Step 1: Set the
                                    default view for
                                    Control Panel



                                    Step 2: Ensure a
                                    personal firewall is
                                    enabled



                                    Step 3: Apply
                                    updates




                                    Step 4: Configure
                                    the computer for
                                    Automatic
                                    Updates


                                    Step 5: Install and
                                    configure antivirus
                                    and antispyware

Step 1: Set the Default View for Control Panel

Control Panel has two views: Classic and Category. Classic View lists each Control Panel item
separately, and Category View groups similar items together. The instructions in this section
assume that Classic View is being used.

   1. Log on to the computer using an administrative-level account.

   2. Open the Control Panel.

   3. Look at the text in the upper left hand corner of the Control Panel window.

         If it contains a link that says Switch to Category View, no action is needed because
            Classic View is already the default setting.
         If it contains a link that says Switch to Classic View, click on that link to change the
            default view from Category View to Classic View.
         If it does not contain either a Switch to Category View or a Switch to Classic View
            link, no action is needed because the Windows classic folders option is enabled,
            which allows only Classic View to be used.

Step 2: Ensure a Personal Firewall Is Enabled

Every Windows XP Home Edition computer should have a personal firewall enabled. Windows
XP Home Edition has a built-in firewall; it is called the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF)
before SP2, and the Windows Firewall on SP2 computers. Because third-party personal firewall
programs may offer functionality that the built-in firewall does not, users may choose to use a
third-party firewall instead. Only one personal firewall should be enabled on the computer at a
time.

Perform the following steps to ensure that a personal firewall is enabled and providing adequate
protection for the computer:

   1. In the Control Panel, look for a Security Center icon.

       a. If the icon is present, follow the SP2 instructions below.

       b. If the icon is not present, follow the Pre-SP2 instructions below.

For SP2 computers (ones with a Security Center icon), perform the following steps:

   1. Double-click the Security Center icon. The Security Center should be displayed.

   2. The firewall status should indicate if a third-party firewall is enabled. If it is, refer to the
      software vendor’s documentation and help files to ensure that the third-party firewall is
      configured properly. Close the Security Center and skip the rest of these firewall
      instructions.


                                                 A-3
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


   3. If the firewall status is listed as ON, the built-in firewall is already enabled. Close the
      Security Center and skip the rest of these firewall instructions.

   4. If the firewall status is listed as OFF, perform the following steps:

       a. Click on the Recommendations… button.

       b. Turn the firewall on by clicking the Enable now button.

       c. A notification window should appear, saying that the firewall was enabled
          successfully. Click on Close.

       d. Click on OK to close the Recommendation window. The firewall status should now
          be listed as ON.

       e. Close the Security Center.

For pre-SP2 computers (ones without a Security Center icon), perform the following steps:

   1. In the Control Panel, double-click the Network Connections icon. The Network
      Connections configuration box should be displayed.

   2. Right-click the network connection that is used to get Internet access, then click
      Properties.

   3. Select the Advanced tab. Enable ICF by checking the box for Protect my computer
      and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet.

   4. Click on OK to save the firewall configuration.

Step 3: Apply Updates

The next step is to identify, download, and install necessary updates for the computer.

      1. Run Internet Explorer. Click on Tools, then Windows Update, to start Microsoft
         Update. 98

      2. If a prompt appears asking to install and run Windows Update, click Yes.

      3. If a prompt appears saying that a new version of the Windows Update or Microsoft
         Update software is available, click on Install Now or Download and Install Now to
         install the new version. Multiple updates may be needed. If prompted to do so, close
         Internet Explorer or reboot the computer so that the new version of the update software
         takes effect. (If a reboot is needed, restart these instructions at step 1 after the reboot
         completes.)

      4. Click on the Custom button to identify available updates. 99

      5. Microsoft Update checks for updates and lists the available ones. Figure A-2 shows an
         example of how updates are listed. Depending on the service pack level of the Windows
         XP Home Edition installation CD, either Service Pack 2 or non-service pack updates
         should be displayed. Follow the appropriate step:

          a. Non-service pack updates are grouped by high priority updates, optional software
             updates, and optional hardware updates. 100 Install them using the following steps:

                 i. Review the list of available updates, select the desired ones (or accept the
                    default setting), then click Review and install updates. In some cases, one
                    patch may need to be installed by itself; therefore, it may not be possible to
                    install all desired patches at once.

                ii. Confirm that the correct updates are listed, and click the Install Updates button
                    to perform the installations. Review any licensing agreements that are
                    displayed and click on the appropriate button for each.

                iii. The download and installation process will begin. Depending on the number of
                     updates and the network bandwidth available, it may take from a few minutes to
                     a few hours to download and install the updates. When the installations are

98
      Because the predecessor to Microsoft Update was named Windows Update, Windows XP Home Edition
      computers that are not fully updated may display “Windows Update” instead of “Microsoft Update” on some
      screens. This should not be a cause for concern; during the update process, Windows Update will eventually be
      replaced with Microsoft Update.
99
      The Custom option can install both high priority and optional updates, and allows the user to select which
      updates should be installed. The Express option can only install high priority updates, and does not allow the
      user to specify which updates should be installed. Using the Express option may cause the system to download
      and install service packs automatically.
100
      High priority updates are defined as critical updates, hotfixes, service packs, and security rollups. Optional
      updates are unrelated to fixing security problems, but may contain new security features.


                                                        A-5
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


                     done, Microsoft Update should report which updates were successfully
                     installed. It will also prompt the user to reboot the computer if any of the
                     updates require a reboot to complete the installation. Click on OK to reboot
                     immediately or Cancel to manually reboot the computer later.

          b. Service Pack 2 can be installed through Microsoft Update using the following
             steps: 101

                 i. Click on Download and Install Now.

                 ii. Review the license agreement and click on the appropriate button.

                iii. Service Pack 2 should be downloaded and installed. This may take considerable
                     time, depending primarily on the size of the service pack and the type of
                     Internet connectivity and bandwidth available. The Windows XP Service Pack
                     2 Setup Wizard may prompt the user at some point; click Next to continue.

                iv. Once the installation has ended, a summary should be displayed that reports the
                    installation was successful. Click Restart Now to reboot the computer.

                 v. After the reboot, the Help protect your PC screen appears. The Automatic
                    Updates setting is configured later in the instructions, so at this time, choose the
                    Not right now option and click Next.

                vi. The Security Center opens and displays the status of security programs. Since
                    antivirus software and other security programs have not yet been installed on
                    the computer, the current status is irrelevant. Close the Security Center.

      6. Repeat all of these steps until no more updates are available. Depending on which
         service pack was included with the Windows XP Home Edition CD, and the number of
         additional updates that need to be applied, it may take several rounds of updating the
         computer and rebooting it to bring a new Windows XP Home Edition installation
         completely up-to-date.




101
      If a service pack is being installed from a CD instead of through Microsoft Update, the steps to be performed
      will differ.

                                           Figure A-2. Microsoft Update


During the updating process, the computer may state that additional updates cannot be
downloaded until Windows XP Home Edition has been validated or activated. If so, follow the
instructions provided by Windows XP Home Edition to activate the software through the
Internet, dial-up, or telephone.

It is also important to update other applications on the Windows XP Home Edition computer.
Follow these steps for each application:

      1. Install the application. 102

      2. Review its documentation for guidance on how to update it and how to configure it to
         update itself automatically (if possible).

      3. Implement the vendor’s recommendations. If needed, either close and restart the
         application or reboot the computer so that the changes take effect.

102
      It is often advantageous to install applications such as e-mail clients and Web browsers before installing
      security software. For example, when antivirus software is installed, it may automatically identify installed
      email clients and configure itself so that it monitors their activity for malware.

GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION



Step 4: Configure the Computer for Automatic Updates

To keep Windows XP Home Edition fully updated at all times, the Automatic Updates service
should be enabled.

   1. From Control Panel, double-click Automatic Updates.

   2. Choose the appropriate radio button, as shown in Figure A-3.

        If the computer has high-speed Internet access, select Automatic (recommended).
          Then select the frequency and timeframe in which the updates should be downloaded
          and installed (e.g., every day at 3:00 A.M.)
        If the computer has low-speed Internet access, select Notify me but don’t
          automatically download or install them. This allows the user to control when
          updates are downloaded.
   3. Click on OK to save the Automatic Updates configuration.




                        Figure A-3. Automatic Updates Configuration

Step 5: Install and Configure Antivirus/Antispyware Software

Users should next install malware protection utilities. Antivirus software is a necessity, and
antispyware software is also recommended if the antivirus software does not include a robust
antispyware capability itself. Install the antivirus software (and separate antispyware software, if
needed) using the documentation provided with the software. During the software installation
process or immediately afterward, the software should be configured as follows using directions
provided within the software documentation:

 Scan critical operating system components such as startup files, memory, system BIOS, and
   boot records
 Perform real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened, or executed

 Monitor common applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, file transfer and file
   sharing programs, and instant messaging software
 Scan all hard drives regularly (at least once a week)

 Attempt to disinfect files, and quarantine infected files that cannot be disinfected

 Automatically download and install updates daily.

After installation, the software should be fully updated. Consult the software documentation or
help files for directions on how to download and install updates. Most antivirus software and
antispyware software have a menu option that causes the software to check for, download, and
install updates immediately. After doing so, it may be necessary to repeat the update process
once or a few times, because some updates might need to be installed before other updates.
Also, it may be necessary to reboot the computer after applying certain updates.

Step 6: Set Up Limited User Accounts

A separate limited user account needs to be set up for each person that will be using the
computer.

   1. From the Control Panel, double-click on User Accounts.

   2. For each person that will be using the computer, create an account:

       a. Click Create a new account.

       b. Enter the user name; it can be up to 20 characters long and contain letters, numbers,
          spaces, and some other types of punctuation. When finished, click the Next button.

       c. Set the account type to Limited, then click on the Create Account button.

       d. Have the user choose a strong password and enter it after clicking Create a
          password. Ask the user not to enter a password hint.

Appendix B—Advanced Security Settings
Appendix B contains step-by-step instructions for implementing additional security
recommendations on Windows XP Home Edition computers running Service Pack 2.

The steps throughout this appendix should be performed only by advanced users with
strong knowledge of Windows XP Home Edition security features. The actions performed
in this section may be difficult to perform, or they may be difficult to undo if problems
occur. Implementing the recommendations in this appendix will further improve the
security of Windows XP Home Edition computers, but adequate security can be achieved
without them by implementing the other recommendations presented throughout this
document.

B.1       Configure Data Execution Prevention

Advanced users should consider enabling the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) feature for all
programs and services, as described in Section 3.3.7. By default, the feature only works for
essential Windows programs and services; enabling it for all programs and services provides
more robust protection. However, the DEP feature might cause certain applications to
malfunction, so users that fully enable DEP should monitor their applications’ behavior closely
after configuring it and reconfigure DEP if problems occur. 103 To fully enable DEP, perform the
following steps:

      1. From the Control Panel, double-click on System. The System Properties window
         should be displayed.

      2. Click on the Advanced tab. Within the Performance pane, click the Settings button.

      3. From the Performance Options window, click the Data Execution Prevention tab.

      4. Choose the Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select option.

      5. Click on OK.

B.2       Disable Default User Accounts

Windows XP Home Edition includes several default user accounts that are not shown in the User
Accounts listing in Control Panel. 104 These accounts are enabled by default, so it is possible that
attackers could attempt to use them to gain unauthorized access to the computer. To disable
these accounts, advanced users should perform the following steps:



103
      If problems occur, perform the numbered steps and change step 4 so that the Turn on DEP for essential
      Windows programs and services only option is chosen.
104
      Although the Guest account appears in the User Accounts listing, it can only be partially disabled from there.
      The directions in this section can be used to disable the Guest account fully.


                                                          B-1
GUIDANCE FOR SECURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION


      1. Click the Start menu, choose All Programs, select Accessories, and click on Command
         Prompt.

      2. Within the Command Prompt window, type in the command

          net user Support_388945a0 /active:no

          and hit the Enter key to run it. 105 The response should be The command completed
          successfully. If not, confirm that the command was typed correctly and enter it again if
          needed. Figure B-1 shows the command and expected response.

      3. If the computer does not need to share any folders or printers with other computers, then
         type in the following command within the Command Prompt window:

          net user guest /active:no

          and hit the Enter key to run it. The response should be The command completed
          successfully. If not, confirm that the command was typed correctly and enter it again if
          needed. 106

      4. If the computer will not be using the Remote Assistance feature, then type in the
         following command within the Command Prompt window:

          net user HelpAssistant /active:no

          and hit the Enter key to run it. The response should be The command completed
          successfully. If not, confirm that the command was typed correctly and enter it again if
          needed. 107

      5. Close the Command Prompt.

      If the account needs to be enabled at some time, perform the same command, changing the no to yes.
106
      If there is a need in the future to share folders or printers, perform the step again, substituting yes for no.
107
      If there is a need in the future to use the Remote Assistance feature, perform the step again, substituting yes for
      no.

B.3    Disable Unneeded Networking Features

To disable unneeded networking services, advanced users should perform the following steps for
each network connection:
   1. From the Control Panel, select Network Connections. Right-click on the network
      connection and select Properties. A window similar to the one shown in Figure B-2
      should be displayed.

   2. Uncheck the box for QoS Packet Scheduler.

   3. If the computer will not be sharing its files or printers with other computers on the user’s
      home network, uncheck the box for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.

   4. If the computer will not be accessing any shared folders or printers on other computers on
      the user’s home network, uncheck the box for Client for Microsoft Networks.

B.4       Protect Temporary Files

To ensure that each user has a separate directory for temporary files, advanced users should
perform the following steps:

      1. From the Control Panel, select System, then click on the Advanced tab. Click on the
         Environment Variables button.

      2. In the System variables pane, look for the values assigned to TEMP and TMP:

          a. Double-click on the entry for TEMP. The Variable value should contain a value that
             includes %USERPROFILE%, such as %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp.
             If not, modify it so that it is %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp. Click on
             OK to close the window.

          b. Double-click on the entry for TMP. The Variable value should contain a value that
             includes %USERPROFILE%, such as %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp.
             If not, modify it so that it is %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp. Click on
             OK to close the window.

      3. Click OK, then OK.

If one or more users want to have additional protection for their personal files, then acquire,
install, and configure a third-party encryption product according to the vendor’s
documentation. 108

B.5       Disable Unneeded Services

Advanced users should disable unneeded services on the computer, as described in Section 3.1.5.
The services that are the most likely candidates to be disabled are as follows:

 ClipBook. This service permits users to share copied text and graphics with other users. It
      should be disabled unless there is a specific desire to share data through the Clipbook instead
      of other means, such as e-mail or Shared Folders.
 Infrared Monitor. This should be disabled if there is no need to use a computer’s infrared
      sensor.
 NetMeeting Remote Desktop Sharing. This service, which is used for online conferencing
      with other people, should be disabled unless it is needed.
 Routing and Remote Access. This service should be disabled unless the Internet
      Connection Sharing feature is needed.

108
      An alternative is to use Windows XP Professional instead of Windows XP Home Edition. Windows XP
      Professional has the Encrypting File System (EFS), which is a built-in file encryption feature. Windows XP
      Professional offers other file and folder protection features that Windows XP Home Edition does not, such as
      specifying which types of actions can be performed on each file by each user (e.g., reading, writing, deleting).

 Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Device Host and SSDP Discovery Service. These
   services should be disabled unless the computer will be interacting with UPnP-enabled
   consumer electronics devices connected to the same local network.
 Wireless Zero Configuration. This service should be disabled on any computer that is not
   using wireless networking.
To disable unneeded services, advanced users should perform the following steps:

   1. From the Control Panel, select Administrative Tools, then double-click on Services.

   2. For each service to be disabled:

       a. Double-click on the name of the service. Figure B-3 shows an example of the
          window that should appear.

       b. Set the Startup type to Disabled.

       c. Click on OK.

   3. Close the Services window and the Administrative Tools window.
