                                               Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) of 2002, P.L. 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency
operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security
systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information
is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. However, it may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies
in implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and in
managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are developed by NIST in accordance
          with FISMA. FIPS are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with
          these standards, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Guidance documents and recommendations are issued in the NIST Special Publication
          (SP) 800-series. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies (including OMB
          FISMA Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and
          Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs and
          systems, agencies must follow NIST guidance. 1
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency and internal reports (NISTIRs)
          and ITL Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities.
          These publications are mandatory only when so specified by OMB.

                   Schedule for Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines
     •    For legacy information systems, agencies are expected to be in compliance with NIST
          security standards and guidelines within one year of the publication date unless otherwise
                                     2
          directed by OMB or NIST.
     •    For information systems under development, agencies are expected to be in compliance
          with NIST security standards and guidelines immediately upon deployment of the
          system.




1
 While agencies are required to follow NIST guidance in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility within
NIST’s guidance in how agencies apply the guidance. Unless otherwise specified by OMB, the 800-series guidance
documents published by NIST generally allow agencies some latitude in their application. Consequently, the
application of NIST guidance by agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable,
compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems.
When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, inspectors general, evaluators, and/or assessors
should consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the particular guidance document
and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission responsibilities, operational
environments, and unique organizational conditions.
2
 The one-year compliance date for revisions to NIST Special Publications applies only to the new and/or updated
material in the publications resulting from the periodic revision process. Agencies are expected to be in compliance
with previous versions of NIST Special Publications within one year of the publication date of the previous versions.

                         FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT
                              IMPLEMENTING SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

    FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, is a
    mandatory, non-waiverable standard developed in response to the Federal Information Security
    Management Act of 2002. To comply with the federal standard, agencies must first determine the
    security category of their information system in accordance with the provisions of FIPS 199,
    Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and then
    apply the appropriate set of baseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as
    amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Agencies have
    flexibility in applying the baseline security controls in accordance with the tailoring guidance
    provided in Special Publication 800-53. This allows agencies to adjust the security controls to
    more closely fit their mission requirements and operational environments.
    The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires a foundational level of
    security for all federal information and information systems. The agency's risk assessment
    validates the security control set and determines if any additional controls are needed to protect
    agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals,
    other organizations, or the Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of
    “security due diligence” for the federal agency and its contractors.
    In addition to the security requirements established by FISMA, there may also be specific security
    requirements in different business areas within agencies that are governed by other laws, Executive
    Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or associated governing documents, (e.g., the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Federal Financial Management
    Improvement Act of 1996, or OMB Circular A-127 on Financial Management Systems). These
    requirements may not be equivalent to the security requirements and implementing security
    controls required by FISMA or may enhance or further refine the security requirements and security
    controls. It is important that agency officials (including authorizing officials, chief information
    officers, senior agency information security officers, information system owners, information
    system security officers, and acquisition authorities) take steps to ensure that: (i) all appropriate
    security requirements are addressed in agency acquisitions of information systems and information
    system services; and (ii) all required security controls are implemented in agency information
    systems. See http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert/ca-compliance.html for additional information on FISMA
    compliance.

                    DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                              COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

  In developing standards and guidelines required by the Federal Information Security Management Act
  (FISMA), NIST consults with other federal agencies and offices as well as the private sector to improve
  information security, avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST standards
  and guidelines are complementary with standards and guidelines employed for the protection of
  national security systems. In addition to its comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is
  working with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense
  (DOD), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for
  information security across the federal government. The common foundation for information security
  will provide the Intelligence, Defense, and Civil sectors of the federal government and their support
  contractors, more uniform and consistent ways to manage the risk to organizational operations,
  organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation that results from the operation
  and use of information systems. In another collaboration initiative, NIST is working with public and
  private sector entities to establish specific mappings and relationships between the security standards
  and guidelines developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization and
  International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001, Information Security Management
  System (ISMS).

                                                      Preface

Security control assessments are not about checklists, simple pass-fail results, or generating
paperwork to pass inspections or audits—rather, security controls assessments are the principal
vehicle used to verify that the implementers and operators of information systems are meeting
their stated security goals and objectives. NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for
Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems, is written to facilitate security
control assessments conducted within an effective risk management framework. The assessment
results provide organizational officials:
•      Evidence about the effectiveness of security controls in organizational information systems;
•      An indication of the quality of the risk management processes employed within the
       organization; and
•      Information about the strengths and weaknesses of information systems which are supporting
       critical federal missions and applications in a global environment of sophisticated threats.

The findings produced by assessors are used primarily in determining the overall effectiveness of
the security controls in an information system and in providing credible and meaningful inputs to
the organization’s security accreditation (information system authorization) process. A well-
executed assessment helps to determine the validity of the security controls contained in the
security plan (and subsequently employed in the information system) and to facilitate a cost-
effective approach to correcting any deficiencies in the system in an orderly and disciplined
manner consistent with the organization’s mission/business requirements.

NIST Special Publication 800-53A is a companion guideline to NIST Special Publication 800-53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Each publication provides
guidance for implementing the steps in the NIST Risk Management Framework. 3 NIST Special
Publication 800-53 covers the steps in the Risk Management Framework that address security
control selection (i.e., determining what security controls are needed to protect organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation) in accordance with the
security requirements in FIPS 200. 4 This includes: (i) selecting an initial set of baseline security
controls based on a FIPS 199 worst-case, impact analysis; 5 (ii) tailoring the baseline security
controls; and (iii) supplementing the security controls, as necessary, based on an organizational
assessment of risk. NIST Special Publication 800-53A covers both the security control
assessment and continuous monitoring steps in the Risk Management Framework and provides
guidance on the security assessment process. This guidance includes how to build effective
security assessment plans and how to manage assessment results.

NIST Special Publication 800-53A has been developed with the intention of enabling
organizations to tailor and supplement the basic assessment procedures provided. The concepts
of tailoring and supplementation used in this document are similar to the concepts described in
NIST Special Publication 800-53. Tailoring involves scoping the assessment procedures to
match the characteristics of the information system under assessment. The tailoring process
provides organizations with the flexibility needed to avoid assessment approaches that are

unnecessarily extensive or more rigorous than necessary. Supplementation involves adding
assessment procedures or assessment details to adequately meet the organization’s risk
management needs (e.g., adding assessment objectives or adding organization-specific details
such as system/platform-specific information for selected security controls). Supplementation
decisions are left to the discretion of the organization in order to maximize flexibility in
developing security assessment plans when applying the results of risk assessments in
determining the extent, rigor, and level of intensity of the assessments.

While flexibility continues to be an important factor in developing security assessment plans,
consistency of assessments is also an important consideration. A major design objective for
NIST Special Publication 800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and initial starting
point for assessment procedures that are essential for achieving such consistency. In addition to
the assessment framework and initial starting point for assessment procedures, NIST initiated an
Assessment Case Development Project. 6 The purpose of the project is threefold: (i) to actively
engage experienced assessors from multiple organizations in the development of a representative
set of assessment cases corresponding to the assessment procedures in NIST Special Publication
800-53A; (ii) to provide organizations and the assessors supporting those organizations with an
exemplary set of assessment cases for each assessment procedure in the catalog of procedures in
this publication; and (iii) to provide a vehicle for ongoing community-wide review of and
comment on the assessment cases to promote continuous improvement in the assessment process
for more consistent, cost-effective security assessments of federal information systems. The
Assessment Case Development Project is described in Appendix J.

In addition to the above project, NIST also initiated the Information Security Automation
Program (ISAP) and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) that support and complement
the approach for achieving consistent, cost-effective security control assessments outlined in this
publication. The primary purpose of the ISAP/SCAP is to improve the automated application,
verification, and reporting of commercial information technology product-specific security
configuration settings, thereby reducing vulnerabilities when products are not configured
properly. The ultimate objective is to achieve a direct linkage, where appropriate, of the
assessment procedures found in NIST Special Publication 800-53A to the SCAP automated
testing of information system mechanisms and associated security configuration settings. 7

Finally, it should be noted that for environments with credible threat information indicating
sophisticated, well-resourced threat agents and possible attacks against high-value targets,
additional assurances may be required. NIST Special Publication 800-53 indicates the need for
explicit risk acceptance or additional assurances for moderate-impact and high-impact
information systems whenever the organization is relying on one or more security controls to
mitigate risks from more capable threat sources. In a similar manner, NIST Special Publication
800-53A recognizes that, for such controls, additional organizationally-derived assessment
activities will likely be required. These additional assessment activities will include the
assessment objectives associated with verifying the Additional Requirements Enhancing
Moderate-impact and High-impact Information Systems in Appendix E of NIST Special
Publication 800-53—that is, the security controls in the information system are developed in a
manner that supports a high degree of confidence the controls are complete, consistent, and
correct, resulting in a greater degree of trustworthiness and penetration resistance of the system.

6
  An assessment case represents a worked example of an assessment procedure that provides specific actions that an
assessor might carry out during the assessment of a security control or control enhancement in an information system.

                                          CAUTIONARY NOTES
     Organizations should carefully consider the potential impacts of employing the procedures
     defined in this Special Publication when assessing the security controls in operational
     information systems. Certain assessment procedures, particularly those procedures that directly
     impact the operation of hardware, software, and/or firmware components of an information
     system, may inadvertently affect the routine processing, transmission, or storage of information
     supporting critical organizational missions or business functions. For example, a key
     information system component may be taken offline for assessment purposes or a component
     may suffer a fault or failure during the assessment process. Organizations should take necessary
     precautions during security control assessment periods to ensure that organizational missions
     and business functions continue to be supported by the information system and that only
     approved impacts to operational effectiveness are caused by the assessment.
     Security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended) have been restated in
     NIST Special Publication 800-53A for ease of reference by assessors in specifying assessment
     procedures for conducting assessments of security controls and should not be viewed as
     replacing or revising the security controls in Special Publication 800-53, which remains the
     definitive NIST recommendation for employing security controls in federal information systems.
     Unless otherwise stated, all references to NIST publications in this document (i.e., Federal
     Information Processing Standards and Special Publications) are to the most recent version of the

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO ASSESS SECURITY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

        oday’s information systems 8 are incredibly complex assemblages of technology (including

T       hardware, software, and firmware), processes, and people, all working together to provide
        organizations with the capability to process, store, and transmit information on a timely
basis to support various organizational missions and business functions. The degree to which
organizations have come to depend upon these information systems to conduct routine and
critical missions and business functions means that the protection of the underlying systems is
paramount to the success of the organization. The selection of appropriate security controls for
an information system is an important task that can have major implications on the operations and
assets of an organization as well as the welfare of individuals. 9 Security controls are the
management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an
information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity (including non-repudiation and
authenticity), and availability of the system and its information. Once employed within an
information system, security controls are assessed to provide the information necessary to
determine their overall effectiveness; that is, the extent to which the controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system. Understanding the overall effectiveness of the security
controls implemented in the information system is essential in determining the risk to the
organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation
resulting from the use of the system.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for building effective security assessment
plans and a comprehensive set of procedures for assessing the effectiveness of security controls
employed in information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines apply to the security controls defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as
amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, and any additional
security controls developed by the organization. The guidelines have been developed to help
achieve more secure information systems within the federal government by:
•    Enabling more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security controls;
•    Facilitating more cost-effective assessments of security controls contributing to the
     determination of overall control effectiveness;
•    Promoting a better understanding of the risks to organizational operations, organizational
     assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use
     of federal information systems; and
•    Creating more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for organizational officials—to
     support security accreditation decisions, information sharing, and FISMA compliance.

8
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
9
 When selecting security controls for an information system, the organization also considers potential impacts to other
organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives,
potential national-level impacts.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                     PAGE 1
Special Publication 800-53A                     Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


The guidelines provided in this special publication are applicable to all federal information
systems other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C.,
Section 3542. The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to
complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems
with the approval of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the Secretary of Defense
(SECDEF), the Chairman of the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), or their
designees. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations that
compose the critical infrastructure of the United States, are also encouraged to consider the use of
these guidelines, as appropriate.

Organizations should use as a minimum, NIST Special Publication 800-53A in conjunction with
an approved security plan in developing a viable security assessment plan for producing and
compiling the information necessary to determine the effectiveness of the security controls
employed in the information system. This publication has been developed with the intention of
enabling organizations to tailor and supplement the basic assessment procedures provided. The
assessment procedures should be used as a starting point for and as input to the security
assessment plan. In developing effective security assessment plans, organizations should take
into consideration existing information about the security controls to be assessed (e.g., results
from organizational assessments of risk, platform-specific dependencies in the hardware,
software, or firmware, 10 and any assessment procedures needed as a result of organization-
specific controls not included in NIST Special Publication 800-53).

The selection of appropriate assessment procedures for a particular information system depends
on three factors:
•    The security categorization of the information system in accordance with FIPS 199,
     Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and
     NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information
     Systems to Security Categories;
•    The security controls identified in the approved security plan, including those from NIST
     Special Publication 800-53 (as amended) and any organization-specific controls; 11 and
•    The level of assurance that the organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the
     security controls in the information system.

The extent of security control assessments should always be risk-driven. Organizations should
determine the most cost-effective implementation of this key element in the organization’s
information security program by applying the results of risk assessments, considering the
maturity and quality level of the organization’s risk management processes, and taking advantage
of the flexibility in NIST Special Publication 800-53A. The use of Special Publication 800-53A
as a starting point in the process of defining procedures for assessing the security controls in
information systems, promotes a more consistent level of security within the organization and
offers the needed flexibility to customize the assessment based on organizational policies and
requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, operational considerations, information
10
  For example, detailed test scripts may need to be developed for the specific operating system, network component,
middleware, or application employed within the information system to adequately assess certain characteristics of a
particular security control. Such test scripts are at a lower level of detail than provided by the assessment procedures
contained in Appendix F (Assessment Procedures Catalog) and are therefore beyond the scope of this publication.
11
  The agreed-upon security controls for the information system are documented in the security plan after the initial
selection of the controls as described in NIST Special Publication 800-53. The security plan is approved by appropriate
organizational officials prior to the start of the security control assessment.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                       PAGE 2

system and platform dependencies, and tolerance for risk. 12 Ultimately, organizations should
view assessment as an information gathering activity, not a security producing activity. The
information produced during security control assessments can be used by an organization to:
•    Identify potential problems or shortfalls in the organization’s implementation of the NIST
     Risk Management Framework;
•    Identify information system weaknesses and deficiencies;
•    Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and associated risk mitigation activities;
•    Confirm that identified weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system have been
     addressed;
•    Support information system authorization (i.e., security accreditation) decisions; and
•    Support budgetary decisions and the capital investment process.

Organizations are not expected to employ all of the assessment methods and assessment objects
contained within the assessment procedures identified in this document. Rather, organizations
have the flexibility to determine the security control assessment level of effort and resources
expended (e.g., which assessment methods and objects are employed in the assessment). This
determination is made on the basis of what will most cost-effectively accomplish the assessment
objectives defined in this publication with sufficient confidence to support the subsequent
determination of the resulting mission or business risk.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of information system and information
security professionals including:
•    Individuals with information system and security control assessment and monitoring
     responsibilities (e.g., system evaluators, assessors/assessment teams, certification
     agents/certification teams, independent verification and validation assessors, auditors,
     inspectors general, information system owners);
•    Individuals with information system and security management and oversight responsibilities
     (e.g., authorizing officials, senior agency information security officers, information security
     managers);
•    Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
     information system owners, mission/information owners, and information system security
     officers); and
•    Individuals with information system development and integration responsibilities (e.g.,
     program managers, information technology product developers, information system
     developers, systems integrators).




12
   In this publication, the term risk is used to mean risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PUBLICATIONS
NIST Special Publication 800-53A 13 has been designed to be used with NIST Special Publication
800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.
In particular, the assessment procedures contained in this publication and the guidelines provided
for developing security assessment plans for organizational information systems directly support
the security certification and continuous monitoring activities that are integral to the certification
and accreditation process. Security certification, like any security control assessment, helps to
determine if the security controls in the information system are effective in their application (i.e.,
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting the security requirements of the system). As the information system moves into the
continuous monitoring phase (subsequent to security accreditation), organizations can select a
subset of the assessment procedures from the security assessment plan to assess a subset of the
security controls on an ongoing basis. The procedures selected for the follow-on assessments are
based on an organizational assessment of risk, the plan of action and milestones for the
information system, and organizational security policies, any of which may indicate the need for
greater emphasis on assessment of selected security controls.

Organizations are encouraged, whenever possible, to take advantage of the assessment results and
associated assessment-related documentation and evidence available on information system
components from previous assessments including independent third-party testing, evaluation, and
validation. 14 Product testing, evaluation, and validation may be conducted on cryptographic
modules and general-purpose information technology products such as operating systems,
database systems, firewalls, intrusion detection devices, web browsers, web applications, smart
cards, biometrics devices, personal identity verification devices, network devices, and hardware
platforms using national and international standards. If an information system component
product is identified as providing support for the implementation of a particular security control
in NIST Special Publication 800-53, then any available evidence produced during the product
testing, evaluation, and validation processes (e.g., security specifications, analyses and test
results, validation reports, and validation certificates) 15 should be used to the extent that it is
applicable. This evidence should be combined with the assessment-related evidence obtained
from the application of the assessment procedures in this publication, to cost-effectively produce
the information necessary to determine whether the security controls are effective or ineffective
in their application.




13
  NIST Special Publication 800-53A is a companion publication to NIST Special Publication 800-53, not a
replacement or update. Special Publication 800-53 remains the definitive NIST recommendation for employing
security controls in federal information systems.
14
  Assessment results can be obtained from many activities that occur routinely during the System Development Life
Cycle processes within organizations. For example, assessment results are produced during the testing and evaluation
of new information system components during system upgrades or system integration activities. Organizations should
take advantage of previous assessment results whenever possible, to reduce the overall cost of assessments and to make
the assessment process more efficient.
15
  Organizations should review the component product’s available information to determine: (i) what security controls
are implemented by the product; (ii) if those security controls meet intended control requirements of the information
system under assessment; (iii) if the configuration of the product and the environment in which the product operates are
consistent with the environmental and product configuration as stated by the vendor/developer; and (iv) if the assurance
requirements stated in the developer/vendor specification satisfy the assurance requirements for assessing those
controls. Meeting the above criteria provides a sound rationale that the product is suitable and meets the intended
security control requirements of the information system under assessment.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T      his chapter describes the basic concepts associated with assessing the security controls in
       organizational information systems including: (i) the integration of assessments into the
       system development life cycle; (ii) the importance of an organization-wide strategy for
conducting security control assessments; (iii) the development of effective assurance cases; (iv)
the format and content of assessment procedures; and (v) the use of an extended assessment
procedure to help increase the grounds for confidence in the effectiveness of the security controls
being assessed.

2.1 ASSESSMENTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Security assessments can be effectively carried out at various stages in the system development
life cycle 16 to increase the grounds for confidence or assurance that the security controls
employed with an information system are effective in their application. This publication provides
a comprehensive set of assessment procedures to support security assessment activities during the
system development life cycle. For example, security assessments should be conducted by
information system developers and system integrators during the system development and
acquisition phase of the life cycle to help ensure that required security controls for the system are
properly designed, developed, and implemented. This assessment process is often referred to as
developmental security testing and evaluation (ST&E). The assessment procedures described in
Appendix F can assist in developing ST&E procedures that can be employed during the initial
stages of the system development life cycle. Security assessments should also be conducted by
information system owners, security officers, independent certification agents, auditors, and
inspectors general during the operations and maintenance phase of the life cycle to help ensure
that the security controls are effective in the operational environment where the system is
deployed. Finally, at the end of the life cycle, security assessments should be conducted as part
of ensuring, for example, that important organizational information is purged from the
information system prior to disposal.

2.2 STRATEGY FOR CONDUCTING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Organizations are encouraged to develop a broad-based, organization-wide strategy for
conducting security assessments, facilitating more cost-effective and consistent assessments
across the inventory of information systems. An organization-wide strategy begins by applying
the initial steps of the Risk Management Framework to all information systems within the
organization, with an organizational view of the security categorization process, the security
control selection process, and the identification of common (inherited) security controls.
Maximizing the number of common controls employed within an organization: (i) significantly
reduces the cost of development, implementation, and assessment of security controls; (ii) allows
organizations to centralize security control assessments and to amortize the cost of those
assessments across all information systems organization-wide; and (iii) increases overall security

16
   There are five phases in the system development life cycle: (i) system initiation; (ii) system acquisition/development;
(iii) system implementation; (iv) system operations and maintenance; and (v) system disposition (disposal). NIST
Special Publications 800-64 and 800-100 provide guidance on integrating information security activities into the
specific phases of the system development life cycle.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 6

control consistency. An aggressive, organization-wide approach to identifying common controls
early in the Risk Management Framework process facilitates a more global strategy for assessing
those controls and sharing essential assessment results with information system owners and
authorizing officials. The sharing of assessment results among key officials across information
system boundaries has many important benefits including:
•     Providing the capability to review assessment results for all information systems and to make
      organization-wide, mission/business-related decisions on risk mitigation activities according
      to organizational priorities, organizational assessments of risk, and the impact levels of the
      information systems supporting the organization;
•     Providing a more global view of systemic weaknesses and deficiencies occurring in
      information systems across the organization;
•     Providing an opportunity to develop organization-wide solutions to information security
      problems; and
•     Increasing the organization’s knowledge base regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and strategies
      for more cost-effective solutions to common information security problems.

Figure 1 illustrates the relationship among the independent information system assessments and
the overall determination and acceptance of mission/business risk.

While the conduct of the security control assessment is the primary responsibility of the
information system owner 17 with oversight by the authorizing official, there should be significant
involvement in the assessment process by other parties within the organization who have a vested
interest in the outcome of the assessment. Other interested parties include, for example, mission
and information owners (when those roles are filled by someone other than the information
system owner) and information security officials. It is imperative that the information system
owner coordinate with the other parties in the organization having an interest in the security
control assessment to ensure that the organization’s core missions and business functions are
adequately addressed in the selection of security controls to be assessed.




17
  The information system owner is the organizational official responsible for the overall procurement, development,
integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.3 BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE ASSURANCE CASE
Building an effective assurance case 18 for security control effectiveness is a process that involves:
(i) compiling evidence that the controls employed in the information system are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements of the system; and (ii) presenting this evidence in a manner that decision
makers are able to use effectively in making credible, risk-based decisions about the operation or
use of the system. The evidence described above comes from both the implementation of the
security controls in the information system and from the assessments of that implementation.
Ideally, the assessor is adding to an existing assurance case that started with the specification of
the organization’s information security needs and was further developed during the design,
development, and implementation of the information system.

Assessors obtain the evidence needed during the assessment process to allow the appropriate
organizational officials to make objective determinations about the effectiveness of the security
controls and the security of the information system. The assessment evidence needed to make
such determinations can be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not limited to,
information technology product and system assessments. Product assessments (also known as
product testing and evaluation) are typically conducted by independent, third-party testing
organizations and examine the security functions of products and established configuration
settings. Assessments can be conducted against industry, national, and international information
security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology
products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in
millions of information systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level of
depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the particular products.

System assessments are typically conducted by information systems developers, systems
integrators, certification agents, information system owners, auditors, inspectors general, and the
information security staffs of organizations. These assessors or assessment teams bring together
available information about the information system such as the results from product-level
assessments, if available, and conduct additional system-level assessments using a variety of
methods and techniques. System assessments are used to compile and evaluate the evidence
needed by organizational officials to determine how effective the security controls employed in
the information system are likely to be in mitigating risks to organizational operations and assets,
to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation. The results from assessments conducted
using information system-specific and organization-specific assessment procedures derived from
the guidelines in NIST Special Publication 800-53A contribute to compiling the necessary
evidence to determine security control effectiveness in accordance with the stated assurance
requirements in the security plan (see NIST Special Publication 800-53, Appendix E, Minimum
Assurance Requirements).

2.4 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
An assessment procedure consists of a set of assessment objectives, each with an associated set of
potential assessment methods and assessment objects. An assessment objective includes a set of
determination statements related to the particular security control 19 under assessment. The
18
   An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about an
information system holds (i.e., is assured). An assurance case is needed when it is important to show that a system
exhibits some complex property such as safety, security, or reliability. Additional information can be obtained at
https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/daisy/bsi/articles/knowledge/assurance/643.html.
19
     References to security controls under assessment also include control enhancements.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                     PAGE 8
Special Publication 800-53A                   Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


determination statements are closely linked to the content of the security control (i.e., the security
control functionality) and the assurance requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to
ensure traceability of assessment results back to the fundamental control requirements. The
application of an assessment procedure to a security control produces assessment findings. These
assessment findings are subsequently used in helping to determine the overall effectiveness of the
security control.

The assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and include specifications,
mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g.,
policies, procedures, plans, system security requirements, functional specifications, and
architectural designs) associated with an information system. Mechanisms are the specific
hardware, software, or firmware safeguards and countermeasures employed within an information
system. 20 Activities are the specific protection-related pursuits or actions supporting an
information system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring
network traffic, exercising a contingency plan). Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people
applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

The assessment methods define the nature of the assessor actions and include examine, interview,
and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or
analyzing one or more assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities). The
purpose of the examine method is to facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or
obtain evidence. The interview method is the process of conducting discussions with individuals
or groups of individuals within an organization to once again, facilitate assessor understanding,
achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The test method is the process of exercising one or
more assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare
actual with expected behavior. In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making
specific determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the
objectives for the assessment procedure.

Each of the assessment methods described above has a set of associated attributes, depth and
coverage, which help define the expected level of effort for the assessment. These attributes are
hierarchical in nature, providing the means to define the rigor and scope of the assessment for the
increased assurance needed for higher impact level information systems. The depth attribute
addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination, interview, and testing processes.
Values for the depth attribute include generalized, focused, and detailed. The coverage attribute
addresses the scope or breadth of the examination, interview, and testing processes including the
number and type of specifications, mechanisms, and activities to be examined or tested and the
number and types of individuals to be interviewed. Values for the coverage attribute include
representative, specific, and comprehensive. Appendix D provides attribute definitions and
descriptions of each assessment method. The appropriate depth and coverage attribute values for
a particular assessment method are the values needed to achieve the assessment expectations
defined in Appendix E (described further below) based upon the characteristics of the information
system being assessed (including impact level) and the specific determinations to be made.

Each of the information system impact levels (i.e., low, moderate, high) has an associated set of
minimum assurance requirements defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53. The assurance
requirements are directed at security control developers and implementers. Based on the
assurance requirements, security control developers and implementers carry out required

20
   Mechanisms also include physical protection devices associated with an information system (e.g., locks, keypads,
security cameras, fire protection devices, fireproof safes, etc.).

activities and thereby, as an inherent part of developing or implementing the control, produce the
necessary control documentation, conduct essential analyses, and define actions that must be
performed during control operation. 21 The purpose of these activities is to provide increased
grounds for confidence that the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the information system. Assessors subsequently use the information from these developer and
implementer activities during the assessment process to help build the assurance case that the
security controls are effective in their application. 22

The minimum assurance requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-53 also help to establish
an appropriate set of expectations for assessors in the conduct of the security control assessments.
The assessment expectations, described with respect to low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-
impact information systems for a range of assessment objects including specifications, activities,
and mechanisms, are provided in Appendix E. The assessment expectations provide assessors
with important reference points as to what findings obtained from the application of the
assessment procedures are acceptable for subsequent use by the organization in determining
security control effectiveness. Table 1 provides a summary of the assessment expectations by
information system impact level.

21
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls within an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and
software vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as
information system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other
individuals with security responsibility for the information system.
22
   For example, the assurance requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-53 at the moderate-impact level are
designed to ensure that security controls within the information system contain specific actions and the assignment of
responsibilities to provide increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating
as intended. At the high-impact level, the assurance requirements are designed to ensure that when security controls
are implemented, the controls will continuously and consistently (i.e., across the information system) meet their
required function or purpose and support improvement in the effectiveness of the controls. These requirements are
reflected in the associated security control assessment procedures at the appropriate impact level of the information
system under assessment.

AN EXAMPLE ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE
The following example illustrates an assessment procedure for security control CP-1. The
assessment procedure includes a set of assessment objectives derived from the basic security
control statement and a set of potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to make
the determinations that lead to achieving the assessment objectives.

     CP-1   CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

     Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
     documented, contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
     management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
     formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and
     associated contingency planning controls.
     Supplemental Guidance: The contingency planning policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
     laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The contingency
     planning policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization.
     Contingency planning procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a
     particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-34 provides guidance on
     contingency planning. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and
     procedures.


For security control CP-1, the assessment objectives are expressed as follows:
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE #1
Determine if:
(i) the organization develops and documents contingency planning policy and procedures;
(ii) the organization disseminates contingency planning policy and procedures to appropriate elements
      within the organization;
(iii) responsible parties within the organization periodically review contingency planning policy and
      procedures; and
(iv) the organization updates contingency planning policy and procedures when organizational review
      indicates updates are required.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE #2
Determine if:
(i) the contingency planning policy addresses purpose, scope, roles and responsibilities, management
      commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
(ii) the contingency planning policy is consistent with the organization’s mission and functions and with
      applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance; and
(iii) the contingency planning procedures address all areas identified in the contingency planning policy
      and address achieving policy-compliant implementations of all associated contingency planning
      controls.

In addition to specifying the assessment objectives, potential assessment methods and objects are
also identified. 23 The depth and coverage attributes associated with the assessment methods are
implicit according to the impact level of the information system where the security controls are
employed and assessed. Therefore, the expected level of effort expended by assessors in

23
   Whereas a set of potential assessment methods and objects have been included in the catalog of assessment
procedures in Appendix F, these are not intended to be mandatory or exclusive and, depending on the particular
circumstances of the information system to be assessed, not all methods and objects may be required.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                   PAGE 11

assessing a particular security control (i.e., the intensity and extent of the assessment activities)
will vary based upon the impact level of the information system and the associated depth and
coverage attributes. Appendix E provides more detailed information on assessment expectations
and the values for depth and coverage attributes for each information system impact level. A
complete assessment procedure for security control CP-1 consists of two assessment objectives 24
and associated methods and objects as follows:

 CP-1.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                 Determine if:
                 (i) the organization develops and documents contingency planning policy and
                       procedures;
                 (ii) the organization disseminates contingency planning policy and procedures to
                       appropriate elements within the organization;
                 (iii) responsible parties within the organization periodically review contingency planning
                       policy and procedures; and
                 (iv) the organization updates contingency planning policy and procedures when
                       organizational review indicates updates are required.
                 POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                 Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy and procedures; other relevant documents or
                          records].
                 Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan
                            implementation responsibilities].

 CP-1.2          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                 Determine if:
                 (i) the contingency planning policy addresses purpose, scope, roles and responsibilities,
                       management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                       compliance;
                 (ii) the contingency planning policy is consistent with the organization’s mission and
                       functions and with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                       guidance; and
                 (iii) the contingency planning procedures address all areas identified in the contingency
                       planning policy and address achieving policy-compliant implementations of all
                       associated contingency planning controls.
                 POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                 Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy and procedures; other relevant documents or
                          records].
                 Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning and plan
                            implementation responsibilities].



The assessment objectives within a particular assessment procedure are numbered sequentially
(e.g., CP-1.1,…, CP-1.n). If the security control has any enhancements, assessment objectives are
developed for each enhancement using the same process as for the base control. The resulting
assessment objectives within the assessment procedure are numbered sequentially (e.g., CP-2(1).1
indicating the first assessment objective for the first enhancement for security control CP-2).

24
   In the CP-1 example above, the control requirements are divided among two assessment objectives primarily because
the elements within the security control are of two types—actions (first objective) and adequacy (second objective).
However, an assessment procedure consisting of one objective covering all control requirements would also be
acceptable. The number of objectives is kept as small as possible while still providing a meaningful subdivision of
assessment results and providing for any needed differentiation between objectives and assessment methods that apply.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                  PAGE 12
Special Publication 800-53A                  Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.5 EXTENDED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE
In addition to the assessment procedures (see Appendix F, Section I) that are applied to individual
security controls as in the CP-1 example above, an extended assessment procedure (see Appendix
F, Section II) is applied to the assessment as a whole. The extended assessment procedure is
designed to work with and complement the assessment procedures to contribute to the grounds
for confidence in the effectiveness of the security controls employed in the information system.
The extended assessment procedure and the associated assessment objectives are also closely
linked to the impact level of the information system and the assurance requirements in NIST
Special Publication 800-53. Consider the NIST Special Publication 800-53 assurance
requirements for low-impact systems:
         Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified
         functional requirements in the control statement.
         Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in low-impact information systems, the focus is on the
         controls being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are
         discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner.

The basic assurance requirement for low-impact systems (i.e., security controls are in effect and
meet explicitly identified functional requirements in the control statements) is covered by the
assessment procedures for the security controls (see Appendix F, Section I). An additional
assessment objective for low-impact systems is identified in the supplemental guidance (i.e., as
flaws are discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner). This additional assessment
objective is covered by the extended assessment procedure (see Appendix F, Section II).
Specifically, for a low-impact information system, the following section of the extended
assessment procedure, EAP.1, is applied:

 EAP.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                 Determine if the organization has a process in place to address in a timely manner, any
                 flaws discovered in the implementation or application of the security controls in the
                 information system.
                 POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                 Examine: [SELECT FROM: Policies, procedures, records, documents, activities, or mechanisms related
                          to addressing flaws in security controls or control enhancements].



The extended assessment procedure applies to the entire assessment, yet may be implemented
control by control, by group of controls, or collectively across all controls in the information
system simultaneously. In this situation, the organization, based on the security plan for
implementing the NIST Special Publication 800-53 assurance requirements, may have decided to
have a process in place to address flaws at the individual security control level (e.g., CP-1) or
may have decided to rely on a single process to document and address flaws at the security
control family level (e.g., Contingency Planning family). Extending that concept further, the
organization may have also decided to employ an organization-wide process to document flaws in
the security controls across the entire information system. Whether the organization chooses to
implement one process or many processes will determine how the assessor applies the extended
assessment procedure. The specific application of the extended assessment procedure should be
described in the security assessment plan. See Appendix F, Section II for the complete extended
assessment procedure.




CHAPTER 2                                                                                                   PAGE 13

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T       his chapter describes the process of assessing the security controls in organizational
        information systems including: (i) the activities carried out by organizations and assessors
        to prepare for security control assessments; (ii) the development of security assessment
plans; (iii) the conduct of security control assessments and the analysis, documentation, and
reporting of assessment results; and (iv) post-assessment report analysis and follow-on activities
carried out by organizations.

3.1 PREPARING FOR SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Conducting security control assessments in today’s complex environment of sophisticated
information technology infrastructures and high-visibility, mission-critical applications can be
difficult, challenging, and resource-intensive. Success requires the cooperation and collaboration
among all parties having a vested interest in the organization’s information security posture,
including information system owners, authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior
agency information security officers, chief executive officers/heads of agencies, inspectors
general, and the OMB. Establishing an appropriate set of expectations before, during, and after
the assessment is paramount to achieving an acceptable outcome—that is, producing information
necessary to help the authorizing official make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to place
the information system into operation or continue its operation.

Thorough preparation by the organization and the assessors is an important aspect of conducting
effective security control assessments. Preparatory activities should address a range of issues
relating to the cost, schedule, and performance of the assessment. From the organizational
perspective, preparing for a security control assessment includes the following key activities:
•    Ensuring that appropriate policies covering security control assessments are in place and
     understood by all organizational elements;
•    Ensuring that all steps in the NIST Risk Management Framework prior to the security control
     assessment step, have been successfully completed and received appropriate management
     oversight; 25
•    Ensuring that security controls identified as common controls (and the common portion of
     hybrid controls) have been assigned to appropriate organizational entities for development
     and implementation; 26

25
   Actions to be accomplished in the execution of the Risk Management Framework prior to the assess security controls
step include; (i) developing a security plan that defines the security controls for the information system; (ii) assessing
this plan for completeness, correctness, and compliance with federal and organizational requirements; (iii) appropriate
organizational officials approving the plan; and (iv) implementing the security controls called out in the plan. The
security plan assessment represents, along with a verification that appropriate officials have approved the plan, the
assessment of security controls PL-2 and, as appropriate, PL-3. The assessment of security control PL-2 (and PL-3)
provides key information to be used by authorizing officials in their determination whether or not to approve the
security plan, and hence represent assessment activity that should be completed prior to the formal security controls
assessment step in the Risk Management Framework.
26
   The security control assessment may include common controls that are the responsibility of organizational entities
other than the information system owner inheriting the controls or hybrid controls where there is shared responsibility
among the system owner and designated organizational entities.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                      PAGE 14
Special Publication 800-53A                    Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Establishing the objective and scope of the security control assessment (i.e., the purpose of
     the assessment and what is being assessed);
•    Notifying key organizational officials of the impending security control assessment and
     allocating necessary resources to carry out the assessment;
•    Establishing appropriate communication channels among organizational officials having an
     interest in the security control assessment; 27
•    Establishing time frames for completing the security control assessment and key milestone
     decision points required by the organization to effectively manage the assessment;
•    Identifying and selecting a competent assessor/assessment team that will be responsible for
     conducting the security control assessment, considering issues of assessor independence;
•    Collecting artifacts to provide to the assessor/assessment team (e.g., policies, procedures,
     plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system
     documentation, interconnection agreements, previous assessment results); and
•    Establishing a mechanism between the organization and the assessor and/or assessment team
     to minimize ambiguities or misunderstandings about security control implementation or
     security control weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the assessment.

In addition to the planning activities the organization carries out in preparation for the security
control assessment, assessors/assessment teams should begin preparing for the assessment by:
•    Obtaining a general understanding of the organization’s operations (including mission,
     functions, and business processes) and how the information system that is the subject of the
     security control assessment supports those organizational operations;
•    Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the information system (i.e., system
     architecture);
•    Obtaining a thorough understanding of the security controls being assessed (including
     system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) together with appropriate FIPS and NIST
     Special Publications that are referenced in those controls;
•    Identifying the organizational entities responsible for the development and implementation of
     the common security controls (or the common portion of hybrid controls) supporting the
     information system;
•    Establishing appropriate organizational points of contact needed to carry out the security
     control assessment;
•    Obtaining artifacts needed for the security control assessment (e.g., policies, procedures,
     plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system
     documentation, interconnection agreements, previous assessment results);
•    Obtaining previous assessment results that may be appropriately reused for the security
     control assessment (e.g., inspector general reports, audits, vulnerability scans, physical
     security inspections; prior assessments of common controls, developmental testing and
     evaluation).

27
   Typically, these individuals include authorizing officials, information system owners, mission and information
owners (if other than the information system owner), chief information officers, senior agency information security
officers, inspectors general, information system security officers, users from organizations that the information system
supports, and assessors (e.g., certification agents/teams, independent auditors).



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                      PAGE 15
Special Publication 800-53A                    Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Meeting with appropriate organizational officials to ensure common understanding for
     assessment objectives and the proposed rigor and scope of the assessment; and
•    Developing a security assessment plan.

In preparation for the assessment of security controls, the necessary background information
should be assembled and made available to the assessors or assessment team. 28 To the extent
necessary to support the specific assessment, the organization should identify and arrange access
to: (i) elements of the organization responsible for developing, documenting, disseminating,
reviewing, and updating all security policies and associated procedures for implementing policy-
compliant controls; (ii) the security policies for the information system and any associated
implementing procedures; (iii) individuals or groups responsible for the development,
implementation, operation, and maintenance of security controls; (iv) any materials (e.g., security
plans, records, schedules, assessment reports, after-action reports, agreements, accreditation
packages) associated with the implementation and operation of security controls; and (v) the
objects to be assessed. 29 The availability of essential documentation as well as access to key
organizational personnel and the information system being assessed are paramount to a successful
assessment of the security controls.

3.2 DEVELOPING SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLANS
The security assessment plan provides the objectives for the security control assessment and a
detailed roadmap of how to conduct such an assessment. The output and end result of the
security control assessment is the security assessment report, which documents the assurance
case for the information system and is one of three key documents in the security accreditation
package developed by information system owners for authorizing officials. 30 The security
assessment report includes information from the assessor (in the form of assessment findings)
necessary to determine the effectiveness of the security controls employed in the information
system and the organization’s overall effectiveness determination based upon the assessor’s
findings. 31 The security assessment report is an important factor in an authorizing official’s
determination of risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation),
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Appendix I provides
additional information on the format and content of security assessment reports.

The following steps should be considered by assessors in developing plans to assess the security
controls in organizational information systems:
•    Determine the type of security control assessment (e.g., complete or partial assessment);
•    Determine which security controls/control enhancements are to be included in the assessment
     based upon the contents of the security plan and the purpose/scope of the assessment;

28
   Information system owners and organizational entities developing, implementing, and/or administering common
security controls are responsible for providing needed information to assessors/assessment teams.
29
   In situations where there are multiple security control assessments ongoing or planned within an organization, access
to organizational elements, individuals, and artifacts supporting the assessments should be centrally managed by the
organization to ensure a cost-effective use of time and resources.
30
   In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-37, the security accreditation package consists of the security plan
(including the risk assessment), the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones (POAM).
31
  Organizations may choose to develop an assessment summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a
security control assessment. An assessment summary can provide an authorizing official with an abbreviated version a

•      Select the appropriate assessment procedures to be used during the assessment based on the
       security controls and control enhancements that are to be included in the assessment;
•      Tailor the selected assessment procedures for the information system impact level and
       organization’s operating environment;
•      Develop additional assessment procedures, if necessary, to address security controls and
       control enhancements that are not contained in NIST Special Publication 800-53 or to address
       additional assurance needs beyond what is provided in NIST Special Publication 800-53A;
•      Develop a strategy to apply the extended assessment procedure;
•      Optimize the assessment procedures to reduce duplication of effort and provide cost-effective
       assessment solutions; 32 and
•      Finalize the assessment plan and obtain the necessary approvals to execute the plan.

3.2.1 Determine which security controls are to be assessed.
The security plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the information system
and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
assessor starts with the security controls described in the security plan and considers the purpose
of the assessment. A security control assessment can be a complete assessment of all security
controls in the information system (e.g., during security certification as part of a certification and
accreditation process) or a partial assessment of the security controls in the information system
(e.g., during continuous monitoring, post accreditation, where subsets of the controls in the
information system are assessed on an ongoing basis). For partial assessments, the information
system owner collaborates with organizational officials having an interest in the assessment (e.g.,
senior agency information security officer, mission/information owners, inspectors general, and
authorizing official) to determine which security controls from the security plan are to be
assessed. The selection of the security controls depends on the continuous monitoring schedule
established by the information system owner to ensure that all controls are assessed during the
three-year accreditation cycle, items on the plan of action and milestones receive adequate
oversight, and controls with greater volatility are assessed more frequently. 33

3.2.2 Select appropriate procedures to assess the security controls.
NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Appendix F, provides an assessment procedure for each
security control and control enhancement in NIST Special Publication 800-53. For each security
control and control enhancement in the security plan to be included in the assessment, assessors
select the corresponding assessment procedure from Appendix F. The set of selected assessment
procedures varies from assessment to assessment based on the current content of the security plan
and the purpose of the security assessment (e.g., annual security control assessment, security
certification, continuous monitoring). Appendix H provides a work sheet for selecting the
appropriate assessment procedures for the assessment based on the approved security plan and the
particular assessment focus.




32
     Section 3.2.7 provides guidance on optimizing assessment procedures.
33
  NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides further information on selecting security controls in an information
system to be assessed as part of a continuous monitoring process. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance
on continuous monitoring as part of the security certification and accreditation process.

3.2.3 Tailor assessment procedures for specific operating environments.
In a similar manner to how the security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53 are
tailored for the organization’s mission, business functions, characteristics of the information
system and operating environment, the assessment procedures listed in Appendix F are tailored to
meet specific organizational needs.
Assessment procedures can be tailored by:
•      Selecting the assessment methods and objects needed to most cost-effectively make
       appropriate determinations and to satisfy assessment objectives;
•      Selecting the assessment method depth and coverage attribute values necessary to meet the
       assessment expectations defined in Appendix E based upon the characteristics of the
       information system being assessed and the specific determinations to be made;
•      Eliminating assessment procedures for common security controls if those controls have been
       assessed by another documented assessment process;
•      Developing information system/platform-specific and organization-specific assessment
       procedure adaptations to successfully carry out the assessment of the security controls;
•      Incorporating assessment results from previous assessments where the results are deemed
       applicable; 34 and
•      Making appropriate adjustments in assessment procedures to be able to obtain the requisite
       assessment evidence from external providers.

Assessment method and object-related considerations—
It is recognized that organizations can specify, document, and configure their information systems
in a variety of ways and that the content and applicability of existing assessment evidence will
vary. This may result in the need to apply a variety of assessment methods to various assessment
objects to generate the assessment evidence needed to determine whether the security controls are
effective in their application. Therefore, the list of assessment methods and objects provided with
each assessment procedure is termed potential to reflect this need to be able to choose the
methods and objects most appropriate for a specific assessment. The assessment methods and
objects chosen are those deemed as necessary to produce the evidence needed to make the
determinations described in the determination statements. The potential methods and objects in
the assessment procedure are provided as a resource to assist in the selection of appropriate
methods and objects, and not with the intent to limit the selection. As such, assessors should use
their judgment in selecting from the potential assessment methods and the general list of
assessment objects (also known as the object list) associated with each selected method.
Assessors should select only those methods and objects that most cost-effectively contribute to
making the determinations associated with the assessment objective. 35 The measure of the
quality of the assessment results is based on the soundness of the rationale provided, not the
specific set of methods and objects applied. It will not be necessary, in most cases, to apply every
assessment method to every assessment object to obtain the desired assessment results. And for
specific assessments, it may be appropriate to employ a method not currently listed in the set of
potential methods or to not employ a method that is listed.


34
     See Section on Reuse of assessment evidence-related considerations on page 20.
35
   The selection of assessment methods and objects (including the number and type of assessment objects) can be a
significant factor in cost-effectively meeting the assessment objectives.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                     PAGE 18
Special Publication 800-53A                    Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


To assist assessors in determining when assessment methods should be applied, the assessment
procedures in the catalog in Appendix F contain a suggested application of the potential
assessment methods to a low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information system
assessment. This suggested application is provided by the designators (L), (M), and (H) respectively.
The designators are provided for each of the impact levels at which security controls or control
enhancements are likely to be employed based on anticipated common usage. 36 The designations
are intended to assist, not limit, assessors in the selection of the most cost-effective assessment
methods for a given assessment.

In addition to selecting appropriate assessment methods and objects, each assessment method
(i.e., examine, interview, and test) has associated depth and coverage attributes that are described
in Appendix D. The attribute values affect the extent, rigor, and intensity of the assessment
procedure executed by the assessor. The values are selected as necessary to meet the assessment
expectations described in Appendix E for a specific determination in a specific assessment. The
values for depth and coverage are determined by both the impact level of the information system
(which defines the overall assessment expectations) and by the specifics of the system and the
security control being assessed (which impacts the assessor actions needed to achieve the
assessment expectations). For example, in a low-impact system, as assessors carry out the
assessment procedures for the security controls in the security plan (including conducting
interviews with individuals, examining policies, procedures, and other documentation, and testing
portions of the system), the level of effort is likely to be guided by the attribute definitions in
Appendix D for generalized depth and representative coverage as the level of rigor most likely
needed to achieve the assessment expectations defined for a low-impact system.

Common security control-related considerations—
Assessors should note which security controls (or parts of controls) in the security plan are
designated as common controls. Since the assessment of common controls is the responsibility of
the organizational entity that developed and implemented the controls, the assessment procedures
in Appendix F used to assess these controls should incorporate assessment results from that
organizational entity. 37 Common controls may have been previously assessed as part of the
organization’s information security program, or there may be a separate plan to assess the
common controls. In either situation, the information system owner coordinates the assessment
of all security controls with appropriate organizational officials (e.g., chief information officer,
senior agency information security officer, mission/ information owners, authorizing official)
obtaining the results of common control assessments or, if the common controls have not been
assessed or are due to be reassessed, making the necessary arrangements to include or reference
the common control assessment results in the current assessment. 38

36
  In the absence of any suggested applicability designators for assessment methods, or in cases where a security
control or control enhancement is used at a lower impact level than commonly applied, assessors will need to determine
the appropriate applicability of the methods with regard to meeting the assessment expectations for the information
system under assessment.
37
   Common security controls support multiple information systems within the organization and the protection measures
provided by those controls are inherited by the individual systems under assessment. Therefore, the organization
should determine the FIPS 199 impact level associated with the designated common controls to ensure that both the
strength of the controls (i.e., security capability) and level of rigor and intensity of the control assessments are
commensurate with the impact level of the individual information systems inheriting those controls. In general, the
impact level associated with the organization’s common controls should support the highest impact level of any
individual information system within the organization relying on those controls.
38
   If assessment results are not currently available for the common controls, the assessment plans for the information
systems under assessment that depend on those controls should be duly noted. The assessments cannot be considered
complete until the assessment results for the common controls are made available to information system owners.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                     PAGE 19
Special Publication 800-53A                  Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Another consideration in assessing common security controls is that there are occasionally
system-specific aspects of a common control that are not covered by the organizational entities
responsible for the common aspects of the control. These types of security controls are referred
to as hybrid controls. For example, CP-2, the contingency planning security control, may be
deemed a hybrid control by the organization if there is a master contingency plan developed by
the organization for all organizational information systems. However, information system
owners are expected to adjust, tailor, or supplement the contingency plan as necessary, when
there are system-specific aspects of the plan that need to be defined for the particular system
where the control is employed. For each hybrid security control, assessors should include in the
assessment plan, the portions of the assessment procedures from Appendix F related to the parts
of the control that are system-specific to ensure that, along with the results from common control
assessments, all aspects of the security control are assessed.

Reuse of assessment evidence-related considerations—
Assessors should take advantage of existing security control assessment information to facilitate
more cost-effective assessments. The reuse of assessment results from previously accepted or
approved assessments of the information system should be considered in the body of evidence for
determining overall security control effectiveness. 39 The assessment procedures in Appendix F
are designed to compile evidence for determining if security controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security
requirements of the information system. When considering the reuse of previous assessment
results and the value of those results to the current assessment, assessors should determine: (i) the
credibility of the evidence; (ii) the appropriateness of previous analysis; and (iii) the applicability
of the evidence to current information system operating conditions. It may be necessary, in
certain situations, to supplement the previous assessment results under consideration for reuse
with additional assessment activities to fully address the assessment objectives. For example, if
an independent, third-party evaluation of an information technology product did not test a
particular configuration setting that is employed by the organization in an information system,
then the assessor may need to supplement the original test results with additional testing to cover
that configuration setting for the current information system environment. 40 The following items
should be considered in validating previous assessment results for reuse in current assessments:
•    Changing conditions associated with security controls over time.
     Security controls that were deemed effective during previous assessments may have become
     ineffective due to changing conditions within the information system or the surrounding
     environment. Thus, assessment results that were found to be previously acceptable may no
     longer provide credible evidence for determination of security control effectiveness, and a
     reassessment would be required. Applying previous assessment results to a current
     assessment requires the identification of any changes that have occurred since the previous
     assessment and the impact of these changes on the previous assessment results. For example,
     reusing previous assessment results that involved examining an organization’s security
     policies and procedures may be acceptable if it is determined that there have not been any
     significant changes to the identified policies and procedures. Reusing evidence and security
     control assessment results produced during the initial certification and accreditation of an

39
   Previously accepted or approved assessments include those assessments of common security controls that are
managed by the organization and support multiple information systems.
40
  It should be noted that information technology product assessments are based upon the assumption that the products
are properly and appropriately configured when installed in particular information systems in specific operational
environments. If not properly configured, the products may not perform in the manner verified during the assessment.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                  PAGE 20
Special Publication 800-53A                   Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


     information system will likely be a cost-effective method for supporting continuous
     monitoring activities and annual FISMA reporting when the related controls have not
     changed and there are adequate reasons for confidence in their continued application.
•    Acceptability of using previous assessments.
     The acceptability of using previous assessment results in a security control assessment should
     be coordinated with and approved by the users of the assessment results. It is essential that
     the information system owner collaborates with appropriate organizational officials (e.g.,
     chief information officer, senior agency information security officer, mission/information
     owners, authorizing official) in determining the acceptability of using previous assessment
     results. The decision to reuse assessment results should be documented in the security
     assessment plan and the final security assessment report and should be consistent with federal
     legislation, policies, directives, standards, and guidelines with respect to the security control
     assessments.
•    Amount of time that has transpired since previous assessments.
     In general, as the time period between current and previous assessments increases, the
     credibility/utility of the previous assessment results decreases. This is primarily due to the
     fact that the information system or the environment in which the information system operates
     is more likely to change with the passage of time, possibly invalidating the original
     conditions or assumptions on which the previous assessment was based.
•    Degree of independence of previous assessments.
     Assessor independence can be a critical factor in certain types of assessments, especially for
     information system at the moderate- and high-impact levels. The degree of independence
     required from assessment to assessment should be consistent. For example, it is not
     appropriate to reuse results from a previous self-assessment where no assessor independence
     was required, in a current assessment requiring a greater degree of independence.

External information system-related considerations
The assessment procedures in Appendix F need to be adjusted as appropriate to accommodate the
assessment of external information systems. 41 Because the organization does not always have
direct control over the security controls used in external information systems, or sufficient
visibility into the development, implementation, and assessment of those controls, alternative
assessment approaches may need to be applied, resulting in the need to tailor the assessment
procedures described in Appendix F. Where required assurances of agreed-upon security controls
for an information system are documented in contracts or service-level agreements, the assessor
should review these contracts or agreements and where appropriate, tailor the assessment
procedures to assess either the security controls or the security control assessment results
provided through these agreements. Additionally, assessors should take into account any
assessments that have been conducted, or are in the process of being conducted, for external
information systems that are relied upon with regard to protecting the information system under
assessment. Applicable information from these assessments, if deemed reliable, should be
incorporated into the security assessment report.


41
  An external information system is an information system or component of an information system that is outside of
the accreditation boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct
control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. NIST
Special Publications 800-39 and 800-53 provide additional guidance on external information systems and the effect of
employing security controls in those types of environments.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                   PAGE 21
Special Publication 800-53A            Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


System/platform and organization-related considerations—
The assessment procedures in NIST Special Publication 800-53A may be adapted to address
system/platform-specific or organization-specific dependencies. This situation arises frequently
in the assessment procedures associated with the security controls from the technical families in
NIST Special Publication 800-53 (i.e., access control, audit and accountability, identification and
authentication, system and communications protection). For example, an extension to the IA-2
control for identification and authentication of users might include an explicit examination of the
.rhosts file for UNIX systems since improper entries in that file can result in bypassing user
authentication. Recent test results may also be applicable to the current assessment if those test
methods provide a high degree of transparency (e.g., what was tested, when was it tested, how
was it tested). Standards-based testing protocols such as the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) provide an example of how organizations can help achieve this level of
transparency. Further, the SCAP checklists and test procedures are organized by NIST Special
Publication 800-53 controls to enable efficiency in assessing federal information systems.

3.2.4 Develop assessment procedures for organization-specific security controls.
Based on organizational policies, mission or business function requirements, and an assessment
of risk, organizations may choose to develop and implement additional (organization-specific)
security controls or control enhancements for their information systems that are beyond the scope
of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53. Such security controls are documented in the
security plan for the information system as controls not found in NIST Special Publication 800-
53. To assess the security controls in this situation, assessors should use the material described in
Chapter Two to develop assessment procedures for those controls and control enhancements. The
assessment procedures developed should be integrated into the security assessment plan.

3.2.5 Develop assessment procedures for additional assurance requirements.
The assessment procedures described in NIST Special Publication 800-53A correspond with the
minimum assurance requirements identified in NIST Special Publication 800-53. However, when
the organization is relying upon security controls to mitigate risks arising from highly skilled,
highly motivated, and well-financed threat sources, NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires
organizations obtain additional assurances for moderate-impact and high-impact information
systems. As indicated in the last row in Table E-1 in Appendix E, the assessment procedures for
these added assurances are beyond the scope of the minimum assessment expectations currently
described in this document. Therefore, when such additional assurances apply, the organization
should develop additional assessment procedures to provide the necessary evidence that the
effected security controls have been developed in a manner that supports a high degree of
confidence that the controls are complete, consistent, and implemented correctly. Additionally,
organizational risk management needs may dictate the development of assessment procedures
beyond the procedures provided in this publication. In both cases, the additional security control
assessment procedures should be integrated into the security assessment plan.

3.2.6 Develop strategy for incorporating extended assessment procedure.
Organizations have great flexibility in achieving the developer/implementer assurance
requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-53. For a requirement such as assurance that flaws
are addressed in a timely manner, the organization can satisfy this requirement on a control-by-
control basis, on a by-type-of-control basis, on a system-by-system basis, or perhaps even at the
organizational level. In consideration of this flexibility, the extended assessment procedure in
Appendix F is applied on an assessment-by-assessment basis typically according to how the
organization chose to achieve the associated NIST Special Publication 800-53 assurances for the


CHAPTER 3                                                                                            PAGE 22
Special Publication 800-53A                      Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


information system under assessment. The method of application should be documented in the
security assessment plan. Further, the organization selects the appropriate assessment objectives
from the extended assessment procedure based on the information system impact level. The
application of the extended assessment procedure is intended to supplement the other assessment
procedures to increase the grounds for confidence that the security controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the
security requirements of the information system.

3.2.7 Optimize selected assessment procedures to ensure maximum efficiency.
Assessors have a great deal of flexibility in organizing a security assessment plan that meets the
needs of the organization and that provides the best opportunity for obtaining the necessary
evidence to determine security control effectiveness, while reducing overall assessment costs.
Combining and consolidating assessment procedures is one area where this flexibility can be
applied. During the assessment of an information system, assessment methods are applied
numerous times to a variety of assessment objects within a particular family of security controls.
To save time, reduce assessment costs, and maximize the usefulness of assessment results,
assessors should review the selected assessment procedures for the security control families and
combine or consolidate the procedures (or parts of procedures) whenever possible or practicable.
For example, assessors may wish to consolidate interviews with key organizational officials
dealing with a variety of security-related topics. Assessors may have other opportunities for
significant consolidations and cost savings by examining all security policies and procedures
from the seventeen families of security controls at the same time or organizing groups of related
policies and procedures that could be examined as a unified entity. Obtaining and examining
configuration settings from similar hardware and software components within the information
system is another example that can provide significant assessment efficiencies.

An additional area for consideration in optimizing the assessment process is the sequence in
which security controls are assessed. The assessment of some security controls before others may
provide information that facilitates understanding and assessment of other controls. For example,
security controls such as CM-2 (Baseline Configuration), CM-8 (Information System Component
Inventory), PL-2 (System Security Plan), RA-2 (Security Categorization), and RA-3 (Risk
Assessment) produce general descriptions of the information system. Assessing these security
controls early in the assessment process may provide a basic understanding of the information
system that can aid in assessing other security controls. The supplemental guidance of many
security controls also identifies related controls that can provide useful information in organizing
the assessment procedures. 42 For example, AC-19 (Access Control for Portable and Mobile
Devices) lists security controls MP-4 (Media Storage) and MP-5 (Media Transport) as being
related to AC-19. Since AC-19 is related to MP-4 and MP-5, the sequence in which assessments
are conducted for AC-19, MP-4, and MP-5 may facilitate the reuse of assessment information
from one control in assessing other related controls.

3.2.8 Finalize security assessment plan and obtain approval to execute plan.
After selecting the assessment procedures (including developing necessary procedures not
contained in the NIST Special Publication 800-53A catalog of procedures), tailoring the
procedures for information system/platform-specific and organization-specific conditions,
optimizing the procedures for efficiency, applying the extended assessment procedure, and
addressing the potential for unexpected events impacting the assessment, the assessment plan is
finalized and the schedule is established including key milestones for the assessment process.

42
     Security control assessment sequencing is also addressed in the assessment cases described in Appendix J.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                        PAGE 23
Special Publication 800-53A                    Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Once the security assessment plan is completed, the plan is reviewed and approved by appropriate
organizational officials 43 to ensure that the plan is complete, consistent with the security
objectives of the organization and the organization’s assessment of risk, and cost-effective with
regard to the resources allocated for the assessment.

3.3 CONDUCTING SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
After the security assessment plan is approved by the organization, the assessor or assessment
team 44 executes the plan in accordance with the agreed-upon milestones and schedule.
Assessment objectives are achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to selected
assessment objects and compiling/producing the information necessary to make the determination
associated with each assessment objective. Each determination statement contained within an
assessment procedure executed by an assessor produces one the following findings: (i) satisfied
(S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). A finding of satisfied indicates that for the portion of the
security control addressed by the determination statement, the assessment information obtained
(i.e., evidence collected) indicates that the assessment objective for the control has been met
producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied indicates that for the portion
of the security control addressed by the determination statement, the assessment information
obtained indicates potential anomalies in the operation or implementation of the control that may
need to be addressed by the organization. 45 A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that
for reasons specified in the assessment report, the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient
information to make the particular determination called for in the determination statement.

The assessor findings (i.e., the determinations made) should be an unbiased, factual reporting of
what was found concerning the security control assessed. For each finding of other than satisfied,
assessors should indicate which parts of the security control are affected by the finding (i.e., those
aspects of the control that were deemed not satisfied or were not able to be assessed) and describe
how the control differs from the planned or expected state. The potential for compromises to
confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to other than satisfied findings should also be noted
by the assessor.

Security control assessment results should be documented at the level of detail appropriate for the
assessment in accordance with the reporting format prescribed by organizational policy, NIST
guidelines, and OMB policy. The reporting format should also be appropriate for the type of
security control assessment conducted (e.g., self-assessments by information system owners,
independent verification and validation, independent assessments by assessors or assessment
teams supporting the security accreditation process, or independent audits of security controls by
auditors or inspectors general). A sample reporting format for security control assessments is
provided in Appendix I. The sample reporting format is illustrative and not intended to limit
organizational flexibility in determining the most appropriate presentation for the purposes of a
given security control assessment.

43
   Organizations should establish a security assessment plan approval process with the specific organizational officials
(e.g., information systems owners, information system security officers, senior agency information security officers,
authorizing officials) designated as approving authorities for the security plan of the information system being assessed.
44
  Determining the size and organizational makeup of the security assessment team (i.e., skill sets, technical expertise,
and assessment experience of the individuals composing the team) is part of the risk management decisions made by
the organization requesting and initiating the assessment of the information system.
45
   For assessment findings that are other than satisfied, organizations may choose to define subcategories of findings
indicating the severity/criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered and the potential adverse effects on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Defining such subcategories of
findings can help to establish priorities for needed risk mitigation actions.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                      PAGE 24
Special Publication 800-53A                    Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


The information system owner relies on the security expertise and the technical judgment of the
assessor to: (i) assess the security controls in the information system; and (ii) provide specific
recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and reduce or
eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The assessment information produced by the assessor (i.e.,
findings of satisfied or other than satisfied, identification of the parts of the security control that
did not produce a satisfactory result, and a description of resulting potential for compromises to
the information system) is provided to the information system owner in the initial (draft) security
assessment report. The system owner may choose to act on selected recommendations of the
assessor before the security assessment report is finalized if there are specific opportunities to
correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the security controls or to correct/clarify misunderstandings
or interpretations of assessment results. 46 Security controls modified, enhanced, or added during
this process should be reassessed by the assessor prior to the production of the final security
assessment report. The delivery of the final assessment report to the information system owner
marks the official end of the security control assessment.

3.4 ANALYZING SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT RESULTS
Since results of the security control assessment ultimately influence the content of the security
plan and the plan of action and milestones, the information system owner reviews the findings of
the assessor and with the concurrence of designated organizational officials (e.g., authorizing
official, chief information officer, senior agency information security officer, mission/information
owners), determines the appropriate steps required to correct weaknesses and deficiencies
identified during the assessment. By using the tags of satisfied and other than satisfied, the
reporting format for the assessment findings provides visibility for organizational officials into
specific weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system and facilitates a disciplined and
structured approach to mitigating risks in accordance with organizational priorities. For example,
the information system owner in consultation with designated organizational officials may decide
that certain assessment findings marked as other than satisfied are of an inconsequential nature
and present no significant risk to the organization. Alternatively, the system owner and
organizational officials may decide that certain findings marked as other than satisfied are
significant, requiring immediate remediation actions. In all cases, the organization reviews each
assessor finding of other than satisfied and applies its judgment with regard to the severity or
seriousness of the finding (i.e., the potential adverse affect on the organization’s operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation), and whether the finding is significant
enough to be worthy of further investigation or remedial action.

Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that
the organization’s resources are effectively allocated in accordance with organizational priorities,
providing resources first to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and
sensitive missions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest degree
of risk. Ultimately, the assessment findings and any subsequent mitigation actions initiated by
the information system owner in collaboration with designated organizational officials trigger
updates to the risk assessment and the security plan. Therefore, the key documents used by the
authorizing official to determine the security status of the information system (i.e., security plan
with updated risk assessment, security assessment report, and plan of actions and milestones) are
updated to reflect the results of the security control assessment.

46
   The correction of deficiencies in security controls or carrying out of selected assessor recommendations during the
information system owner’s review of the initial (draft) security assessment report is not intended to replace the formal
risk mitigation process by the organization which occurs after the delivery and acceptance of the final report. Rather, it
provides the information system owner with an opportunity to address problems or deficiencies that may be quickly
corrected.

        800-53A. The terms in the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of
        FISMA-related security standards and guidelines developed by NIST. Unless otherwise
stated, all terms used in this publication are also consistent with the definitions contained in the
CNSS Instruction 4009, National Information Assurance Glossary.

 Accreditation                          The official management decision given by a senior
 [FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-37]             agency official to authorize operation of an information
                                        system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency
                                        operations (including mission, functions, image, or
                                        reputation), agency assets, or individuals, based on the
                                        implementation of an agreed-upon set of security
                                        controls.
 Accreditation Boundary                 All components of an information system to be accredited

        his appendix provides complete definitions of the three assessment methods that can be
        used by assessors during security control assessments: (i) examine; (ii) interview; and (iii)
        test. The definitions include a set of attributes and attribute values for each of the
assessment methods. The attribute values for the assessment methods (which describe the rigor
and level of detail associated with the assessment) are hierarchical in nature. For the depth
attribute, the focused attribute value includes and builds upon the assessment rigor and level of
detail defined for the generalized attribute value; the detailed attribute value includes and builds
upon the assessment rigor and level of detail defined for the focused attribute value. For the
coverage attribute, the specific attribute value includes and builds upon the number and type of
assessment objects defined for the representative attribute value; the comprehensive attribute
value includes and builds upon the number and type of assessment objects defined for the specific
attribute value. The use of bolded text in the assessment method descriptions indicates the
content that was added to the attribute value descriptions and appears for the first time.

                              Mechanisms (e.g., functionality implemented in hardware, software, firmware)
                              Activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises)
DEFINITION: The process of checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more
assessment objects to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence, the results of which
are used to support the determination of security control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness,
and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example: reviewing information
security policies, plans, and procedures; analyzing system design documentation and interface
specifications; observing system backup operations, reviewing the results of contingency plan exercises;
observing incident response activities; studying technical manuals and user/administrator guides; checking,
studying, or observing the operation of an information technology mechanism in the information system
hardware/software; or checking, studying, or observing physical security measures related to the operation
of an information system.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the examination process. There are
     three possible values for the depth attribute: (i) generalized; (ii) focused; and (iii) detailed.
     -    Generalized examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or
          inspections of the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a limited body of evidence
          or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions for
          activities; and actual documents for specifications). Generalized examinations provide a level of
          understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free
          of obvious errors.
     -    Focused examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections
          and more in depth studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type of examination is conducted using a
          substantial body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level descriptions and where appropriate
          and available, high-level design information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
          implementation procedures for activities; and the actual documents and related documents for
          specifications). Focused examinations provide a level of understanding of the security control necessary for
          determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased
          grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended.
     -    Detailed examination: Examination that consists of high-level reviews, checks, observations, or inspections
          and more in depth, detailed, and thorough studies/analyses of the assessment object. This type of
          examination is conducted using an extensive body of evidence or documentation (e.g., functional-level
          descriptions and where appropriate and available, high-level design information, low-level design
          information, and implementation information for mechanisms; high-level process descriptions and
          detailed implementation procedures for activities; and the actual documents and related documents for
          specifications 48 ). Detailed examinations provide a level of understanding of the security control necessary
          for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further
          increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended on an
          ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness
          of the control.
•    The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the examination process and includes the
     types of assessment objects to be examined, the number of objects to be examined (by type), and
     specific objects to be examined. 49 There are three possible values for the coverage attribute: (i)
     representative, (ii) specific, and (iii) comprehensive.

48
   While additional documentation is likely for mechanisms when moving from generalized to focused to detailed
examinations, the documentation used with regard to specifications and activities may be the same for focused and
detailed examinations, with the rigor of the examinations of these documents being increased at the detailed level.
49
  The organization, considering a variety of factors (e.g., available resources, importance of the assessment, the
organization’s overall assessment goals and objectives), confers with assessors and provides direction on the type,
number, and specific objects to be examined for the particular attribute value described.

         and number within type) to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security
         control is implemented and free of obvious errors.
    -    Specific examination: Examination that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type and

         type and number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed particularly important to
         achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the
         security control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds
         for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and
         consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the
         control.

ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Individuals or groups of individuals.
DEFINITION: The process of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an organization to
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or lead to the location of evidence, the results of which are
used to support the determination of security control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness,
and potential for improvement over time.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example, interviewing agency
heads, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials,
information owners, information system and mission owners, information system security officers,
information system security managers, personnel officers, human resource managers, facilities managers,
training officers, information system operators, network and system administrators, site managers, physical
security officers, and users.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the rigor of and level of detail in the interview process. There are three
     possible values for the depth attribute: (i) generalized; (ii) focused; and (iii) detailed.
     -    Generalized interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions with individuals or
          groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions.
          Generalized interviews provide a level of understanding of the security control necessary for determining
          whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more in depth
          discussions in specific areas with individuals or groups of individuals. This type of interview is conducted
          using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in depth questions in specific areas where
          responses indicate a need for more in depth investigation. Focused interviews provide a level of
          understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free
          of obvious errors and whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the control is
          implemented correctly and operating as intended.
     -    Detailed interview: Interview that consists of broad-based, high-level discussions and more in depth, probing
          discussions in specific areas (including other assessment results) with individuals or groups of individuals.
          This type of interview is conducted using a set of generalized, high-level questions and more in depth,
          probing questions in specific areas where responses indicate a need for more in depth investigation or where
          called for by assessment procedures. Detailed interviews provide a level of understanding of the security
          control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether
          there are further increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as
          intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in
          the effectiveness of the control.

     of individuals to be interviewed (by organizational role and associated responsibility), the number of
     individuals to be interviewed (by type), and specific individuals to be interviewed. 50 There are three
     possible values for the coverage attribute: (i) representative, (ii) specific, and (iii) comprehensive.

          roles to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the security control is implemented
          and free of obvious errors.
     -    Specific interview: Interview that uses a representative sample of individuals in key organizational roles and

ASSESSMENT METHOD:            Test
ASSESSMENT OBJECTS:           Mechanisms (e.g., hardware, software, firmware)
                              Activities (e.g., system operations, administration, management; exercises)
DEFINITION: The process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified conditions to
compare actual with expected behavior, the results of which are used to support the determination of
security control existence, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for improvement over
time. 51
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE: Typical assessor actions may include, for example: testing access control,
identification and authentication, and audit mechanisms; testing security configuration settings; testing
physical access control devices; conducting penetration testing of key information system components;
testing information system backup operations; testing incident response capability; and exercising
contingency planning capability.
ATTRIBUTES: Depth, Coverage

•    The depth attribute addresses the types of testing to be conducted. There are three possible values for
     the depth attribute: (i) generalized testing; (ii) focused testing; and (iii) detailed testing.
     -    Generalized testing: Test methodology (also known as black box testing) that assumes no knowledge of the
          internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using
          a functional specification for mechanisms and a high-level process description for activities. Generalized
          testing provides a level of understanding of the security control necessary for determining whether the control
          is implemented and free of obvious errors.
     -    Focused testing: Test methodology (also known as gray box testing) that assumes some knowledge of the
          internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using
          a functional specification and limited system architectural information (e.g., high-level design) for
          mechanisms and a high-level process description and high-level description of integration into the
          operational environment for activities. Focused testing provides a level of understanding of the security
          control necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and
          whether there are increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and
          operating as intended.
     -    Detailed testing: Test methodology (also known as white box testing) that assumes explicit and substantial
          knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type of testing
          is conducted using a functional specification, extensive system architectural information (e.g., high-level
          design, low-level design) and implementation representation (e.g., source code, schematics) for
          mechanisms and a high-level process description and detailed description of integration into the operational
          environment for activities. Detailed testing provides a level of understanding of the security control
          necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there
          are further increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as
          intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in
          the effectiveness of the control.

•    The coverage attribute addresses the scope or breadth of the testing process and includes the types of
     assessment objects to be tested, the number of objects to be tested (by type), and specific objects to be
     tested. 52 There are three possible values for the coverage attribute: (i) representative; (ii) specific; and
     (iii) comprehensive.

51
   Testing is typically used to determine if mechanisms or activities meet a set of predefined specifications. Testing can
also be performed to determine characteristics of a security control that are not commonly associated with predefined
specifications, with an example of such testing being penetration testing. Guidelines for conducting penetration testing
are provided in Appendix G.
52
  The organization, considering a variety of factors (e.g., available resources, importance of the assessment, the
organization’s overall assessment goals and objectives), confers with assessors and provides direction on the type,
number, and specific objects to be tested for the particular attribute value described. For mechanism-related testing, the
coverage attribute also addresses the extent of the testing conducted (e.g., for software, the number of test cases and
modules tested; for hardware, the range of inputs, number of components tested, and range of environmental factors
over which the testing is conducted).

APPENDIX E

ASSESSMENT EXPECTATIONS
EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS BY IMPACT LEVEL




T        he following section establishes the expectations for security control assessments based on
         the assurance requirements defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53. The assessment
         expectations provide assessors with important reference points for the level of assurance
(i.e., grounds for confidence) needed for the determination of security control effectiveness. The
use of bolded text in the assurance requirements and assessment objectives in this section
indicates additions to the requirements and objectives that appear for the first time at a particular
information system impact level.

LOW-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in low-impact information systems, the focus is on the controls
being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are discovered, they are
addressed in a timely manner.
Assessment Expectations: Interviews, examinations, and tests are conducted at a level of depth and coverage
sufficient to demonstrate that the security control is implemented and free of obvious errors. 53
Assessment Objectives:
For specifications:
-    Determine if the specification exists.
-    Determine if the specification, as written, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious internal errors.
For mechanisms:
-    Determine if the mechanism is implemented and operational.
-    Determine if the mechanism, as implemented, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious implementation errors.
For activities:
-    Determine if the activity is being performed.
-    Determine if the activity, as performed, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious execution errors.




53
   To define an appropriate level of rigor and intensity for low-impact information system assessments sufficient to
achieve the stated assessment expectations, organizations should consider starting with depth and coverage attribute
values of generalized and representative, respectively, for assessment methods employed (see Appendix D).



APPENDIX E                                                                                                        PAGE E-1

________________________________________________________________________________________________


MODERATE-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the control.
The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned
responsibilities and specific actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is
implemented, it will meet its required function or purpose. These actions include, for example,
requiring the development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this
determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in moderate-impact information systems, the focus is on
actions supporting increased confidence in the correct implementation and operation of the control. While
flaws are still likely to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer/implementer
incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities and produces specific documentation supporting
increased confidence that the control meets its required function or purpose. This documentation is also
needed by assessors to analyze and test the functional properties of the control as part of the overall
assessment of the control.
Assessment Expectations: Interviews, examinations, and tests are conducted at a level of depth and coverage
sufficient to demonstrate that the security control is implemented and free of obvious errors, and that there
are increased grounds for confidence that the security control is implemented correctly and
operating as intended. 54
Assessment Objectives:
For specifications:
-    Determine if the specification exists.
-    Determine if the specification, as written, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious internal errors.
-    Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
     documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the specification is complete, internally
     consistent, correct, and meets its required function or purpose.
-    Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the application or use of
     the specification.
For mechanisms:
-    Determine if the mechanism is implemented and operational.
-    Determine if the mechanism, as implemented, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious implementation errors.
-    Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
     documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the mechanism is implemented correctly,
     operating as intended, and meets its required function or purpose.
-    Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the implementation or
     operation of the mechanism.
For activities:
-    Determine if the activity is being performed.
-    Determine if the activity, as performed, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious execution errors.
-    Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
     documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the activity is being performed correctly
     and meets its required function or purpose.
-    Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the conduct or
     execution of the activity.


54
   To define an appropriate level of rigor and intensity for moderate-impact information system assessments sufficient
to achieve the stated assessment expectations, organizations should consider a range of depth and coverage attribute
values for assessment methods employed (see Appendix D) up to and including focused and specific, respectively.



APPENDIX E                                                                                                        PAGE E-2

HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis
and testing of the control (including functional interfaces among control components). The control
developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned responsibilities and specific
actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and
consistently (i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support
improvement in the effectiveness of the control. These actions include, for example, requiring the
development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in high-impact information systems, the focus is expanded to
require, within the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the
control and continuous improvement in the control’s effectiveness. The developer/implementer is expected
to expend significant effort on the design, development, implementation, and component/integration testing
of the controls and to produce associated design and implementation documentation to support these
activities. This documentation is also needed by assessors to analyze and test the internal components of
the control as part of the overall assessment of the control.
Assessment Expectations: Interviews, examinations, and tests are conducted at a level of depth and coverage
sufficient to demonstrate that the security control is implemented and free of obvious errors and that there
are further increased grounds for confidence that the security control is implemented correctly and
operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous
improvement in the effectiveness of the control. 55
Assessment Objectives:
For specifications:
-    Determine if the specification exists.
-    Determine if the specification, as written, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious internal errors.
-    Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
     documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the specification is complete, internally consistent,
     correct, and meets its required function or purpose.
-    Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the application or use of the
     specification.
-    Determine if the organization applies the specification consistently across the information system.
-    Determine if the organization supports improvement in the effectiveness of the specification by taking
     specific actions to correct identified deficiencies.
For mechanisms:
-    Determine if the mechanism is implemented and operational.
-    Determine if the mechanism, as implemented, has no obvious inconsistencies with the functional requirements in the
     security control and no obvious implementation errors.
-    Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
     documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the mechanism is implemented correctly, operating
     as intended, and meets its required function or purpose.
-    Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the implementation or operation
     of the mechanism.
-    Determine if the organization implements the mechanism consistently across the information system.




55
  To define an appropriate level of rigor and intensity for high-impact information system assessments sufficient to
achieve the stated assessment expectations, organizations should consider a range of depth and coverage attribute
values for assessment methods employed (see Appendix D) up to and including detailed and comprehensive,
respectively.

-      Determine if the organization provides an assignment of responsibilities, specific actions, and appropriate
       documentation to support increased grounds for confidence that the activity is being performed correctly and meets
       its required function or purpose.
-      Determine if the organization identifies and documents anomalies or problems with the conduct or execution of the
       activity.
-      Determine if the organization performs the activity consistently across the information system.
-      Determine if the organization supports improvement in the effectiveness of the activity by taking specific
       actions to correct identified deficiencies.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPLEMENT MODERATE- AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
testing of the control. The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, actions
supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently
(i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the
effectiveness of the control. These actions include requiring the development of records with structure and
content suitable to facilitate making this determination. The control is developed in a manner that
supports a high degree of confidence that the control is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: The additional high assurance requirements are intended to supplement the
minimum assurance requirements for the moderate and high baselines, when appropriate, in order to protect
against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of
protection is necessary for those information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the
risks associated with the type of threat agents cited above.

and high-impact information systems.

APPENDIX F

ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE CATALOG
OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND OBJECTS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY CONTROLS




T       his appendix provides a catalog of procedures to assess the security controls and control
        enhancements in NIST Special Publication 800-53. 56 The assessment procedures listed in
        Section I, are aligned with the security control catalog in Special Publication 800-53.
Assessors should select the appropriate assessment procedures from the catalog in this appendix
for the security controls and control enhancements included in the security plan that are to be
assessed in a particular assessment. Since the contents of the security plan affect the development
of the security assessment plan and the assessment, there will likely be assessment procedures in
the catalog that assessors will not use because: (i) the associated security controls or control
enhancements are not contained in the security plan for the information system; 57 or (ii) the
security controls or control enhancements are not being assessed at this particular time (e.g.,
during an assessment of a subset of the controls as part of continuous monitoring activities).

In addition to the assessment procedures provided for security controls and control enhancements,
the catalog also contains an extended assessment procedure in Section II that is employed by
assessors to obtain additional assurance-related evidence to support the grounds for confidence
that the security controls are effective in their application. The extended assessment procedure,
which follows the assessment procedures in the catalog, can be applied by the organization in a
variety of ways depending on how the information system security controls are developed and
implemented, and how the organization manages its security control assessment processes.
Section 3.3 of this document provides guidance on the application of the extended assessment
procedure.

Each assessment procedure consists of one or more assessment objectives, which are used in
assessing particular aspects of a security control or control enhancement (or in the case of the
extended assessment procedure, aspects of the security control, control enhancement, family of
controls, or security controls employed across the organization). Each assessment objective in an
assessment procedure contains a unique identifier. For example, CP-3.2 indicates that this is the
second assessment objective for security control CP-3. CP-4(2).1 indicates that this is the first
assessment objective for the second enhancement for security control CP-4. The extended
assessment objectives are numbered sequentially (i.e., EAP.1, EAP.2, EAP.3, EAP.4, EAP.5) and
are employed based upon the impact level of the information system.




56
   For ease of use and quick reference, a description of the security controls and control enhancements from NIST
Special Publication 800-53 (as amended) is provided in the shaded grey areas at the beginning of the assessment
procedures. In the event of any differences between this description and the most recent version of NIST Special
Publication 800-53, Special Publication 800-53 remains the definitive expression of the control or enhancement.
57
   The execution of the Risk Management Framework includes the selection of an initial set of baseline security
controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems followed by a security control
tailoring and supplementation process. The tailoring and supplementation process will likely change the set of security
controls that will be contained in the final, agreed upon, security plan for the information system. Therefore, the
selection of assessment procedures from the catalog of available procedures should be based solely on the content of
the security plan after the tailoring and supplementation activities are completed.



APPENDIX F                                                                                                   PAGE F-1

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Assessors should select appropriate assessment methods from the potential assessment methods
listed in the assessment procedures for security controls and control enhancements. Appropriate
assessment methods are those methods that will most likely produce the evidence needed by
assessors to make the determinations necessary to satisfy the specified assessment objectives. 58 It
is also important to determine when those methods should be applied with regard to the impact
level of the information system being assessed. To assist assessors in making this determination,
the assessment procedures in the catalog in Appendix F include a suggested application of the
potential assessment methods to a low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information
system assessment provided by the designators (L), (M), and (H) respectively. These designations are
intended to assist, not limit, assessors in the selection of the most cost-effective assessment
methods for the assessment. The designators are provided for each of the impact levels at which
security controls/control enhancements are likely to be employed based on anticipated common
usage. 59

It should also be noted that the same assessment object may appear in multiple object lists in a
variety of assessment procedures. The same object may be used in multiple contexts to obtain
needed information or evidence for a particular aspect of an assessment. Assessors should use the
general reference as appropriate to obtain the necessary information to make the specified
determinations required by the assessment objective. For example, a reference to access control
policy appears in the assessment procedures for AC-2 and AC-7. For assessment procedure AC-
2, assessors use the access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that
addresses account management for the information system. For assessment procedure AC-7,
assessors use the access control policy to find information about that portion of the policy that
addresses unsuccessful login attempts for the information system.




58
     See Section 3.2.3 on tailoring assessment procedures for specific operating environments.
59
   The lack of an L, M, or H designation in the assessment procedure catalog does not mean the assessment method is
not applied at that level or that the security control or control enhancement is not used in a system at that level. Rather,
since the control or enhancement was not in the original security control baseline in NIST Special Publication 800-53
(i.e., anticipated common usage), a recommendation for applicability of the potential assessment methods to that
impact level was simply not provided. In the absence of any suggested applicability designators for assessment
methods or in cases where a control or enhancement is employed at a lower impact level than that commonly applied,
assessors will need to determine the appropriate applicability of the methods with regard to meeting the assessment
expectations for the information system under assessment.

                                                Implementation Tips
 TIP #1: Select only those assessment procedures from Appendix F that correspond to the security
 controls and control enhancements in the approved security plan and that are to be included in the
 assessment.

 TIP #2: The assessment procedures selected from Appendix F are simply exemplary procedures.
 These procedures should be reviewed and appropriately tailored and supplemented as necessary, in
 accordance with the guidance in Section 3.3 to adapt the procedures to specific organizational
 requirements and operating environments.

 TIP #3: The assessor applies to each method, the values for depth and coverage that are
 commensurate with the impact level of the information system and the specifics of the determination to
 be made. The values selected for the depth and coverage attributes indicate how much effort is applied
 to the assessment (i.e., the rigor, level of intensity, and scope of the activities associated with the
 assessment).

 TIP #4: With respect to the assessment procedures in Appendix F, assessors need apply only those
 procedures, methods, and objects necessary for making a final determination that a particular security
 control objective is satisfied or not satisfied (see Section 3.4).


 Note #1: NIST Special Publication 800-53A is a companion publication to NIST Special Publication 800-53, not a
 replacement or update. Special Publication 800-53 remains the definitive NIST recommendation for employing
 security controls in federal information systems.
 Note #2: When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, inspector generals, evaluators, and/or
 assessors should consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the particular guidance
 document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission responsibilities, operational
 environments, and unique organizational conditions.

  Whereas a set of potential assessment methods have been included in the following catalog of
  assessment procedures, these are not intended to be mandatory or exclusive and, depending on
  the particular circumstances of the information system to be assessed, not all methods may be
  required or other assessment methods may also be used. Additionally, the potential assessment
  objects listed are not intended to be a mandatory set, but rather a set from which the necessary
  and sufficient set of objects for a given assessment can be selected to make the appropriate
  determinations.

 AC-1             ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                  Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a
                  formal, documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                  and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation
                  of the access control policy and associated access controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The access control policy and procedures are consistent with
                  applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                  guidance. The access control policy can be included as part of the general information
                  security policy for the organization. Access control procedures can be developed for the
                  security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required.
                  NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.

 AC-1.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization develops and documents access control policy and procedures;
                  (ii) the organization disseminates access control policy and procedures to appropriate
                        elements within the organization;
                  (iii) responsible parties within the organization periodically review access control policy
                        and procedures; and
                  (iv) the organization updates access control policy and procedures when organizational
                        review indicates updates are required.

 AC-2             ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

                  Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including establishing,
                  activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. The organization
                  reviews information system accounts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at
                  least annually].
                  Supplemental Guidance: Account management includes the identification of account types
                  (i.e., individual, group, and system), establishment of conditions for group membership,
                  and assignment of associated authorizations. The organization identifies authorized users
                  of the information system and specifies access rights/privileges. The organization grants
                  access to the information system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is
                  determined by assigned official duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria; and
                  (ii) intended system usage. The organization requires proper identification for requests to
                  establish information system accounts and approves all such requests. The organization
                  specifically authorizes and monitors the use of guest/anonymous accounts and removes,
                  disables, or otherwise secures unnecessary accounts. Account managers are notified
                  when information system users are terminated or transferred and associated accounts are
                  removed, disabled, or otherwise secured. Account managers are also notified when users’
                  information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes.

 AC-2.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization manages information system accounts, including authorizing,
                        establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts;
                  (ii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        frequency of information system account reviews and the frequency is at least
                        annually;
                  (iii) the organization reviews information system accounts in accordance with
                        organization-defined frequency; and
                  (iv) the organization initiates required actions on information system accounts based on
                        the review.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account management;
                           security plan; list of active system accounts along with the name of the individual
                           associated with each account; lists of recently transferred, separated, or terminated
                           employees; list of recently disabled information system accounts along with the name of
                           the individual associated with each account; system-generated records with user IDs and
                           last login date; other relevant documents or records]. (L) (M) (H)

 AC-2(1)          ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
                  system accounts.

                  [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].

 AC-2(2).1        ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, a time
                       period for each type of account after which the information system terminates
                       temporary and emergency accounts; and
                  (ii) the information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts
                       after organization-defined time period for each type of account.

 AC-3             ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

                  Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to
                  the system in accordance with applicable policy.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based
                  policies, rule-based policies) and associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access
                  control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to
                  control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g.,
                  devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In
                  addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement
                  mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased
                  information security for the organization. Consideration is given to the implementation
                  of a controlled, audited, and manual override of automated mechanisms in the event of
                  emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed as
                  an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended)
                  compliant. Related security control: SC-13.

 AC-3(1)          ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The information system restricts access to privileged functions (deployed in hardware,
                  software, and firmware) and security-relevant information to explicitly authorized personnel.

                  Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Explicitly authorized personnel include, for
                  example, security administrators, system and network administrators, and other
                  privileged users. Privileged users are individuals who have access to system control,
                  monitoring, or administration functions (e.g., system administrators, information system
                  security officers, maintainers, system programmers).

                  privileged functions that have impacts on facility, public, and environmental safety.

                  ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization does not employ dual-approval
                  mechanisms when an immediate response is necessary to ensure public and
                  environmental safety.

 AC-4             INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

                  Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow
                  of information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with
                  applicable policy.
                  Supplemental Guidance:    Information flow control regulates where information is allowed
                  to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to
                  who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent
                  accesses to that information. A few, of many, generalized examples of possible
                  restrictions that are better expressed as flow control than access control are: keeping
                  export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking
                  outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and not passing any web
                  requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control
                  policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to
                  control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g.,
                  networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected
                  systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the
                  information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in
                  boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls,
                  and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict
                  information system services or provide a packet filtering capability. Related security
                  control: SC-7.

 AC-5             SEPARATION OF DUTIES

                  Control: The information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access
                  authorizations.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility
                  and separates duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and
                  duties of individuals. There is access control software on the information system that
                  prevents users from having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform
                  fraudulent activity without collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i)
                  mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among
                  different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform information system support
                  functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, quality assurance/testing,
                  configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security personnel who
                  administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.

 AC-5.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility and separates
                       duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and duties of
                       individuals; and
                  (ii) the information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access
                       authorizations.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:

 AC-6             LEAST PRIVILEGE

                  Control: The information system enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or
                  accesses needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of
                  specified tasks.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs the concept of least privilege for
                  specific duties and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services)
                  in accordance with risk assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to
                  organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.

 AC-6.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization assigns the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses
                       needed by users for the performance of specified tasks; and
                  (ii) the information system enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or

 AC-7             UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

                  Control: The information system enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined
                  number] consecutive invalid access attempts by a user during a [Assignment:
                  organization-defined time period] time period. The information system automatically
                  [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period],
                  delays next login prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay
                  algorithm.]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts
                  initiated by the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after
                  a predetermined time period established by the organization.

 AC-7.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        maximum number of consecutive invalid access attempts to the information system
                        by a user and the time period in which the consecutive invalid access attempts
                        occur;
                  (ii) the information system enforces the organization-defined limit of consecutive invalid
                        access attempts by a user during the organization-defined time period;
                  (iii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the time
                        period for lock out mode or delay period;
                  (iv) the organization selects either a lock out mode for the organization-defined time
                        period or delays next login prompt for the organization-defined delay period for
                        information system responses to consecutive invalid access attempts;
                  (v) the information system enforces the organization-selected lock out mode or delayed
                        login prompt.

 AC-8             SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

                  Control: The information system displays an approved, system use notification message
                  before granting system access informing potential users: (i) that the user is accessing a
                  U.S. Government information system; (ii) that system usage may be monitored, recorded,
                  and subject to audit; (iii) that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to
                  criminal and civil penalties; and (iv) that use of the system indicates consent to
                  monitoring and recording. The system use notification message provides appropriate
                  privacy and security notices (based on associated privacy and security policies or
                  summaries) and remains on the screen until the user takes explicit actions to log on to the
                  information system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Privacy and security policies are consistent with applicable laws,
                  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. System use
                  notification messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed
                  when individuals log in to the information system. For publicly accessible systems: (i)
                  the system use information is available and when appropriate, is displayed before
                  granting access; (ii) any references to monitoring, recording, or auditing are in keeping
                  with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities;
                  and (iii) the notice given to public users of the information system includes a description
                  of the authorized uses of the system.

 AC-8.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:

                        system access informing potential users:
                             - that the user is accessing a U.S. Government information system;
                             - that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
                             - that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and
                               civil penalties; and
                             - that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;
                  (ii) the system use notification message provides appropriate privacy and security
                        notices (based on associated privacy and security policies or summaries);
                  (iii) the organization approves the information system use notification message before
                        its use; and
                  (iv) the system use notification message remains on the screen until the user takes
                        explicit actions to log on to the information system.

 AC-11            SESSION LOCK

                  Control: The information system prevents further access to the system by initiating a
                  session lock after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity, and the
                  session lock remains in effect until the user reestablishes access using appropriate
                  identification and authentication procedures.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Users can directly initiate session lock mechanisms. A session
                  lock is not a substitute for logging out of the information system. Organization-defined
                  time periods of inactivity comply with federal policy; for example, in accordance with
                  OMB Memorandum 06-16, the organization-defined time period is no greater than thirty
                  minutes for remote access and portable devices.

                   Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the time
                        period of user inactivity after which the information system initiates a session lock;
                  (ii) the information system initiates a session lock after the organization-defined time
                        period of inactivity;
                  (iii) the information system provides the capability for users to directly initiate session
                        lock mechanisms; and
                  (iv) the information system maintains the session lock until the user reestablishes access
                        using appropriate identification and authentication procedures.

 AC-12            SESSION TERMINATION

                  Control: The information system automatically terminates a remote session after
                  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity.
                  Supplemental Guidance: A remote session is initiated whenever an organizational
                  information system is accessed by a user (or an information system) communicating
                  through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).

 AC-12.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                   Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the time
                       period of user inactivity that initiates a remote session termination within the
                       information system; and
                  (ii) the information system automatically terminates a remote session after the
                       organization-defined time period of inactivity.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:

 AC-13            SUPERVISION AND REVIEW — ACCESS CONTROL

                  Control: The organization supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect to the
                  enforcement and usage of information system access controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews audit records (e.g., user activity logs) for
                  inappropriate activities in accordance with organizational procedures. The organization
                  investigates any unusual information system-related activities and periodically reviews
                  changes to access authorizations. The organization reviews more frequently the activities
                  of users with significant information system roles and responsibilities. The extent of the
                  audit record reviews is based on the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system.
                  For example, for low-impact systems, it is not intended that security logs be reviewed
                  frequently for every workstation, but rather at central points such as a web proxy or email
                  servers and when specific circumstances warrant review of other audit records. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on computer security log management.

 AC-13.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect
                  to the enforcement and usage of information system access controls.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing supervision and review of
                           access control enforcement and usage; organizational records of supervisory notices of
                           disciplinary actions to users; information system exception reports; other relevant

 AC-17            REMOTE ACCESS

                  Control: The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls all methods of remote access
                  to the information system.
                  Supplemental Guidance:   Remote access is any access to an organizational information
                  system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-
                  organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods
                  include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Remote access controls are applicable to
                  information systems other than public web servers or systems specifically designed for
                  public access. The organization restricts access achieved through dial-up connections
                  (e.g., limiting dial-up access based upon source of request) or protects against
                  unauthorized connections or subversion of authorized connections (e.g., using virtual
                  private network technology). NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on
                  remote electronic authentication. If the federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
                  credential is used as an identification token where cryptographic token-based access
                  control is employed, the access control system conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201
                  and NIST Special Publications 800-73 and 800-78. NIST Special Publication 800-77
                  provides guidance on IPsec-based virtual private networks. Related security control: IA-
                  2.

 AC-17.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization authorizes, monitors, and controls remote access to the
                  information system for all allowed methods of remote access to include both
                  establishment of the remote connection and subsequent user actions across that
                  connection.

 AC-20            USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

                  Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions for authorized individuals to:
                  (i) access the information system from an external information system; and (ii) process,
                  store, and/or transmit organization-controlled information using an external information
                  system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or
                  components of information systems that are outside of the accreditation boundary
                  established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct
                  control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security
                  control effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to,
                  personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal
                  digital assistants); privately owned computing and communications devices resident in
                  commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); information
                  systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and federal
                  information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct control of the
                  organization.
                  Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other
                  individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system. This control
                  does not apply to the use of external information systems to access organizational
                  information systems and information that are intended for public access (e.g., individuals
                  accessing federal information through public interfaces to organizational information
                  systems). The organization establishes terms and conditions for the use of external
                  information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures.
                  The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of applications that can be
                  accessed on the organizational information system from the external information system;
                  and (ii) the maximum FIPS 199 security category of information that can be processed,
                  stored, and transmitted on the external information system.

 AU-2             AUDITABLE EVENTS

                  Control: The information system generates audit records for the following events:
                           [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events].
                  Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to identify important events which
                  need to be audited as significant and relevant to the security of the information system.
                  The organization specifies which information system components carry out auditing
                  activities. Auditing activity can affect information system performance. Therefore, the
                  organization decides, based upon a risk assessment, which events require auditing on a
                  continuous basis and which events require auditing in response to specific situations.
                  Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet
                  level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of abstraction for
                  audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the
                  identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is
                  coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual
                  support between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each
                  function. The checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html
                  provide recommended lists of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events
                  that are adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on computer security log management.

 AU-2.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:

                        system auditable events;
                  (ii) the organization-defined auditable events include those deemed by the organization
                        to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents;
                  (iii) the information system generates audit records for the organization-defined
                        auditable events;
                  (iv) the organization specifies which information system components carry out auditing
                        activities; and
                  (v) the organization decides, based upon a risk assessment, which events require
                        auditing on a continuous basis and which events require auditing in response to

 AU-10            NON-REPUDIATION

                  Control: The information system provides the capability to determine whether a given
                  individual took a particular action.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include
                  creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating
                  concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message. Non-repudiation protects
                  against later false claims by an individual of not having taken a specific action. Non-
                  repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a
                  particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not
                  having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. Non-
                  repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an
                  individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a
                  contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Non-
                  repudiation services are obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g.,
                  digital signatures, digital message receipts, time stamps).

 AU-11            AUDIT RECORD RETENTION

                  Control: The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time
                  period] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to
                  meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization retains audit records until it is determined that
                  they are no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes.
                  This includes, for example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom
                  of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions. Standard
                  categorizations of audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response
                  processes for each type of action are developed and disseminated. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-61 provides guidance on computer security incident handling and audit
                  record retention.

 AU-11.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines the retention period for audit records generated by the
                       information system; and
                  (ii) the organization retains information system audit records for the organization-
                       defined time period to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security
                       incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention
                       requirements.

 CA-1             CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION, AND SECURITY ASSESSMENT POLICIES AND
                  PROCEDURES

                  Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i)
                  formal, documented, security assessment and certification and accreditation policies that
                  address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination
                  among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to
                  facilitate the implementation of the security assessment and certification and accreditation
                  policies and associated assessment, certification, and accreditation controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The security assessment and certification and accreditation
                  policies and procedures are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                  policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The security assessment and certification
                  and accreditation policies can be included as part of the general information security
                  policy for the organization. Security assessment and certification and accreditation
                  procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular
                  information system, when required. The organization defines what constitutes a
                  significant change to the information system to achieve consistent security
                  reaccreditations. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security
                  control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security
                  certification and accreditation. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on
                  security policies and procedures.

 CA-1.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization develops and documents security assessment and certification and
                        accreditation policies and procedures;
                  (ii) the organization disseminates security assessment and certification and
                        accreditation policies and procedures to appropriate elements within the
                        organization;
                  (iii) responsible parties within the organization periodically review policy and
                        procedures; and
                  (iv) the organization updates security assessment and certification and accreditation
                        policies and procedures when organizational review indicates updates are required.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:

                                         ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 CA-2             SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

                  Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the
                  information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] to
                  determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
                  intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                  requirements for the system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to support the FISMA requirement that the
                  management, operational, and technical controls in each information system contained in
                  the inventory of major information systems be assessed with a frequency depending on
                  risk, but no less than annually. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security
                  control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional
                  assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security
                  certification and accreditation process. To satisfy the annual FISMA assessment
                  requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment results from
                  any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security certifications
                  conducted as part of an information system accreditation or reaccreditation process (see
                  CA-4); (ii) continuous monitoring activities (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of
                  the information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle process
                  (provided that the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the
                  determination of security control effectiveness). Existing security assessment results are
                  reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional
                  assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment information is critical in achieving a broad-
                  based, cost-effective, and fully integrated security program capable of producing the
                  needed evidence to determine the actual security status of the information system.
                  OMB does not require an annual assessment of all security controls employed in an
                  organizational information system. In accordance with OMB policy, organizations must
                  annually assess a subset of the security controls based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security
                  categorization of the information system; (ii) the specific security controls selected and
                  employed by the organization to protect the information system; and (iii) the level of
                  assurance (or confidence) that the organization must have in determining the
                  effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. It is expected that the
                  organization will assess all of the security controls in the information system during the
                  three-year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year’s assessment
                  results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA assessment
                  requirement (see CA-4). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on
                  security control assessments to include reuse of existing assessment results. Related
                  security controls: CA-4, CA-6, CA-7, SA-11.

 CA-3             INFORMATION SYSTEM CONNECTIONS

                  Control: The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to other
                  information systems outside of the accreditation boundary through the use of system
                  connection agreements and monitors/controls the system connections on an ongoing
                  basis.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Since FIPS 199 security categorizations apply to individual
                  information systems, the organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced
                  when systems are connected to other information systems with different security
                  requirements and security controls, both within the organization and external to the
                  organization. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same
                  networks. NIST Special Publication 800-47 provides guidance on connecting
                  information systems. Related security controls: SC-7, SA-9.

 CA-3.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization identifies all connections to external information systems (i.e.,
                        information systems outside of the accreditation boundary);
                  (ii) the organization authorizes all connections from the information system to external
                        information systems through the use of system connection agreements; and
                  (iii) the organization monitors/controls the system interconnections on an ongoing basis.

                  Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the
                  information system to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
                  correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
                  meeting the security requirements for the system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: A security certification is conducted by the organization in support
                  of the OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III requirement for accrediting the information
                  system. The security certification is a key factor in all security accreditation (i.e.,
                  authorization) decisions and is integrated into and spans the system development life
                  cycle. The organization assesses all security controls in an information system during the
                  initial security accreditation. Subsequent to the initial accreditation and in accordance
                  with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the controls annually during
                  continuous monitoring (see CA-7). The organization can use the current year’s
                  assessment results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA
                  assessment requirement (see CA-2). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides
                  guidance on security control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides
                  guidance on security certification and accreditation. Related security controls: CA-2,
                  CA-6, SA-11.

 CA-4.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information
                       system to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
                       operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting
                       the security requirements for the system; and
                  (ii) the organization employs a security certification process in accordance with OMB
                       policy and NIST Special Publications 800-37 and 800-53A.

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 CA-4(1)          SECURITY CERTIFICATION
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct
                  an assessment of the security controls in the information system.

                  Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An independent certification agent or certification
                  team is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an
                  organizational information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from
                  any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental,
                  operational, and/or management chain of command associated with the information
                  system or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security
                  certification services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can
                  be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted
                  certification services are considered independent if the information system owner is not
                  directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence
                  of the certification agent or certification team conducting the assessment of the security
                  controls in the information system. The authorizing official decides on the required level
                  of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity of the information system
                  and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, and to
                  individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of certifier independence is
                  sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can
                  be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when
                  the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure
                  requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished by individuals that
                  are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or
                  authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be achieved by ensuring
                  the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of
                  experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results. The
                  authorizing official should consult with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior
                  agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to fully discuss the
                  implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special
                  circumstances described above.

 CA-4(1).1        ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization employs an independent certification agent or certification
                  team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Certification and accreditation policy; procedures addressing security
                           certification; security accreditation package (including security plan, security assessment
                           report, plan of action and milestones, authorization statement); other relevant documents or

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 CA-5             PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES

                  Control: The organization develops and updates [Assignment: organization-defined
                  frequency], a plan of action and milestones for the information system that documents the
                  organization’s planned, implemented, and evaluated remedial actions to correct
                  deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or
                  eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the
                  security accreditation package developed for the authorizing official and is subject to
                  federal reporting requirements established by OMB. The plan of action and milestones
                  updates are based on the findings from security control assessments, security impact
                  analyses, and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA reporting guidance
                  contains instructions regarding organizational plans of action and milestones. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the security certification and
                  accreditation of information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides
                  guidance on risk mitigation.

 CA-5.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization develops a plan of action and milestones for the information
                        system;
                  (ii) the plan of action and milestones documents the planned, implemented, and
                        evaluated remedial actions by the organization to correct deficiencies noted during
                        the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known
                        vulnerabilities in the system;
                  (iii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        frequency of plan of action and milestone updates; and
                  (iv) the organization updates the plan of action and milestones at an organization-
                        defined frequency.

 CA-6             SECURITY ACCREDITATION

                  Control: The organization authorizes (i.e., accredits) the information system for processing
                  before operations and updates the authorization [Assignment: organization-defined
                  frequency, at least every three years] or when there is a significant change to the system.
                  A senior organizational official signs and approves the security accreditation.
                  Supplemental Guidance: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, establishes policy for security
                  accreditations of federal information systems. The organization assesses the security
                  controls employed within the information system before and in support of the security
                  accreditation. Security assessments conducted in support of security accreditations are
                  called security certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is not a
                  static process. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring
                  process (the fourth and final phase of the certification and accreditation process), the
                  critical information contained in the accreditation package (i.e., the system security plan,
                  the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones) is updated on an
                  ongoing basis providing the authorizing official and the information system owner with
                  an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To reduce the
                  administrative burden of the three-year reaccreditation process, the authorizing official
                  uses the results of the ongoing continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent
                  possible as the basis for rendering a reaccreditation decision. NIST Special Publication
                  800-37 provides guidance on the security certification and accreditation of information
                  systems. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-7.

 CA-6.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        frequency of authorization updates, not to exceed three years;
                  (ii) the organization authorizes (i.e., accredits) the information system for processing
                        before operations and updates the authorization at an organization-defined
                        frequency or when there is a significant change to the information system;
                  (iii) a senior organizational official signs and approves the security accreditation; and
                  (iv) the security accreditation process employed by the organization is consistent with
                        NIST Special Publications 800-37.

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 CA-7             CONTINUOUS MONITORING

                  Control: The organization monitors the security controls in the information system on an
                  ongoing basis.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring activities include configuration
                  management and control of information system components, security impact analyses of
                  changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The
                  organization assesses all security controls in an information system during the initial
                  security accreditation. Subsequent to the initial accreditation and in accordance with
                  OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the controls annually during
                  continuous monitoring. The selection of an appropriate subset of security controls is
                  based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system; (ii) the
                  specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the
                  information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or grounds for confidence) that the
                  organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the
                  information system. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently
                  selects a subset of the security controls employed within the information system for
                  assessment. The organization also establishes the schedule for control monitoring to
                  ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Those security controls that are volatile or critical
                  to protecting the information system are assessed at least annually. All other controls are
                  assessed at least once during the information system’s three-year accreditation cycle. The
                  organization can use the current year’s assessment results obtained during continuous
                  monitoring to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2).
                  This control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in
                  monitoring configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous
                  monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the information system security plan,
                  the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones—the three principle
                  documents in the security accreditation package. A rigorous and well executed
                  continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the level of effort required for the
                  reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides
                  guidance on the continuous monitoring process. NIST Special Publication 800-53A
                  provides guidance on the assessment of security controls. Related security controls: CA-
                  2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.

 CM-1             CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                  Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a
                  formal, documented, configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope,
                  roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
                  entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the
                  implementation of the configuration management policy and associated configuration
                  management controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The configuration management policy and procedures are
                  consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
                  standards, and guidance. The configuration management policy can be included as part
                  of the general information security policy for the organization. Configuration
                  management procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a
                  particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides
                  guidance on security policies and procedures.

 CM-2             BASELINE CONFIGURATION

                  Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains a current baseline
                  configuration of the information system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: This control establishes a baseline configuration for the
                  information system. The baseline configuration provides information about a particular
                  component’s makeup (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation or notebook
                  computer including updated patch information) and the component’s logical placement
                  within the information system architecture. The baseline configuration also provides the
                  organization with a well-defined and documented specification to which the information
                  system is built and deviations, if required, are documented in support of mission
                  needs/objectives. The baseline configuration of the information system is consistent with
                  the Federal Enterprise Architecture. Related security controls: CM-6, CM-8.

 CM-2.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization develops and documents a baseline configuration of the
                        information system that is consistent with the Federal Enterprise Architecture,
                        shows relationships among information system components, and provides a well-
                        defined and documented specification to which the information system is built;
                  (ii) the organization maintains the baseline configuration; and
                  (iii) the organization documents deviations from the baseline configuration, in support
                        of mission needs/objectives.

 CM-3             CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

                  Control: The organization authorizes, documents, and controls changes to the information
                  system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization manages configuration changes to the
                  information system using an organizationally approved process (e.g., a chartered
                  Configuration Control Board). Configuration change control involves the systematic
                  proposal, justification, implementation, test/evaluation, review, and disposition of
                  changes to the information system, including upgrades and modifications. Configuration
                  change control includes changes to the configuration settings for information technology
                  products (e.g., operating systems, firewalls, routers). The organization includes
                  emergency changes in the configuration change control process, including changes
                  resulting from the remediation of flaws. The approvals to implement a change to the
                  information system include successful results from the security analysis of the change.
                  The organization audits activities associated with configuration changes to the
                  information system. Related security controls: CM-4, CM-6, SI-2.

 CM-3(ICS-1)      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL
                  ICS Control Enhancements:
                  The organization tests, validates, and documents changes (e.g., patches and updates) before
                  implementing the changes on the operational ICS.

                  ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that testing does not
                  interfere with ICS functions. The individual/group conducting the tests fully
                  understands the organizational information security policies and procedures, the ICS
                  security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
                  associated with a particular facility and/or process. A production ICS may need to be
                  taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If an
                  ICS must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned
                  ICS outages whenever possible. In situations where the organization cannot, for
                  operational reasons, conduct live testing of a production ICS, the organization employs
                  compensating controls (e.g., providing a replicated system to conduct testing) in
                  accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

 CM-4             MONITORING CONFIGURATION CHANGES

                  Control: The organization monitors changes to the information system conducting security
                  impact analyses to determine the effects of the changes.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Prior to change implementation, and as part of the change
                  approval process, the organization analyzes changes to the information system for
                  potential security impacts. After the information system is changed (including upgrades
                  and modifications), the organization checks the security features to verify that the features
                  are still functioning properly. The organization audits activities associated with
                  configuration changes to the information system. Monitoring configuration changes and
                  conducting security impact analyses are important elements with regard to the ongoing
                  assessment of security controls in the information system. Related security control: CA-
                  7.

 CM-4.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization monitors changes to the information system by verifying
                  that the organization:
                  - prior to change implementation and as part of the change approval process, conducts
                      security impact analyses to assess the effects of the system changes;
                  - after the system is changed (including upgrades and modifications), checks the
                      security features to confirm that the features are still functioning properly; and
                  - audits activities associated with configuration changes to the information system.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing the monitoring of
                           configuration changes to the information system; information system architecture and

 CM-6             CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

                  Control: The organization: (i) establishes mandatory configuration settings for information
                  technology products employed within the information system; (ii) configures the security
                  settings of information technology products to the most restrictive mode consistent with
                  operational requirements; (iii) documents the configuration settings; and (iv) enforces the
                  configuration settings in all components of the information system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the configurable parameters of the
                  information technology products that compose the information system. Organizations
                  monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with
                  organizational policies and procedures. OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide
                  guidance on configuration requirements for federal information systems. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-70 provides guidance on producing and using configuration settings for
                  information technology products employed in organizational information systems.

 CM-7             LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

                  Control: The organization configures the information system to provide only essential
                  capabilities and specifically prohibits and/or restricts the use of the following functions,
                  ports, protocols, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined list of prohibited
                  and/or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of
                  functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not
                  be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
                  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single
                  component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the
                  services provided by any one component. Where feasible, the organization limits
                  component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email server or web server,
                  not both). The functions and services provided by information systems, or individual
                  components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine which functions
                  and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant
                  Messaging, File Transfer Protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, file sharing).

 CM-7.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, prohibited or
                        restricted functions, ports, protocols, and services for the information system;
                  (ii) the organization configures the information system to provide only essential
                        capabilities; and
                  (iii) the organization configures the information system to specifically prohibit and/or
                        restrict the use of organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate level of granularity
                  for the information system components included in the inventory that are subject to
                  management control (i.e., tracking, and reporting). The inventory of information system
                  components includes any information determined to be necessary by the organization to
                  achieve effective property accountability (e.g., manufacturer, model number, serial
                  number, software license information, system/component owner). The component
                  inventory is consistent with the accreditation boundary of the information system.

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 CP-4             CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING AND EXERCISES

                  Control: The organization: (i) tests and/or exercises the contingency plan for the
                  information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] using
                  [Assignment: organization-defined tests and/or exercises] to determine the plan’s
                  effectiveness and the organization’s readiness to execute the plan; and (ii) reviews the
                  contingency plan test/exercise results and initiates corrective actions.
                  Supplemental Guidance: There are several methods for testing and/or exercising
                  contingency plans to identify potential weaknesses (e.g., full-scale contingency plan
                  testing, functional/tabletop exercises). The depth and rigor of contingency plan testing
                  and/or exercises increases with the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system.
                  Contingency plan testing and/or exercises also include a determination of the effects on
                  organizational operations and assets (e.g., reduction in mission capability) and individuals
                  arising due to contingency operations in accordance with the plan. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-84 provides guidance on test, training, and exercise programs for
                  information technology plans and capabilities.

                  (ii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        frequency of contingency plan tests and/or exercises and the frequency is at least
                        annually;
                  (iii) the organization tests/exercises the contingency plan using organization-defined
                        tests/exercises in accordance with organization-defined frequency; and
                  (iv) the organization reviews the contingency plan test/exercise results and takes
                        corrective actions.

 CP-9             INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP

                  Control: The organization conducts backups of user-level and system-level information
                  (including system state information) contained in the information system [Assignment:
                  organization-defined frequency] and protects backup information at the storage location.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate
                  of backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the
                  organization’s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. While integrity
                  and availability are the primary concerns for system backup information, protecting
                  backup information from unauthorized disclosure is also an important consideration
                  depending on the type of information residing on the backup media and the FIPS 199
                  impact level. An organizational assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for
                  backup information. The protection of system backup information while in transit is
                  beyond the scope of this control. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.

                  (ii) the organization backs up user-level and system-level information (including system
                        state information) in accordance with the organization-defined frequency; and
                  (iii) the organization backs up information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) at
                        a frequency and transfer rate consistent with the organization’s recovery time
                        objectives and recovery point objectives.

 CP-10            INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

                  Control: The organization employs mechanisms with supporting procedures to allow the
                  information system to be recovered and reconstituted to a known secure state after a
                  disruption or failure.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information system recovery and reconstitution to a known secure
                  state means that all system parameters (either default or organization-established) are set
                  to secure values, security-critical patches are reinstalled, security-related configuration
                  settings are reestablished, system documentation and operating procedures are available,
                  application and system software is reinstalled and configured with secure settings,
                  information from the most recent, known secure backups is loaded, and the system is
                  fully tested.

 CP-10.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization provides and applies mechanisms and procedures for
                  recovery and reconstitution of the information system to known secure state after
                  disruption or failure.

 IA-1             IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                  Control:  The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a
                  formal, documented, identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose,
                  scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
                  organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to
                  facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and associated
                  identification and authentication controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance:   The identification and authentication policy and procedures are
                  consistent with: (i) FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78; and
                  (ii) other applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
                  and guidance. The identification and authentication policy can be included as part of the
                  general information security policy for the organization. Identification and authentication
                  procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular
                  information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance
                  on security policies and procedures. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance
                  on remote electronic authentication.

                                         ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 IA-2             USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

                  Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates users (or processes
                  acting on behalf of users).
                  Supplemental Guidance: Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses
                  other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in
                  accordance security control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished
                  through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor
                  authentication, some combination thereof. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides
                  guidance on remote electronic authentication including strength of authentication
                  mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in Special Publication
                  800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems. Remote access
                  is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information
                  system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g.,
                  the Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a
                  user (or an information system) communicating through an internal organization-
                  controlled network (e.g., local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a
                  network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is specified, authentication for
                  both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 800-63
                  level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78
                  specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique
                  identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to
                  identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system
                  logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application
                  level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
                  In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative,
                  authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required
                  to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment
                  conducted in accordance with OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST
                  Special Publication 800-63 compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the
                  IA-2 control and its enhancements. Scalability, practicality, and security issues are
                  simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for public access to
                  such information and information systems with the need to protect organizational
                  operations, organizational assets, and individuals. Related security controls: AC-14, AC-

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 IA-3             DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

                  Control: The information system identifies and authenticates specific devices before
                  establishing a connection.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The information system typically uses either shared known
                  information (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control
                  Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses) or an organizational authentication
                  solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius
                  server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication) to identify and
                  authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. The required strength of the
                  device authentication mechanism is determined by the FIPS 199 security categorization
                  of the information system with higher impact levels requiring stronger authentication.

 IA-3.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines the devices for which identification and authentication is
                        required before establishing connections to the information system;
                  (ii) the information system uniquely identifies and authenticates the devices defined by
                        the organization before establishing connections to the information system; and
                  (iii) the information system employs device authentication mechanisms with strength of
                        mechanism determined by the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information
                        system.

 IA-4             IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

                  Control: The organization manages user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying each user;
                  (ii) verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user
                  identifier from an appropriate organization official; (iv) issuing the user identifier to the
                  intended party; (v) disabling the user identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined
                  time period] of inactivity; and (vi) archiving user identifiers.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Identifier management is not applicable to shared information
                  system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). FIPS 201 and Special
                  Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV)
                  credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and
                  contractors.

 IA-4.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization manages user identifiers by uniquely identifying each user;
                  (ii) the organization manages user identifiers by verifying the identity of each user;
                  (iii) the organization manages user identifiers by receiving authorization to issue a user
                        identifier from an appropriate organization official;
                  (iv) the organization manages user identifiers by issuing the identifier to the intended
                        party;
                  (v) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the time
                        period of inactivity after which a user identifier is to be disabled;
                  (vi) the organization manages user identifiers by disabling the identifier after the
                        organization-defined time period of inactivity; and
                  (vii) the organization manages user identifiers by archiving identifiers.

                                            ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 IA-5             AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

                  Control: The organization manages information system authenticators by: (i) defining
                  initial authenticator content; (ii) establishing administrative procedures for initial
                  authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for
                  revoking authenticators; (iii) changing default authenticators upon information system
                  installation; and (iv) changing/refreshing authenticators periodically.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information system authenticators include, for example, tokens,
                  PKI certificates, biometrics, passwords, and key cards. Users take reasonable measures to
                  safeguard authenticators including maintaining possession of their individual
                  authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or
                  compromised authenticators immediately. For password-based authentication, the
                  information system: (i) protects passwords from unauthorized disclosure and modification
                  when stored and transmitted; (ii) prohibits passwords from being displayed when entered;
                  (iii) enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions; and (iv) prohibits
                  password reuse for a specified number of generations. For PKI-based authentication, the
                  information system: (i) validates certificates by constructing a certification path to an
                  accepted trust anchor; (ii) establishes user control of the corresponding private key; and
                  (iii) maps the authenticated identity to the user account. In accordance with OMB policy
                  and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal
                  information systems (and associated authenticator management) may also be required to
                  protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-
                  73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in
                  the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication.

 IA-5.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization manages information system authenticators by defining initial
                        authenticator content;
                  (ii) the organization manages information system authenticators by establishing
                        administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for
                        lost/compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
                  (iii) the organization manages information system authenticators by changing default
                        authenticators upon information system installation; and
                  (iv) the organization manages information system authenticators by changing/refreshing
                        authenticators periodically.

 IA-6             AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK

                  Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during
                  the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by
                  unauthorized individuals.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from the information system does not provide
                  information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication
                  mechanism. Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of
                  obscuring feedback of authentication information.

 IA-6.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information system obscures feedback of authentication information
                  during the authentication process to protect the information from possible
                  exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.

                  Control: The information system employs authentication methods that meet the
                  requirements of applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
                  standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.
                  Supplemental Guidance:  The applicable federal standard for authentication to a
                  cryptographic module is FIPS 140-2 (as amended). Validation certificates issued by the
                  NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (including FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2, and
                  future amendments) remain in effect, and the modules remain available for continued use
                  and purchase until a validation certificate is specifically revoked. Additional information
                  on the use of validated cryptography is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval.

 IA-7.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information system employs authentication methods that meet the
                  requirements of applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
                  standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module (for non-national
                  security systems, the cryptographic requirements are defined by FIPS 140-2, as

                  applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                  guidance. The incident response policy can be included as part of the general information
                  security policy for the organization. Incident response procedures can be developed for
                  the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required.
                  NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.

 MA-4             REMOTE MAINTENANCE

                  Control: The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls any remotely executed
                  maintenance and diagnostic activities, if employed.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Remote maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by
                  individuals communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network
                  (e.g., the Internet). The use of remote maintenance and diagnostic tools is consistent with
                  organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the information system.
                  The organization maintains records for all remote maintenance and diagnostic activities.
                  Other techniques and/or controls to consider for improving the security of remote
                  maintenance include: (i) encryption and decryption of communications; (ii) strong
                  identification and authentication techniques, such as Level 3 or 4 tokens as described in
                  NIST Special Publication 800-63; and (iii) remote disconnect verification. When remote
                  maintenance is completed, the organization (or information system in certain cases)
                  terminates all sessions and remote connections invoked in the performance of that
                  activity. If password-based authentication is used to accomplish remote maintenance, the
                  organization changes the passwords following each remote maintenance service. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National
                  Security Agency provides a listing of approved media sanitization products at
                  http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm. Related security controls: IA-2, MP-6.

 MA-4.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization authorizes, monitors, and controls the execution of maintenance
                        and diagnostic activities conducted remotely by individuals communicating through
                        an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet), if employed;
                  (ii) the organization documents in the security plan, the remote maintenance and
                        diagnostic tools to be employed;
                  (iii) the organization maintains records for all remote maintenance and diagnostic
                        activities;
                  (iv) the organization (or information system in certain cases) terminates all sessions and
                        remote connections invoked in the performance of remote maintenance and
                        diagnostic activity when the remote maintenance or diagnostics is completed; and
                  (v) the organization changes the passwords following each remote maintenance and
                        diagnostic activity if password-based authentication is used to accomplish remote
                        maintenance.

 MP-2             MEDIA ACCESS

                  Control: The organization restricts access to information system media to authorized
                  individuals.
                  Supplemental Guidance:   Information system media includes both digital media (e.g.,
                  diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact
                  disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control
                  also applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
                  information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants,
                  cellular telephones).
                  An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated
                  information contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document
                  in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to
                  access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict access. The rigor with which
                  this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
                  information contained on the media. For example, fewer protection measures are needed
                  for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public
                  domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the
                  organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these
                  situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the media resides provide
                  adequate protection.

 MP-2.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the organization restricts access to information system media to authorized
                  users.

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 MP-2(1)          MEDIA ACCESS
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage areas
                  and to audit access attempts and access granted.

                  Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is primarily applicable to
                  designated media storage areas within an organization where a significant volume of
                  media is stored and is not intended to apply to every location where some media is stored
                  (e.g., in individual offices).

 MP-2(1).1        ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage
                       areas; and
                  (ii) the organization employs automated mechanisms to audit access attempts and
                       access granted.

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 MP-3             MEDIA LABELING

                  Control: The organization: (i) affixes external labels to removable information system
                  media and information system output indicating the distribution limitations, handling
                  caveats and applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and (ii) exempts
                  [Assignment: organization-defined list of media types or hardware components] from
                  labeling so long as they remain within [Assignment: organization-defined protected
                  environment].
                  Supplemental Guidance: An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media
                  requiring labeling. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media
                  requiring labeling and the specific measures taken to afford such protection. The rigor
                  with which this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security
                  categorization of the information contained on the media. For example, labeling is not
                  required for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the
                  public domain or to be publicly releasable.

 MP-3.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, its protected
                        environment for media labeling requirements;
                  (ii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, media types
                        and hardware components that are exempted from external labeling requirements;
                        and
                  (iii) the organization affixes external labels to removable information storage media and
                        information system output not otherwise exempted from this labeling requirement,
                        indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats, and applicable security
                        markings (if any) of the information.

                                        ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 MP-4             MEDIA STORAGE

                  Control: The organization physically controls and securely stores information system
                  media within controlled areas.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g.,
                  diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact
                  disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled
                  area is any area or space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and
                  procedural protections provided are sufficient to meet the requirements established for
                  protecting the information and/or information system. This control applies to portable
                  and mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability
                  (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones). Telephone
                  systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store
                  information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do
                  not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms
                  typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel exercise
                  extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems.
                  An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated
                  information contained on that media requiring physical protection. Organizations
                  document in policy and procedures, the media requiring physical protection and the
                  specific measures taken to afford such protection. The rigor with which this control is
                  applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information
                  contained on the media. For example, fewer protection measures are needed for media
                  containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be
                  publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the organization or
                  individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is
                  assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where the media resides provide
                  adequate protection. The organization protects information system media identified by
                  the organization until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment,
                  techniques, and procedures.
                  As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers routinely
                  encrypting information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. FIPS 199 security
                  categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for secondary storage
                  encryption. The organization implements effective cryptographic key management in
                  support of secondary storage encryption and provides protections to maintain the
                  availability of the information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.
                  NIST Special Publications 800-56 and 800-57 provide guidance on cryptographic key
                  establishment and cryptographic key management. Related security controls: CP-9, RA-

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 MP-5             MEDIA TRANSPORT

                  Control: The organization protects and controls information system media during transport
                  outside of controlled areas and restricts the activities associated with transport of such
                  media to authorized personnel.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g.,
                  diskettes, tapes, removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
                  disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or
                  space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural
                  protections provided are sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the
                  information and/or information system. This control also applies to portable and mobile
                  computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
                  notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones) that are transported
                  outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also considered information systems
                  and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail
                  systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification,
                  authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information
                  systems, organizational personnel exercise extreme caution in the types of information
                  stored on telephone voicemail systems that are transported outside of controlled areas.
                  An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated
                  information contained on that media requiring protection during transport. Organizations
                  document in policy and procedures, the media requiring protection during transport and
                  the specific measures taken to protect such transported media. The rigor with which this
                  control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
                  information contained on the media. An organizational assessment of risk also guides the
                  selection and use of appropriate storage containers for transporting non-digital media.
                  Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the
                  organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).

 MP-5.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization identifies personnel authorized to transport information system
                        media outside of controlled areas;
                  (ii) the organization documents, in policy and procedures, the media requiring
                        protection during transport and the specific measures taken to protect such
                        transported media;
                  (iii) the organization protects and controls information system media during transport
                        outside of controlled areas; and
                  (iv) the organization restricts the activities associated with transport of information
                        system media to authorized personnel.

 MP-5(1)          MEDIA TRANSPORT
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The organization protects digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled
                  areas using [Assignment: organization-defined security measures, e.g., locked container,

 MP-6             MEDIA SANITIZATION AND DISPOSAL

                  Control: The organization sanitizes information system media, both digital and non-
                  digital, prior to disposal or release for reuse.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Sanitization is the process used to remove information from
                  information system media such that there is reasonable assurance, in proportion to the
                  confidentiality of the information, that the information cannot be retrieved or
                  reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, and destroying media
                  information, prevent the disclosure of organizational information to unauthorized
                  individuals when such media is reused or disposed. The organization uses its discretion
                  on sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be
                  in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on the
                  organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposed. NIST Special Publication
                  800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security Agency also
                  provides media sanitization guidance and maintains a listing of approved sanitization
                  products at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm.

 MP-6.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization identifies information system media requiring sanitization and the
                        appropriate sanitization techniques and procedures to be used in the process;
                  (ii) the organization sanitizes identified information system media, both paper and
                        digital, prior to disposal or release for reuse; and
                  (iii) information system media sanitation is consistent with NIST Special Publication
                        800-88.

 PE-3             PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

                  Control: The organization controls all physical access points (including designated
                  entry/exit points) to the facility where the information system resides (except for those
                  areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible) and verifies
                  individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility. The organization
                  controls access to areas officially designated as publicly accessible, as appropriate, in
                  accordance with the organization’s assessment of risk.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization uses physical access devices (e.g., keys, locks,
                  combinations, card readers) and/or guards to control entry to facilities containing
                  information systems. The organization secures keys, combinations, and other access
                  devices and inventories those devices regularly. The organization changes combinations
                  and keys: (i) periodically; and (ii) when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or
                  individuals are transferred or terminated. Workstations and associated peripherals
                  connected to (and part of) an organizational information system may be located in areas
                  designated as publicly accessible with access to such devices being appropriately
                  controlled. Where federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential is used as an
                  identification token and token-based access control is employed, the access control
                  system conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publication 800-73.
                  If the token-based access control function employs cryptographic verification, the access
                  control system conforms to the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-78. If the
                  token-based access control function employs biometric verification, the access control
                  system conforms to the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-76.

                                            ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 PE-3(1)          PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL
                  Control Enhancement:
                  The organization controls physical access to the information system independent of the
                  physical access controls for the facility.

                  Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement, in general, applies to
                  server rooms, communications centers, or any other areas within a facility containing
                  large concentrations of information system components or components with a higher
                  impact level than that of the majority of the facility. The intent is to provide an additional
                  layer of physical security for those areas where the organization may be more vulnerable
                  due to the concentration of information system components or the impact level of the
                  components. The control enhancement is not intended to apply to workstations or
                  peripheral devices that are typically dispersed throughout the facility and used routinely
                  by organizational personnel.

 PE-3(1).1        ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization identifies specific areas within the facility that, due to the
                       concentration of information system components or the impact level of the
                       components, require additional physical protections over those afforded to the
                       facility as a whole; and
                  (ii) for an information system identified as requiring additional physical protection or
                       part of a large concentration of information system components, the organization
                       controls physical access to the system independent of the physical access controls
                       for the facility.

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 PL-1             SECURITY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                  Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a
                  formal, documented, security planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                  and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation
                  of the security planning policy and associated security planning controls.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The security planning policy and procedures are consistent with
                  applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                  guidance. The security planning policy addresses the overall policy requirements for
                  confidentiality, integrity, and availability and can be included as part of the general
                  information security policy for the organization. Security planning procedures can be
                  developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information system,
                  when required. NIST Special Publication 800-18 provides guidance on security planning.
                  NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.

 PL-1.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 RA-2             SECURITY CATEGORIZATION

                  Control: The organization categorizes the information system and the information
                  processed, stored, or transmitted by the system in accordance with applicable laws,
                  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and
                  documents the results (including supporting rationale) in the system security plan.
                  Designated senior-level officials within the organization review and approve the security
                  categorizations.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The applicable federal standard for security categorization of
                  nonnational security information and information systems is FIPS 199. The organization
                  conducts FIPS 199 security categorizations as an organization-wide activity with the
                  involvement of the chief information officer, senior agency information security officer,
                  information system owners, and information owners. The organization also considers
                  potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act
                  of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts
                  in categorizing the information system. As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy,
                  the organization considers partitioning higher-impact information systems into separate
                  physical domains (or environments) and restricting or prohibiting network access in
                  accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. NIST Special Publication 800-60
                  provides guidance on determining the security categories of the information types
                  resident on the information system. Related security controls: MP-4, SC-7.

 RA-2.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization conducts the security categorization of the information system as
                        an organization-wide exercise with the involvement of senior-level officials
                        including, but not limited to, authorizing officials, information system owners, chief
                        information officer, senior agency information security officer, and
                        mission/information owners;
                  (ii) the security categorization is consistent with FIPS 199 and considers the
                        provisional impact levels and special factors in NIST Special Publication 800-60;
                  (iii) the organization considers in the security categorization of the information system,
                        potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT
                        Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level
                        impacts;
                  (iv) the organization includes supporting rationale for impact-level decisions as part of
                        the security categorization; and
                  (v) designated, senior-level organizational officials review and approve the security
                        categorizations.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:
                  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; procedures addressing security categorization of
                           organizational information and information systems; security planning policy and

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 RA-3             RISK ASSESSMENT

                  Control: The organization conducts assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that
                  could result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
                  destruction of information and information systems that support the operations and assets
                  of the agency (including information and information systems managed/operated by
                  external parties).
                  Supplemental Guidance:  Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources,
                  and security controls planned or in place to determine the resulting level of residual risk
                  posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on the
                  operation of the information system. The organization also considers potential impacts to
                  other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland
                  Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the
                  information system. Risk assessments also take into account risk posed to organizational
                  operations, organizational assets, or individuals from external parties (e.g., service
                  providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization,
                  individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In
                  accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of
                  public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect
                  nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk
                  also address public access to federal information systems. The General Services
                  Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing with
                  public access to federal information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides
                  guidance on conducting risk assessments including threat, vulnerability, and impact
                  assessments.

 RA-3.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization assesses the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from the
                       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of
                       information and information systems that support its operations and assets
                       (including information and information systems managed/operated by external
                       parties); and
                  (ii) the risk assessment is consistent with the NIST Special Publication 800-30.

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 RA-4             RISK ASSESSMENT UPDATE

                  Control: The organization updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
                  frequency] or whenever there are significant changes to the information system, the
                  facilities where the system resides, or other conditions that may impact the security or
                  accreditation status of the system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization develops and documents specific criteria for
                  what is considered significant change to the information system. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessment updates.

 RA-4.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:

                        frequency of risk assessment updates;
                  (ii) the organization develops and documents specific criteria for what is considered
                        significant change to the information system, the facilities where the system resides,
                        or other conditions that may impact the security or accreditation status of the
                        system;
                  (iii) the organization updates the risk assessment in accordance with the organization-
                        defined frequency or whenever there are significant changes to the information
                        system, the facilities where the system resides, or other conditions that may impact
                        the security or accreditation status of the system; and
                  (iv) the risk assessment update is consistent with the NIST Special Publications 800-30.

 RA-5             VULNERABILITY SCANNING

                  Control: The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system [Assignment:
                  organization-defined frequency] or when significant new vulnerabilities potentially
                  affecting the system are identified and reported.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Vulnerability scanning is conducted using appropriate scanning
                  tools and techniques. The organization trains selected personnel in the use and
                  maintenance of vulnerability scanning tools and techniques. Vulnerability scans are
                  scheduled and/or random in accordance with organizational policy and assessment of risk.
                  The information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process is freely shared with
                  appropriate personnel throughout the organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities
                  in other information systems. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and applications
                  may require additional, more specialized approaches (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools for
                  applications, source code reviews, static analysis of source code). NIST Special
                  Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network security testing. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-40 (Version 2) provides guidance on patch and vulnerability
                  management.

 RA-5.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        frequency of vulnerability scans within the information system;
                  (ii) the organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system in accordance
                        with the organization-defined frequency and/or random in accordance with
                        organizational policy and assessment of risk, or when significant new vulnerabilities
                        potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;
                  (iii) the organization uses appropriate scanning tools and techniques to conduct the

 SA-4             ACQUISITIONS

                  Control: The organization includes security requirements and/or security specifications,
                  either explicitly or by reference, in information system acquisition contracts based on an
                  assessment of risk and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                  policies, regulations, and standards.
                  Supplemental Guidance:

                  Solicitation Documents
                  The solicitation documents (e.g., Requests for Proposals) for information systems and
                  services include, either explicitly or by reference, security requirements that describe: (i)
                  required security capabilities (security needs and, as necessary, specific security controls
                  and other specific FISMA requirements); (ii) required design and development processes;
                  (iii) required test and evaluation procedures; and (iv) required documentation. The
                  requirements in the solicitation documents permit updating security controls as new
                  threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented. NIST
                  Special Publication 800-36 provides guidance on the selection of information security
                  products. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on information technology
                  security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on security
                  considerations in the system development life cycle.
                  Information System Documentation
                  The solicitation documents include requirements for appropriate information system
                  documentation. The documentation addresses user and systems administrator guidance
                  and information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information
                  system. The level of detail required in the documentation is based on the FIPS 199
                  security category for the information system.
                  Use of Tested, Evaluated, and Validated Products
                  NIST Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on the acquisition and use of
                  tested/evaluated information technology products.
                  Configuration Settings and Implementation Guidance
                  The information system required documentation includes security configuration settings
                  and security implementation guidance. OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide
                  guidance on configuration requirements for federal information systems. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-70 provides guidance on configuration settings for information
                  technology products.

 SA-8             SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

                  Control: The organization designs and implements the information system using security
                  engineering principles.
                  Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-27 provides guidance on
                  engineering principles for information system security. The application of security
                  engineering principles is primarily targeted at new development information systems or
                  systems undergoing major upgrades and is integrated into the system development life
                  cycle. For legacy information systems, the organization applies security engineering
                  principles to system upgrades and modifications, to the extent feasible, given the current
                  state of the hardware, software, and firmware components within the system.

                                          ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 SA-9             EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES

                  Control: The organization: (i) requires that providers of external information system
                  services employ adequate security controls in accordance with applicable laws, Executive
                  Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and established service-level
                  agreements; and (ii) monitors security control compliance.
                  Supplemental Guidance: An external information system service is a service that is
                  implemented outside of the accreditation boundary of the organizational information
                  system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information
                  system). Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of
                  ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing
                  arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business
                  arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately, the
                  responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization’s operations and assets,
                  and to individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains
                  with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain
                  of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues
                  associated with information system security. For services external to the organization, a
                  chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that
                  each participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider
                  relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization.
                  Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or
                  service providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the
                  greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to individuals. The external
                  information system services documentation includes government, service provider, and
                  end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-
                  level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security
                  control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements
                  for any identified instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides
                  guidance on information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64
                  provides guidance on the security considerations in the system development life cycle.

 SA-9.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization requires that providers of external information system services
                       employ adequate security controls in accordance with applicable laws, Executive
                       Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and established
                       service-level agreements; and
                  (ii) the organization monitors security control compliance.

 SA-11            DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING

                  Control: The organization requires that information system developers create a security
                  test and evaluation plan, implement the plan, and document the results.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security test results are used to the greatest extent
                  feasible after verification of the results and recognizing that these results are impacted
                  whenever there have been security relevant modifications to the information system
                  subsequent to developer testing. Test results may be used in support of the security
                  certification and accreditation process for the delivered information system. Related

 SC-5             DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

                  Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following
                  types of denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of
                  denial of service attacks or reference to source for current list].
                  Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate
                  the effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can
                  filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network
                  from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Information systems that are

                  Control:   The information system limits the use of resources by priority.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Priority protection helps prevent a lower-priority process from
                  delaying or interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority process.

                                           ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 SC-7             BOUNDARY PROTECTION

                  Control:
                         The information system monitors and controls communications at the external
                  boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or
                  information systems, occur through managed interfaces consisting of appropriate
                  boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted
                  tunnels) arranged in an effective architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and
                  application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a
                  demilitarized zone or DMZ). Information system boundary protections at any designated
                  alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as that of the primary site.
                  As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning
                  higher-impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and
                  applying the concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit
                  network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199
                  security categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain
                  partitioning.
                  The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial
                  telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with
                  the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based
                  on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached
                  commercial customers, and may include third party provided access lines and other
                  service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting transmission services may
                  represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Therefore, when
                  this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate compensating
                  security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-
                  77 provides guidance on virtual private networks. Related security controls: MP-4, RA-2.

 SC-7.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines key internal boundaries of the information system; and
                  (ii) the information system monitors and controls communications at the external
                       boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the
                       system.

 SC-8             TRANSMISSION INTEGRITY

                  Control:   The information system protects the integrity of transmitted information.
                  Supplemental Guidance: If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
                  transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be
                  more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed
                  security controls for transmission integrity. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain
                  the necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through
                  appropriate contracting vehicles, the organization either implements appropriate

 SC-9             TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY

                  Control:   The information system protects the confidentiality of transmitted information.
                  Supplemental Guidance:   If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
                  transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be
                  more difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed
                  security controls for transmission confidentiality. When it is infeasible or impractical to
                  obtain the necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through
                  appropriate contracting vehicles, the organization either implements appropriate
                  compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-52 provides guidance on protecting transmission confidentiality using

 SC-20            SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)

                  Control: The information system that provides name/address resolution service provides
                  additional data origin and integrity artifacts along with the authoritative data it returns in
                  response to resolution queries.
                  Supplemental Guidance: This control enables remote clients to obtain origin authentication
                  and integrity verification assurances for the name/address resolution information obtained
                  through the service. A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an
                  information system that provides name/address resolution service; digital signatures and
                  cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts; and DNS resource records are
                  examples of authoritative data. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on
                  secure domain name system deployment.

 SC-20.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information system, (if the system provides a name/address resolution

 SC-22            ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

                  Control: The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution
                  service for an organization are fault tolerant and implement role separation.
                  Supplemental Guidance: A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an
                  information system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single
                  points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative
                  domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as
                  secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network
                  subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). If
                  organizational information technology resources are divided into those resources
                  belonging to internal networks and those resources belonging to external networks,
                  authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are established. The
                  DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information
                  pertaining to both internal and external information technology resources while the DNS
                  server with the external role only provides name/address resolution information
                  pertaining to external information technology resources. The list of clients who can
                  access the authoritative DNS server of a particular role is also specified. NIST Special
                  Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure DNS deployment.

 SC-22.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution
                  service for an organization are fault tolerant and implement role separation.

 SC-23            SESSION AUTHENTICITY

                  Control: The information system provides mechanisms to protect the authenticity of
                  communications sessions.
                  Supplemental Guidance: This control focuses on communications protection at the session,
                  versus packet, level. The intent of this control is to implement session-level protection
                  where needed (e.g., in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services).
                  NIST Special Publication 800-52 provides guidance on the use of transport layer security
                  (TLS) mechanisms. NIST Special Publication 800-77 provides guidance on the
                  deployment of IPsec virtual private networks (VPNs) and other methods of protecting
                  communications sessions. NIST Special Publication 800-95 provides guidance on secure
                  web services.

 SI-2             FLAW REMEDIATION

                  Control: The organization identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws.

                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization identifies information systems containing
                  software affected by recently announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities
                  resulting from those flaws). The organization (or the software developer/vendor in the
                  case of software developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs
                  newly released security relevant patches, service packs, and hot fixes, and tests patches,
                  service packs, and hot fixes for effectiveness and potential side effects on the
                  organization’s information systems before installation. Flaws discovered during security
                  assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system
                  error handling are also addressed expeditiously. Flaw remediation is incorporated into
                  configuration management as an emergency change. NIST Special Publication 800-40
                  provides guidance on security patch installation and patch management. Related security
                  controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-7, CM-3, IR-4, SI-11.

 SI-3             MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION

                  Control: The information system implements malicious code protection.

                  Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms
                  at critical information system entry and exit points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers,
                  web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers) and at workstations, servers, or mobile
                  computing devices on the network. The organization uses the malicious code protection
                  mechanisms to detect and eradicate malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
                  spyware) transported: (i) by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet
                  accesses, removable media (e.g., USB devices, diskettes or compact disks), or other
                  common means; or (ii) by exploiting information system vulnerabilities. The
                  organization updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including the latest virus
                  definitions) whenever new releases are available in accordance with organizational
                  configuration management policy and procedures. The organization considers using
                  malicious code protection software products from multiple vendors (e.g., using one
                  vendor for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations). The
                  organization also considers the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection
                  and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information
                  system. NIST Special Publication 800-83 provides guidance on implementing malicious
                  code protection.

 SI-3.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information system implements malicious code protection by verifying
                  that:
                  - the organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms at critical
                       information system entry and exit points, and at workstations, servers, or mobile
                       computing devices on the network to detect and eradicate malicious code;
                  - the malicious code protection mechanisms detect and eradicate malicious code
                       transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet access,
                       removable media, or other common means, or by exploiting information system
                       vulnerabilities;
                  - the organization updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new
                       releases are available, to include the latest malicious code definitions, in accordance

 SI-4             INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

                  Control: The organization employs tools and techniques to monitor events on the
                  information system, detect attacks, and provide identification of unauthorized use of the
                  system.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a
                  variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention
                  systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network
                  monitoring software). Monitoring devices are strategically deployed within the
                  information system (e.g., at selected perimeter locations, near server farms supporting
                  critical applications) to collect essential information. Monitoring devices are also
                  deployed at ad hoc locations within the system to track specific transactions.
                  Additionally, these devices are used to track the impact of security changes to the
                  information system. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the
                  organization based upon its monitoring objectives and the capability of the information
                  system to support such activities. Organizations consult appropriate legal counsel with
                  regard to all information system monitoring activities. Organizations heighten the level
                  of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased
                  risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on law
                  enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of
                  information. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides guidance on detecting attacks
                  through various types of security technologies. NIST Special Publication 800-83
                  provides guidance on detecting malware-based attacks through malicious code protection
                  software. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on monitoring and
                  analyzing computer security event logs. NIST Special Publication 800-94 provides
                  guidance on intrusion detection and prevention. Related security control: AC-8.

 SI-6             SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

                  Control: The information system verifies the correct operation of security functions
                  [Selection (one or more): upon system startup and restart, upon command by user with
                  appropriate privilege, periodically every [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]]
                  and [Selection (one or more): notifies system administrator, shuts the system down,
                  restarts the system] when anomalies are discovered.
                  Supplemental Guidance: The need to verify security functionality applies to all security
                  functions. For those security functions that are not able to execute automated self-tests,
                  the organization either implements compensating security controls or explicitly accepts
                  the risk of not performing the verification as required.

 SI-6.1           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if:
                  (i) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, the
                        appropriate conditions for conducting security function verification;
                  (ii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, for periodic
                        security function verification, the frequency of the verifications;
                  (iii) the organization defines in the security plan, explicitly or by reference, information
                        system responses to anomalies discovered during security function verification;
                  (iv) the information system verifies the correct operation of security functions in
                        accordance with organization-defined conditions and in accordance with
                        organization-defined frequency (if periodic verification); and
                  (v) the information system responds to security function anomalies in accordance with
                        organization-defined responses.

 SI-10            INFORMATION ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, VALIDITY, AND AUTHENTICITY

                  Control: The information system checks information for accuracy, completeness, validity,
                  and authenticity.
                  Supplemental Guidance: Checks for accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of
                  information are accomplished as close to the point of origin as possible. Rules for
                  checking the valid syntax of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length,
                  numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify that inputs match specified
                  definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to
                  prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. The extent to
                  which the information system is able to check the accuracy, completeness, validity, and
                  authenticity of information is guided by organizational policy and operational
                  requirements.

 SI-10.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                  Determine if the information system checks information for accuracy, completeness,
                  validity, and authenticity by verifying that the system:
                  - checks for accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of information is
                       accomplished as close to the point of origin as possible;
                  - employs rules to check the valid syntax of information inputs to verify that inputs
                       match specified definitions for format and content;
                  - prescreens information inputs passed to interpreters to prevent the content from
                       being unintentionally interpreted as commands; and
                  - checks the accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of information to the
                       extent guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
                  POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS:

Section II: Extended Assessment Procedure


                                           EXTENDED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE

 EAP           The extended assessment procedure (EAP) and the associated assessment objectives complement the
               other assessment procedures in this catalog. The EAP is employed to verify compliance with the
               assurance requirements in Special Publication 800-53. The EAP is applied on an assessment by
               assessment basis according to how the organization chose to satisfy the assurance requirements in
               Special Publication 800-53 for the information system under assessment. For example, the EAP can
               be applied on a per control basis, per control family basis, per system basis, or per organization basis.
               Organizations retain maximum flexibility in how assessors apply the EAP and should describe its
               specific application in the security assessment plan.

APPENDIX G

PENETRATION TESTING
ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY INFORMATION SYSTEM WEAKNESSES




O        rganizations should consider adding controlled penetration testing to their arsenal of tools
         and techniques used to assess the security controls in the information system.
         Penetration testing is a specific type of assessment methodology in which assessors
simulate the actions of a given class of attacker by using a defined set of documentation (that is,
the documentation representative of what that class of attacker is likely to possess) and working
under other specific constraints to attempt to circumvent the security features of an information
system. Penetration testing is conducted as a controlled attempt to breach the security controls
employed within the information system using the attacker’s techniques and appropriate hardware
and software tools. Penetration testing represents the results of a specific assessor or group of
assessors at a specific point in time using agreed-upon rules of engagement. As such, and
considering the complexity of the information technologies commonly employed by
organizations today, penetration testing should be viewed not as a means to verify the security of
an information system, but rather as a means to: (i) enhance the organization’s understanding of
the system; (ii) uncover some weaknesses or deficiencies in the system; and (iii) indicate the level
of effort required on the part of adversaries to breach the system safeguards. 60

Keeping in mind reasonable expectations toward penetration testing results, organizations should
consider performing controlled penetration testing on moderate-impact and high-impact
information systems. Penetration testing exercises can be scheduled and/or random in accordance
with organizational policy and organizational assessments of risk. Consideration should be given
to performing penetration tests: (i) on any newly developed information system (or legacy system
undergoing a major upgrade) before the system is authorized for operation; (ii) after important
changes are made to the environment in which the information system operates; and (iii) when a
new type of attack is discovered that may impact the system. Organizations actively monitor the
information systems environment and the threat landscape (e.g., new vulnerabilities, attack
techniques, new technology deployments, user security awareness and training) to identify
changes that require out-of-cycle penetration testing.

Organizations specify which components within the information system are subject to penetration
testing and the attacker’s profile to be adopted throughout the penetration testing exercises.
Organizations train selected personnel in the use and maintenance of penetration testing tools and
techniques. Effective penetration testing tools should have the capability to readily update the list
of attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used during the exercises. Organizations
should update the list of attack techniques and exploitable vulnerabilities used in penetration
testing in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk or when significant new
vulnerabilities or threats are identified and reported. Whenever possible, organizations should
employ tools and attack techniques that include the capability to perform penetration testing
exercises on information systems and security controls in an automated manner.

The information obtained from the penetration testing process should be shared with appropriate
personnel throughout the organization to help prioritize the vulnerabilities in the information

60
  The failure of an assessor or group of assessors to penetrate an information system may be more indicative of team
expertise, resources applied, or hindrance by rules of engagement than a statement of overall system security.

system that are demonstrably subject to compromise by attackers of a profile equivalent to the
ones used in the penetration testing exercises. The prioritization helps to determine effective
strategies for eliminating the identified vulnerabilities and mitigating associated risks to the
organization’s operations and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, and to the Nation
resulting from the operation and use of the information system. Penetration testing should be
integrated into the network security testing process and the patch and vulnerability management
process. NIST Special Publication 800-40 (Version 2) provides guidance on patch and
vulnerability management. NIST Special Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network
security testing. NIST Special Publication 800-115 provides guidance on information security
testing.

Penetration Testing Considerations
Organizations should consider the following in developing and implementing a controlled
penetration testing program:
    •    An effective penetration test goes beyond vulnerability scanning, to provide an explicit
         and often dramatic proof of mission risks and an indicator of the level of effort an
         adversary would need to expend in order to cause harm to the organization’s operations
         and assets, to individuals, to other organizations, or to the Nation;
    •    An effective penetration test approaches the information system as the adversary would,
         considering vulnerabilities, incorrect system configurations, trust relationships between
         organizations, and architectural weaknesses in the environment under test;
    •    An effective penetration test has a clearly defined scope and contains as a minimum:
         - A definition of the environment subject to test (e.g., facilities, users, organizational
           groups, etc.);
         - A definition of the attack surface to be tested (e.g., servers, desktop systems, wireless
           networks, web applications, intrusion detection and prevention systems, firewalls, email
           accounts, user security awareness and training posture, incident response posture, etc.);
         - A definition of the threat sources to simulate (e.g., an enumeration of attacker’s profiles
           to be used: internal attacker, casual attacker, single or group of external targeted
           attackers, criminal organization, etc.);
         - A definition of level of effort (time and resources) to be expended; and
         - A definition of the rules of engagement.
    •    An effective penetration test thoroughly documents all activities performed during the
         test, including all exploited vulnerabilities, and how the vulnerabilities were combined
         into attacks;
    •    An effective penetration test produces results indicating a risk level for a given attacker
         by using the level of effort the team needed to expend in penetrating the information
         system as an indicator of the penetration resistance of the system;
    •    An effective penetration test validates existing security controls (including risk mitigation
         mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems);
    •    An effective penetration test provides a verifiable and reproducible log of all the
         activities performed during the test; and
    •    An effective penetration test provides actionable results with information about possible
         remediation measures for the successful attacks performed.

ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE WORK SHEET
IDENTIFYING AND SELECTING THE BASE SET OF ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES FOR TAILORING




T       he work sheet provided in this appendix summarizes all of the assessment procedures and
        associated assessment objectives listed in Appendix F (Assessment Procedure Catalog) by
        NIST Special Publication 800-53 security control/control enhancement identifier. This
work sheet is intended to assist users of this document in identifying and selecting the base set of
procedures for assessing the information system security controls. The base set of assessment
procedures requires tailoring as appropriate (see Section 3.3) to reflect the security controls
defined and documented in the security plan and to support the type of security assessment being
conducted. The first column of the work sheet can be used by organizations to identify the
security controls and control enhancements that are contained in the security plan for the
information system. 61 The second column can be used to identify which security controls are part
of the current assessment if the organization is conducting a partial assessment (for example,
conducting an assessment as part of continuous monitoring where a subset of the security controls
are assessed on an ongoing basis). The third and fourth columns list all of the security controls
(and control enhancements) in Special Publication 800-53 by shorthand identifier and formal
control name, respectively. The fifth column lists all of the assessment objectives for each
assessment procedure in Appendix F. The set of procedures to be tailored and used in assessing
the security controls in the organizational information system correspond to the security controls
and security control enhancements checked in the first column (or second column for partial
assessments). Assessment procedures developed for the assessment of organization-specific or
system-specific controls not listed in Appendix F must also be executed. A section of the work
sheet is reserved for listing these additional security controls.




61
   The security plan column can also be used to indicate whether the security control is a system-specific control,
common control, or a hybrid control. For common controls, a notation should also be made as to the FIPS 199 impact

APPENDIX I

SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORTS
DOCUMENTING THE FINDINGS FROM SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSMENTS




T        he primary purpose of the security assessment report is to convey the results of the
         security assessment to appropriate organizational officials. 62 The security assessment
         report provides a disciplined and structured approach for documenting the findings of the
assessor and the recommendations for correcting any weaknesses or deficiencies in the security
controls. 63 This appendix provides a template for reporting the results from security control
assessments. Organizations are not restricted to the specific template format; however, it is
anticipated that the overall report of an assessment will include similar information to that
detailed in the template for each security control assessed, preceded by a summary providing the
list of all security controls assessed and the overall status of each control.

Key Elements for Assessment Reporting
The following elements should be included in security assessment reports:
•    Information System Name and Impact Level
•    Site(s) Assessed and Assessment Date(s)
•    Security Control or Control Enhancement and Associated Supplemental Guidance
•    For Each Assessment Objective (determination statements):
     - Assessment Methods and Objects
     - Assessment Finding Summary (indicating satisfied or other than satisfied)
•    Assessor Comments (weaknesses or deficiencies noted)
•    Assessor Recommendations (remediation, corrective actions, or improvements)




62
  The security assessment report is included in the security accreditation package along with the information system
security plan (including updated risk assessment), and the plan of action and milestones to provide authorizing officials
with the information necessary to make credible, risk-based decisions on whether to place an information system into
operation or continue its operation. As the security certification and accreditation process becomes more dynamic in
nature, relying to a greater degree on the continuous monitoring aspects of the process as an integrated and tightly
coupled part of the system development life cycle, the ability to update the security assessment report frequently
becomes a critical aspect of an information security program. It is important to emphasize the relationship, described in
NIST Special Publication 800-37, among the three key documents in the accreditation package (i.e., the system security
plan including risk assessment, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones). It is these
documents that provide the best indication of the overall security status of the information system and the ability of the
system to protect, to the degree necessary, the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation. Updates to these key documents should be provided on an ongoing basis in accordance with the
continuous monitoring program established by the organization.
63
   While the rationale for each determination made is a part of the formal Security Assessment Report, the complete set
of records produced as a part of the assessment is likely not included in the report. However, organizations should
retain the portion of these records necessary for maintaining an audit trail of assessment evidence, facilitating reuse of
evidence as appropriate, and promoting repeatability of assessor actions.

The Assessment Findings
Each determination statement executed by an assessor results in one of the following findings: (i)
satisfied (S); or (ii) other than satisfied (O). Consider the following example for security control
CP-1. The assessment procedure for CP-1 consists of two assessment objectives denoted CP-1.1
and CP-1.2. The assessor initially executes CP-1.1 and produces the following findings:

 CP-1.1          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                 Determine if:
                 (i) the organization develops and documents contingency planning policy and
                       procedures; (S)
                 (ii) the organization disseminates contingency planning policy and procedures to
                       appropriate elements within the organization; (O)
                 (iii) responsible parties within the organization periodically review contingency
                       planning policy and procedures; and (S)
                 (iv) the organization updates contingency planning policy and procedures when
                       organizational review indicates updates are required. (O)
                 Comments and Recommendations:
                 CP-1.1(ii) is marked as other than satisfied because there was insufficient evidence to
                 determine if the following two of the ten identified organizational elements on the distribution
                 list for the contingency planning policy and procedures actually had received the policy and
                 procedures: (i) organization physical security office; and (ii) organization finance and
                 accounting office. Straightforward remediation action recommended of providing necessary
                 documentation to the two organizational elements not receiving the policy and procedures.
                 CP-1.1 (iv) is marked as other than satisfied because over fifty percent of the contingency
                 planning policy and procedure documents identified as requiring updates had not in fact been
                 updated. Significant remediation action is recommended to correct clear process deficiencies.


In a similar manner, the assessor executes CP-1.2 and produces the following findings:

 CP-1.2          ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE:
                 Determine if:
                 (i) the contingency planning policy addresses purpose, scope, roles and
                       responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
                       entities, and compliance; (S)
                 (ii) the contingency planning policy is consistent with the organization’s mission and
                       functions and with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                       guidance; and (S)
                 (iii) the contingency planning procedures address all areas identified in the contingency
                       planning policy and address achieving policy-compliant implementations of all
                       associated contingency planning controls. (O)
                 Comments and Recommendations:
                 CP-1.2(iii) is marked as other than satisfied because the assessment team could not make a
                 determination. The entire suite of updated contingency planning procedures (identified in CP-
                 1.1(iv) finding) was unavailable and therefore, the sufficiency of contingency planning policy
                 coverage could not be determined. Further investigation is needed.


During an actual security control assessment, the assessment findings, comments, and
recommendations would be documented on the Security Assessment Reporting Form provided in
this appendix.

APPENDIX J

ASSESSMENT CASES
WORKED EXAMPLES OF ASSESSOR ACTIONS DERIVED FROM ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES




T      o provide assessors with additional tools and techniques for implementing the assessment
       procedures in Appendix F, NIST initiated the Assessment Case Development Project. 64
       The purpose of the project is threefold: (i) actively engage experienced assessors from
multiple organizations in recommending assessment cases that describe specific assessor actions
to implement the assessment procedures in Appendix F; (ii) provide organizations and the
assessors supporting those organizations with an exemplary set of assessment cases for each
assessment procedure in Appendix F; and (iii) provide a vehicle for ongoing community-wide
review of and comment on the assessment cases to promote continuous improvement in the
security control assessment process for more consistent, effective, and cost-effective security
assessments of federal information systems. The assessment case development process is
described in this appendix and several examples of assessment cases are provided.

Assessment Case Description and Template
The concept of assessment cases emerged during the development process of NIST Special
Publication 800-53A. Some organizations prefer the flexibility offered by the generalized
assessment procedures in Appendix F, with the opportunity to tailor the procedures for specific
organizational requirements and operational environments and to create specific assessor actions
and activities for a particular security assessment. Other organizations prefer a more prescriptive
approach and desire, to the greatest extent possible, a predefined set of specific assessor actions
and activities needed to successfully carry out a security assessment. To facilitate the specificity
of the latter approach while maintaining the flexibility of the former approach, assessment cases
have been developed for all assessment procedures in Appendix F of this document.

An assessment case represents a worked example of an assessment procedure, identifying the
specific actions that an assessor might carry out during the assessment of a security control or
control enhancement in an information system. There is one assessment case per control,
covering all assessment objectives from the assessment procedure in Appendix F for that control
(both base control and all enhancements). The assessment case provides an example by
experienced assessors of a potential set of specific assessor action steps to accomplish the
assessment that were developed with consideration for the list of potential assessment methods
and objects, along with impact-level designations, and incorporating the level of coverage and
depth to be applied and the specific purpose to be achieved by each assessor action. This
additional level of detail in the assessment cases provides assessors with more prescriptive
assessment information. Yet, while being more prescriptive, the assessment cases are not
intended to restrict assessor flexibility provided as part of the design principles in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A. The assessor remains responsible for making the specified determinations
and for providing adequate rationale for the determinations made.



64
  NIST initiated the Assessment Case Development Project in October 2007 in cooperation with the Departments of
Justice, Energy, Transportation, and the Intelligence Community. The interagency task force developed a full suite of
assessment cases based on the assessment procedures provided in NIST Special Publication 800-53A. The assessment
cases are available to all public and private sector organizations and can be downloaded from the NIST web site at
http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.

The following template is used to create the specific assessment cases for the assessment
procedures in Appendix F.

                         This section provides some initial suggestions with regard to sequencing of assessor actions for
                         greater efficiency. Precursor controls are those controls whose assessment is likely to provide
                         information either assisting in, or required for, the assessment of this control. Concurrent
                         controls are those controls whose assessment is likely to require the assessor to assess similar
                         objects and hence, the assessor may be able to obtain evidence for multiple control assessments
                         at the same time. Successor controls are those controls whose assessment will likely need, or
                         benefit from, information obtained from the assessment of this control.

  The assessment cases developed for this project are not the only acceptable assessment cases; rather,
  the cases represent one possible set of assessor actions for organizations (and assessors supporting
  those organizations) to use in helping to determine the effectiveness of the security controls employed
  within the information systems undergoing assessments. The following assessment procedure for
  security control AC-3, illustrates how assessment cases are developed from the template on the

                                            (i) have the capability to enforce access authorizations (access restrictions);
                                            and (ii) are configured in compliance with the intended user authorizations
                                            (assigned authorizations).
                                            In order for AC-3.1.1 to receive a satisfied determination, it cannot be
                                            completed unless AC-3.1.2 is also satisfied. In the context of this
                                            assessment case, assigned authorizations” is synonymous with “applicable
                                            policy”.
                                            Documented user (and process) authorizations may also be found in
                                            concurrent controls.
 AC-3.1.1.1                   LMH           Examine access control policy, procedures addressing access enforcement,
                                            information system design documentation, information system security plan,
                                            or other relevant documents; reviewing for the mechanisms to be employed
                                            to enforce assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system.
                                            Note to Assessor: This assessor action is to identify the mechanisms that
                                            should exist and the parameters the mechanisms should enforce; not to
                                            assess the validity of assigned authorizations.
 AC-3.1.1.2                   LMH           Examine an agreed-upon, representative sample of mechanisms identified in
                                            AC-3.1.1.1; inspecting for indication that the mechanisms identified in AC-
                                            3.1.1.1 are employed.
 AC-3.1.2.1                   LMH           Examine an agreed-upon, representative sample of information system
                                            configuration settings for the sample of mechanisms examined in AC-
                                            3.1.1.2; reviewing to verify that the user privileges on the information
                                            system are consistent with the documented user authorizations.
