Executive Summary

WiMAX 1 technology is a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) communications technology that
is largely based on the wireless interface defined in the IEEE 802.16 standard. The industry trade
association, the WiMAX Forum, coined the WiMAX trademark and defines the precise content and scope
of WiMAX technology through technical specifications that it creates and publishes. 2 The original
purpose of IEEE 802.16 technology was to provide last-mile broadband wireless access as an alternative
to cable, digital subscriber line-, or T1 service. Developments in the IEEE 802.16 standard shifted the
technology’s focus toward a more cellular-like, mobile architecture to serve a broader market. Today,
WiMAX technology continues to adapt to market demands and provide enhanced user mobility. This
document discusses WiMAX wireless communication topologies, components, certifications, security
features, and related security concerns.

The IEEE amendment that enabled mobile WiMAX operations is IEEE 802.16e-2005. Prior to its release,
deployment of WiMAX networks was limited to fixed operations by the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard.
Additionally, IEEE 802.16e-2005 provided significant security enhancements to its predecessor by
incorporating more robust mutual authentication mechanisms, as well as support for Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). Although the IEEE 802.16-2004 and 802.16e-2005 standards were released
within a year of each other, IEEE 802.16e-2005 product certification did not start until 2008, and IEEE
802.16-2004 products are still used in today’s information technology (IT) environments. The most
recently ratified standard is IEEE 802.16-2009, which consolidated IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-
2005, and other IEEE 802.16 amendments from 2004 through 2008. IEEE also released IEEE 802.16j-
2009 to specify multi-hop relay networking. This publication addresses IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE
802.16e-2005, IEEE 802.16-2009, and IEEE 802.16j-2009.

WiMAX wireless interface threats focus on compromising the radio links between WiMAX nodes. These
radio links support both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation. Links from
LOS WiMAX systems are generally harder to attack than those from NLOS systems because an
adversary would have to physically locate equipment between the transmitting nodes to compromise the
confidentiality or integrity of the wireless link. WiMAX NLOS systems provide wireless coverage over
large geographic regions, which expands the potential staging areas for both clients and adversaries. Like
other networking technologies, all WiMAX systems must address threats arising from denial of service
attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation.

To improve WiMAX system security, organizations should implement the following recommendations:

Organizations should develop a robust WMAN security policy and enforce it.

A security policy is an organization’s foundation for designing, implementing, and maintaining properly
secured technologies. WMAN policy should address the design and operation of the technical
infrastructure and the behavior of users. Client devices should be configured to comply with WMAN
policies, such as disabling unneeded services and altering default configurations. In addition, policy-
driven software solutions can be implemented on client devices to prevent or allow certain actions to take
place when specific conditions are met. Policy-driven software helps ensure that client devices and users
comply with an organization’s defined policies.

Organizations should assess WiMAX technical countermeasures before implementing a vendor’s
WiMAX technology.

As of this writing, few WiMAX products employ Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
validated cryptographic modules. Consequently, vendors often integrate their WiMAX products with
other security solutions that meet FIPS requirements. WiMAX interoperability certifications do not
extend to these add-on approaches, which means there may be no assurance that the vendor’s offering
will function as intended. Given the diversity in potential approaches and the risk that integration issues
could affect the security of the system, organizations should work closely with WiMAX vendors to gain a
better understanding of potential system configuration constraints. Organizations should independently
determine the need for compensating controls to address technical security functionality that the WiMAX
product may not address.

Organizations using WiMAX technology should require mutual authentication for WiMAX
devices.

WiMAX technology supports mutual device authentication between a base station (BS) and a user’s
subscriber unit (i.e., mobile phone, laptop, or similar device), but the feature must be activated to realize
the benefit of the approach. Organizations should strongly consider WiMAX solutions capable of
supporting Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods for mutual authentication as recommended
in NIST SP 800-120, Recommendation for EAP Methods Used in Wireless Network Access
Authentication. 3 EAP methods that support mutual device authentication typically also support integrated
user authentication using passwords, smart cards, biometrics, or some combination of these mechanisms.
WiMAX solutions that cannot meet these criteria should employ a different means of authentication at a
higher layer (e.g., encryption overlay or virtual private network [VPN]). Specifically, native IEEE
802.16-2004 authentication does not support mutual device authentication and thus should be avoided.

Organizations using WiMAX networks should implement FIPS-validated encryption algorithms
employing FIPS-validated cryptographic modules to protect data communications.

WiMAX communications consist of management and data messages. Management messages are used to
govern communications parameters necessary to maintain wireless links, and data messages carry the data
to be transmitted over wireless links. Encryption is not applied to management messages to increase the
efficiency of network operations, while data messages are encrypted natively in accordance with the IEEE
standards. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 support the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
(as documented in FIPS Publication 197), whereas IEEE 802.16-2004 supports Data Encryption Standard
in Cipher Block Chaining mode (DES-CBC). DES-CBC has several well-documented weaknesses,
making it a vulnerable encryption algorithm that should not be used to protect data messages. Federal
agency communications that require protection through encryption must use products with cryptographic
functionality that is validated under the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), as
meeting requirements per FIPS PUB 140. For WiMAX solutions that do not support FIPS-validated
algorithms employing FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, organizations needing to protect the
confidentiality of their WiMAX communications should deploy overlay encryption solutions, such as a
FIPS-validated virtual private network solution.

binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2     Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide information to organizations regarding the security
capabilities of wireless communications using WiMAX networks and to provide recommendations on
using these capabilities. WiMAX technology is a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN)
technology based upon the IEEE 802.16 standard. It is used for a variety of purposes, including, but not
limited to, fixed last-mile broadband access, long-range wireless backhaul, and access layer technology
for mobile wireless subscribers operating on telecommunications networks.

The scope of this document is limited to the security of the WiMAX air interface and user subscriber
devices, to include: security services for device and user authentication; data confidentiality; data
integrity; and replay protection. This document does not address WiMAX network system specifications,
which address core network infrastructure and are primarily employed by commercial network operators. 4
This publication, while containing requirements specific to Federal agencies, serves to provide security
guidance for organizations considering the implementation of WiMAX systems.

2.       Overview of WiMAX Technology

A wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) is a form of wireless networking that has an intended
coverage area—a range—of approximately the size of a city. A WMAN is typically owned by a single
entity such as an Internet service provider, government entity, or large corporation. Access to a WMAN is
usually restricted to authorized users and subscriber devices.

The most widely deployed form of WMAN technology is WiMAX technology, which is based in large
part on the IEEE 802.16 standard. The industry trade association, the WiMAX Forum 5 , coined the
WiMAX trademark and defines the precise content and scope of WiMAX technology through technical
specifications that it creates and publishes. Early iterations of WiMAX technology (based on IEEE
802.16-2004 and earlier) were designed to provide fixed last-mile broadband wireless access. The IEEE
802.16e-2005 amendment added support for enhanced user mobility. The latest standard, IEEE 802.16-
2009, consolidates IEEE 802.16-2004 and IEEE 802.16e-2005 in addition to IEEE 802.16 amendments
approved between 2004 and 2008. IEEE also released IEEE 802.16j-2009 to specify multi-hop relay
networking. This section explains the fundamental concepts of WiMAX technology, including its
topologies, and discusses the evolution of the IEEE 802.16 standard.

2.1      Fundamental WiMAX Concepts

WiMAX networks have five fundamental architectural components:

 Base Station (BS). The BS is the node that logically connects wireless subscriber devices to operator
  networks. The BS maintains communications with subscriber devices and governs access to the
  operator networks. A BS consists of the infrastructure elements necessary to enable wireless
  communications, i.e., antennas, transceivers, and other electromagnetic wave transmitting equipment.
  BSs are typically fixed nodes, but they may also be used as part of mobile solutions—for example, a
  BS may be affixed to a vehicle to provide communications for nearby WiMAX devices. A BS also
  serves as a Master Relay-Base Station in the multi-hop relay topology (described in Section 2.2).
 Subscriber Station (SS). The SS is a stationary WiMAX-capable radio system that communicates
  with a base station, although it may also connect to a relay station in multi-hop relay network
  operations (described in Section 2.2).
 Mobile Station (MS). An MS is an SS that is intended to be used while in motion at up to vehicular
  speeds. Compared with fixed (stationary) SSs, MSs typically are battery operated and therefore
  employ enhanced power management. Example MSs include WiMAX radios embedded in laptops
  and mobile phones. This document uses the term SS/MS to refer to the class of both MS and

      In a strict reading of the IEEE 802.16 standards, an SS can refer to both an MS and a stationary (location-fixed) SS.
      However, many WiMAX documents refer to SS as fixed stations only. The term SS/MS clarifies this ambiguity by
      explicitly indicating that it refers to either fixed or mobile stations.

      connectivity service network (IP connectivity). 7 WiMAX devices communicate using two wireless
      message types: management messages and data messages. Data messages transport data across the
      WiMAX network. Management messages are used to maintain communications between an SS/MS
      and BS, e.g., establishing communication parameters, exchanging security settings, and performing
      system registration events (initial network entry, handoffs, etc.)
IEEE 802.16 defines frequency bands for operations based on signal propagation type. In one type, it
employs a radio frequency (RF) beam to propagate signals between nodes. Propagation over this beam is
highly sensitive to RF obstacles, so an unobstructed view between nodes is needed. This type of signal
propagation, called line-of-sight (LOS), is limited to fixed operations and uses the 10 to 66 gigahertz
(GHz) frequency range. The other type of signal propagation is called non-line-of-sight (NLOS). NLOS
employs advanced RF modulation techniques to compensate for RF signal changes caused by obstacles
that would prevent LOS communications. NLOS can be used for both fixed WiMAX operations (below
11 GHz) and mobile operations (below 6 GHz). NLOS signal propagation is more commonly employed
than LOS because of obstacles that interfere with LOS communications and because of strict regulations
for frequency licensing and antenna deployment in many environments that hinder the feasibility of using
LOS.

2.2     Operating Topologies

There are four primary topologies for IEEE 802.16 networks: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, multi-
hop relay, and mobile. Each of these topologies is briefly described below.

2.2.1     Point-to-Point (P2P)

A point-to-point (P2P) topology consists of a dedicated long-range, high-capacity wireless link between
two sites. Typically, the main or central site hosts the BS, and the remote site hosts the SS, as seen in
Figure 2-1. The BS controls the communications and security parameters for establishing the link with the
SS. The P2P topology is used for high-bandwidth wireless backhaul 8 services at a maximum operating
range of approximately 48 kilometers (km) (30 miles) using LOS signal propagation, and eight km (five
miles) using NLOS.

      A backhaul is typically a high capacity line from a remote site or network to a central site or network.

2.2.2   Point-to-Multipoint (PMP)

A point-to-multipoint (PMP) topology is composed of a central BS supporting multiple SSs, providing
network access from one location to many. It is commonly used for last-mile broadband access, 9 private
enterprise connectivity to remote offices, and long-range wireless backhaul services for multiple sites.
PMP networks can operate using LOS or NLOS signal propagation. Each PMP BS has a maximum
operating range of 8 km (5 miles), but it is typically less than this due to cell configuration and the urban
density of the target coverage area. Figure 2-2 illustrates the PMP topology.

    Last-mile broadband access refers to communications technology that bridges the transmission distance between the
    broadband service provider infrastructure and the customer premises equipment.

                                        Figure 2-2. PMP Topology

2.2.3   Multi-Hop Relay

A multi-hop relay topology, defined by IEEE 802.16j-2009, extends a BS’s coverage area by permitting
SSs/MSs to relay traffic by acting as RSs. Data destined to an SS/MS outside of the BS’s range is relayed
through adjacent RSs. An RS can only forward traffic to RSs/SSs within its Security Zone. A Security
Zone is a set of trusted relationships between a BS and a group of RSs. Data originating outside of a BS’s
coverage area is routed over multiple RSs, increasing the network’s total geographical coverage area, as
seen in Figure 2-3. Multi-hop relay topology typically uses NLOS signal propagation because its purpose
is to span large geographic areas containing multiple RF obstacles; however, technically it can operate
using LOS propagation as well. The maximum operating range for each node in a multi-hop relay
topology is approximately 8 km (5 miles), but the actual operating range is typically less depending on
environmental conditions (e.g., building obstructions) and antenna configuration.

                                     Figure 2-3. Multi-Hop Topology

2.2.4   Mobile

A mobile topology is similar to a cellular network because multiple BSs collaborate to provide seamless
communications over a distributed network to both SSs and MSs. This topology combines the coverage
area of each member BS and includes measures to facilitate handoffs of MSs between BS coverage areas,
as seen by the car MS in Figure 2-4. It uses advanced RF signaling technology to support the increased
RF complexity required for mobile operations. Each BS coverage area is approximately 8 km (5 miles).
Mobile WiMAX systems operate using NLOS signal propagation on frequencies below 6 GHz.

2.3      Evolution of the IEEE 802.16 Standard

In 1999, the 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access Standards was established to develop
standards and recommended practices to support the development and deployment of broadband WMAN.
The following summarizes the standards and amendments that the working group has produced.

When the IEEE 802.16-2001 standard, which targeted last-mile broadband wireless access, was first
under development in 2001, the WiMAX Forum formed to promote the compatibility and interoperability
of IEEE 802.16 technologies. In December 2001, the IEEE 802.16-2001 standard was approved. It
operated in the 10–66 GHz frequency range and provided LOS fixed P2P and PMP communications at
maximum data rates of approximately 70 megabits per second (Mbps). Implementation of the IEEE
802.16-2001 standard was limited because of its LOS requirement and lack of available spectrum.
Because of the shortcomings of IEEE 802.16-2001, an amendment, IEEE 802.16a, was released during
2003. This amendment improved interoperability, quality of service (QoS), and data performance. It also
provided the ability to propagate signals from one active device to another and to have NLOS
communications. An IEEE 802.16d amendment was also under development to improve interoperability,
but it was later transitioned from a single amendment to a revision project that aggregated IEEE 802.16-
2001 and its amendments under a single standard: IEEE 802.16-2004. Versions of IEEE 802.16 prior to
IEEE 802.16-2004 are no longer supported by vendors and are not discussed further in this publication.

IEEE 802.16-2004 combines all of the improved functionality of the IEEE 802.16-2001 amendments with
new interoperability specifications. The standard supports communications in the 2–66 GHz frequency
range, with 10–66 GHz for LOS and 2–11 GHz for NLOS. Each frequency range employs different
modulation techniques to accommodate LOS and NLOS communications requirements. Additionally,
IEEE 802.16-2004 can operate in P2P and PMP topologies.

The IEEE 802.16e-2005 amendment to the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard provides enhancements to fixed
wireless operations and enables a cellular-like architecture. Specifically, IEEE 802.16e-2005 provides
mobility support for SSs and implements enhanced signaling techniques that enable new service offerings
such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), presence, and multimedia broadcast. These enhancements to
the previous standard’s QoS make it resilient against communications latency and jitter. 10 Additionally,
IEEE 802.16e-2005 limits the frequency range to 6 GHz or below for mobile operations. IEEE 802.16e-
2005 also introduces new security measures; these are described in detail in Section 3.

Providing support in IEEE 802.16e-2005 for mobile devices necessitated a significant departure from the
process IEEE 802.16-2004 BSs use to manage SSs. IEEE 802.16e-2005 introduces dynamic roaming and
other new methods to manage the communication handoffs between SSs and BSs, i.e., switching an SS
transmission from one BS coverage area into a new BS coverage area as the mobile SS moves. The
communications architecture is also modified to facilitate better power management and efficient modes
of operation to address the power constraints of MSs.

In May 2009, IEEE consolidated 802.16-2004, 802.16e-2005, 802.16f-2005, and 802.16g-2007 into the
latest IEEE 802.16-2009 standard. IEEE 802.16-2009 technically made the consolidated standards and
amendments obsolete; however, as of this writing, many production WiMAX networks are still based on
IEEE 802.16-2004 or IEEE 802.16e-2005. In June 2009, IEEE released the IEEE 802.16j-2009
amendment specifying multi-hop relay. This amendment provides a more developed and thorough

Generally, standards bodies provide a framework for product development but cannot ensure vendor
interoperability. Product certifications serve to encourage market adoption of standards-based technology
and to validate vendor operability claims. A major effort of the WiMAX Forum is designing and
promoting the certification of products based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. The WiMAX Forum operates
the WiMAX Forum Certification Program using accredited testing laboratories and designated
certification bodies to ensure WiMAX products are compatible, interoperable, and conform to industry
standards to ensure the interoperability of different vendor products. This results in greater competition in
the marketplace, greater flexibility in deployment, larger target markets, and lower production costs. 13
The WiMAX Forum warns that “vendors claiming their equipment is ‘WiMAX-like’, ‘WiMAX-
compliant’, and etcetera are not WiMAX Forum Certified, which means that their equipment may not be
interoperable with other vendors’ equipment.” 14




11
       The lack of a robust mesh networking security and communications architecture in IEEE 802.16-2004 resulted in low

3.      WiMAX Security Features

This section discusses the security mechanisms included in IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-2005, IEEE
802.16-2009, and IEEE 802.16j-2009 15 ; it illustrates their functions and provides a foundation for the
security recommendations in Section 4. The IEEE 802.16 standards specify two basic security services:
authentication and confidentiality. Authentication involves the process of verifying the identity claimed
by a WiMAX device. Confidentiality is limited to protecting the contents of WiMAX data messages so
that only authorized devices can view them. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 share the same
authentication and confidentiality mechanisms; they both support user authentication and device
authentication.

The IEEE 802.16 standards do not address other security services such as availability and confidentiality
protection for wireless management messages 16 ; if such services are required, they must be provided
through additional means. Also, while IEEE 802.16 security protects communications over the WMAN
link between an SS/MS and a BS, it does not protect communications on the wired operator network
behind the BS. End-to-end (i.e., device-to-device) security is not possible without applying additional
security controls not specified by the IEEE standards.

WiMAX systems provide secure communications by performing three steps: authentication, key
establishment, and data encryption. Figure 3-1 is a high-level overview of the security framework. The
authentication procedure provides common keying material for the SS/MS and the BS and facilitates the
secure exchange of data encryption keys that ensure the confidentiality of WiMAX data communications.
The remainder of this section explains the basics of the WiMAX security framework, authentication, key
establishment, and data encryption 17 .




15
     IEEE 802.16j-2009 contains all of the security capabilities of IEEE 802.16-2009, and also includes security features for
     multi-hop relay networking. All discussions of IEEE 802.16-2009 security in this publication are also applicable to IEEE
     802.16j-2009.
16
     Management messages are typically not encrypted in wireless communications because adding encryption could negatively
     affect network operations. A common example of a management message is a ranging request used to determine network
     delay at initial network entry and periodically during operations. Because this message is time sensitive, encrypting it would
     diminish network availability.
17
     In Figure 3-1, “Data Encryption” represents not only data encryption, but also control message authentication, integrity, and
     replay protection.

3.1      Security Associations

A security association (SA) is a shared set of security parameters that a BS and its SS/MS use to facilitate
secure communications. Similar in concept to Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), 18 an SA defines the
security parameters of a connection, i.e., encryption keys and algorithms. SAs fall into one of three
categories: authorization, data (for unicast 19 services), and group (for multicast 20 services). A distinct SA
is established for each service offered by the BS. For example, a unicast service would have a unique data
encryption SA, whereas a multicast service would have a unique group SA.

Authorization SAs facilitate authentication and key establishment to configure data and group SAs.
Authorization SAs contain the following attributes:

 X.509 certificates. X.509 digital certificates allow WiMAX communication components to validate
  one another. The manufacturer’s certificate is used for informational purposes, and the BS and SS/MS
  certificates contain the respective devices’ public keys. The certificates are signed by the device
  manufacturer or a third-party certification authority.
 Authorization key (AK). AKs are exchanged between the BS and SS/MS to authenticate one another
  prior to the traffic encryption key (TEK) exchange. The authorization SA includes an identifier and a
  key lifetime value for each AK.

18
      IPsec is a network layer security protocol that provides authentication and encryption over untrusted networks.
19
      Unicast traffic is a single data transmission sent to a single recipient over the same network.
20
      Multicast traffic is a single data transmission sent to multiple recipients over the same network.


                                                                3-2
                                                                     GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



 Key encryption key (KEK). Derived from the AK, the KEK is used to encrypt TEKs during the
  TEK exchange, as discussed in Section 3.3.
 Message authentication keys. Derived from the AK, the message authentication keys validate the
  authenticity of key distribution messages during key establishment. These keys are also used to sign
  management messages to validate message authenticity.
 Authorized data SA list. Provided to the SS/MS by the BS, the authorized data SA list indicates
  which data encryption SAs the SS/MS is authorized to access.
Data SAs establish the parameters used to protect unicast data messages between BSs and SSs/MSs. Data
SAs cannot be applied to management messages, which are never encrypted. A data SA contains the
following security attributes:

 SA identifier (SAID). This unique 16-bit value identifies the SA to distinguish it from other SAs.
 Encryption cipher to be employed. The connection will use this encryption cipher definition to
  provide wireless link confidentiality.
 Traffic encryption key (TEK). TEKs are randomly generated by the BS and are used to encrypt
  WiMAX data messages. Two TEKs are issued to prevent communications disruption during TEK
  rekeying; the first TEK is used for active communications, while the second TEK remains dormant. 21
 Data encryption SA type indicator. This indicator identifies the type of data SA. There are three
  types:

      –    Primary SA. This SA is established as a unique connection for each SS/MS upon initialization
           with the BS. There is only one primary SA per SS/MS.

      –    Static SA. This SA secures the data messages and is generated for each service defined by the BS.

      –    Dynamic SA. This SA is created and eliminated in response to the initiation and termination of
           specific service flows.
Group SAs contain the keying material used to secure multicast traffic. Group SAs are inherently less
secure than data SAs because identical keying material is shared among all members of a BS’s group.
Group SAs contains the following attributes:

 Group traffic encryption key (GTEK). This key is randomly generated by the BS and used to
  encrypt multicast traffic between a BS and SSs/MSs.
 Group key encryption key (GKEK). This key is also randomly generated by the BS and used to
  encrypt the GTEK sent in multicast messages between a BS and SSs/MSs.
3.2       Authentication and Authorization

Networking technologies traditionally refer to authorization as the process that determines the level of
access a node receives after the subject is identified and authenticated. The IEEE 802.16 standard
generally refers to authorization as the process of authenticating WiMAX nodes and granting them access
to the network. This slight distinction made by IEEE 802.16 is that authorization processes implicitly
include authentication. The Privacy Key Management (PKM) protocol is the set of rules responsible for
21
      Per the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard, “Each TEK becomes active halfway through the lifetime of its predecessor and expires
      halfway through the lifetime of its successor” [IEE04]. This cyclical process ensures that keying material is continually
      refreshed.


                                                              3-3
                                                          GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



authentication and authorization to facilitate secure key distribution in WiMAX. PKM uses authorization
SAs to authenticate system entities so that data and group encryption SAs can be established. PKM’s
authentication enforcement function provides the SS/MS and BS with identical AKs; each AK is then
used to derive the message authentication keys and KEKs that facilitate the secure exchange of the TEKs.
IEEE 802.16-2004 derives the AK using PKM version 1 (PKMv1), whereas IEEE 802.16e-2005 and
IEEE 802.16-2009 derive the AK using PKMv2. This section reviews the procedures used in both
PKMv1 and PKMv2.

3.2.1       IEEE 802.16-2004 Authentication and Authorization

In PKMv1 [IEE04], the BS authenticates the identity of the SS, providing one-way authentication. Figure
3-2 illustrates the challenge-response verification scheme used in PKMv1-based authentication. The
authorization process is initiated when the SS sends an authorization information message to the BS. This
message contains the X.509 certificate of the SS manufacturer and is used by the BS for informational
purposes. Immediately following the authorization information message, the SS sends an authorization
request to the BS, which contains the following information:

 The SS’s unique X.509 certificate, which includes its RSA public key
 A description of the SS’s supported cryptographic algorithms
 The primary SAID
Next, the BS validates the SS’s X.509 certificate, communicates the supported cryptographic algorithms
and protocols, and activates an AK for the SS. Then the BS sends the SS an authorization reply message
containing the following information:

 The activated AK, encrypted with the SS’s public key
 The AK sequence number used to differentiate between successive generations of AKs
 The AK lifetime
 A list of SAIDs that the SS is authorized to access and their associated properties
The AK is periodically reauthorized based on its lifetime. The reauthorization process is identical to the
initial authorization process with the exception that the authorization information message is not re-sent.
Reauthorization does not cause a service interruption because two AKs with overlapping lifetimes are
supported simultaneously.

3.2.2         IEEE 802.16-2009 and WiMAX Forum Network Architecture Release 1.5

IEEE 802.16-2009 includes security features of the 802.16e-2005 amendment, which was adopted after
the publication of 802.16-2004. The WiMAX Forum Network Architecture Release 1.5 further extends
the security framework. In particular, the Base Specification delineates the required Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods that a certified device must support, and describes the use of
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Services (RADIUS) (and its Diameter successor) for authentication,
authorization, and accounting (AAA). The addition of EAP and RADIUS/Diameter support enables
WiMAX networks to be tailored to a wide range of robust enterprise security architectures, and also
makes the design and implementation of WiMAX networks more complex than had been the case with
IEEE 802.16-2004.

The WiMAX Forum Network Architecture Release 1.5 states requirements for device and user
authentication. For mutual device authentication based on X.509 certificates, an SS/MS must support
EAP-transport layer security (EAP-TLS). For user authentication, the SS/MS must support either EAP-
authentication and key agreement (EAP-AKA) or EAP-tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS), preferably both.
EAP-AKA is an authentication method used in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
and CDMA2000 networks. It is based on symmetric key encryption that typically runs in a subscriber
identity module (SIM) or similar smart card. 22 EAP-TTLS authenticates the network to the user with an
X.509 certificate and authenticates the user to the network with another “tunneled” EAP method. The

22
     EAP-AKA is described in RFC 4187, which can be found at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4187.


                                                             3-5

WiMAX Forum Network Architecture Release 1.5 requires that EAP-TTLS support Microsoft Challenge-
handshake authentication protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2) at a minimum. Vendors may implement other
EAP methods at their discretion to support specialized authentication requirements. Organizations should
strongly consider WiMAX solutions capable of supporting EAP methods for mutual authentication as
recommended in NIST SP 800-120, Recommendation for EAP Methods Used in Wireless Network Access
Authentication.

IEEE 802.16-2009 also specifies a Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) authentication protocol for mutual
device authentication that uses X.509 certificates that contain the device’s media access control (MAC)
address. According to the standard, devices that use this protocol must either have factory-installed
public/private key pairs or provide an internal algorithm to generate the pair automatically. The method
has no known security vulnerabilities. However, it is not included in the WiMAX Forum Network
Architecture Release 1.5 and, consequently, WiMAX certified products do not necessarily have an RSA
Authentication feature. Additionally, IEEE 802.16-2009 RSA Authentication should not be confused
with EAP methods that also use X.509 certificates and employ RSA algorithms.

Figure 3-3 depicts the EAP authentication procedure. The first EAP exchange results in the production of
a 512-bit master session key (MSK) that is disclosed to the AAA server, the operator network, and the
SS/MS. The BS and SS/MS truncate the MSK to 320 bits – 160 bits for the pairwise master key (PMK)
and 160 bits to create another EAP Integrity Key (EIK) to protect an optional EAP user authentication
procedure. The PMK, the SS/MS MAC address, and the BS identifier are then used to derive the AK.

3.3     Encryption Key Establishment

Once authentication is complete, the BS and SS/MS share an activated AK. PKM then uses the 160-bit
AK to derive the 128-bit KEK and the 160-bit message authentication keys, which are used to facilitate a
secure exchange of TEKs. 23 The secure TEK exchange uses a three-way handshake between the BS and
the SS/MS, as illustrated in Figure 3-4. 24




                                         Figure 3-4. TEK Three-Way Handshake

The first step in this procedure is the TEK-Challenge sent from the BS to the SS/MS. The TEK-Challenge
is sent during initial network entry or during reauthorization. The TEK-Challenge includes the following
attributes:

23
      In some cases, the message authentication keys can be derived from the EIK during the EAP exchange.
24
      The depiction of the handshake in Figure 3-6 illustrates a general framework for TEK exchange defined in PKM. TEK
      exchanges will vary slightly depending on which encryption algorithm is being used.


                                                             3-7

 BS random number. This number is attached to the TEK-Challenge to prevent replay attacks 25 by
  validating message freshness.
 Message authentication code. This validates data authenticity of the key distribution messages sent
  from the BS to the SS/MS.
 AK sequence number and AK identifier (AKID). These attributes identify which AK is used for
  the TEK exchange.
Upon receipt of the TEK-Challenge, the SS/MS validates the authenticity of the TEK-Challenge using the
message authentication keys. After the TEK-Challenge has been validated, the SS/MS then sends the
TEK-Request to the BS, which contains the following attributes:

 BS and SS/MS random numbers. In addition to sending back the BS random number from the
  TEK-Challenge, the SS/MS attaches its own random value.
 Message authentication code. These validate data authenticity of the key distribution messages sent
  from the SS/MS to the BS.
 AK sequence number and AKID. These identify which AK is used for the TEK exchange.
 Security capabilities parameters. These describe the security capabilities of the SS/MS, including
  supported cryptographic suites. During initial network entry, the TEK-Request will also include a
  request for SA descriptors to identify the primary, static, and dynamic SAs that the SS/MS is
  authorized to access.
Upon receipt of the TEK-Request, the BS verifies that the BS random number matches the number sent in
the TEK-Challenge and validates the message authentication keys. The BS next confirms that the AKID
refers to an available AK and that the security capabilities parameters provided by the SS/MS are
supported. Once the TEK-Request is validated, the BS will generate two TEKs, along with the GKEK and
the GTEK. The BS then sends the TEK-Response to the SS/MS, which contains the following attributes:

 BS and SS/MS random number. The BS attaches the BS random number generated in the TEK-
  Challenge and the SS/MS random number generated in the TEK-Request.
 Message authentication code. These validate data authenticity for the key distribution messages sent
  from the BS to the SS/MS.
 AK sequence number and AKID. These attributes identify which AK is used for the TEK
  exchange.
 List of authorized SAIDs. This is the list of primary, static, and dynamic SAs that the SS/MS is
  authorized to access.
 TEKs, GKEK, and GTEK. Using the KEK derived from the AK, the BS encrypts the two TEKs, the
  GKEK, and the GTEK. These keys include all of the required keying material needed to facilitate
  secure communications.
Upon receipt of the TEK-Response, the SS/MS will ensure the BS random number matches the value
given in the TEK-Challenge and that the SS/MS random number matches the value delivered in the TEK-

25
     Replay attacks involve capturing legitimate traffic and then replaying it at a later time for malicious purposes. A standard
     replay attack involves replaying authentication credentials to gain unauthorized system access. Mechanisms for protecting
     against replay attacks typically involve inserting data that unpredictably varies over time, thereby ensuring that messages
     captured at a given point in time will not be useful sometime thereafter.


                                                               3-8
                                                                   GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



Request. The SS/MS will then validate the message authentication keys. Once validation is complete, the
SS/MS will install the appropriate TEKs, GTEK, and GKEK, and secure communications can begin.

In the case of an MS performing a handover to a new BS, the TEK-Response message also includes TEK,
GTEK, and GKEK parameters of the previously serving BS to reduce latency associated with renewing
SAs.

3.4     Data Confidentiality

The completion of the TEK exchange provides the SS/MS and BS with the TEKs required to encrypt
WiMAX data communications. The type of encryption employed by the TEK varies by IEEE 802.16
standard.

IEEE 802.16-2004 only supports one encryption algorithm, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in cipher
block chaining (CBC) mode (DES-CBC). During the TEK three-way handshake, the BS sends the SS an
SA-specific initialization vector (IV) as part of the TEK-Response. The DES-CBC algorithm uses this
SA-specific IV in conjunction with the TEK to encrypt data traffic. DES-CBC has significant weaknesses
and should not be used to provide confidentiality for communications. 26

IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 support DES-CBC and three AES 27 modes of operation for
data encryption: CBC, counter (CTR), and CTR with CBC message authentication code (CCM). Any of
the three specified AES modes is acceptable for protecting data message confidentiality. 28 CTR mode is
considered stronger than CBC because CTR mode is less complex to implement, offers encryption block
preprocessing, and can process data in parallel. CCM mode enhances CTR by adding the capability to
verify the authenticity of encrypted messages. CCM is considered the most secure of the cryptographic
suites defined in IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 because it adds a per packet randomization
integrity check that prevents replay attacks. 29 Because of this, whenever feasible the CCM mode should
be used instead of CTR or CBC.

CCM was specifically designed to have the following characteristics [Fra07]:

 A single cryptographic key for confidentiality and integrity to minimize complexity and maximize
  performance (minimize key scheduling time)
 Integrity protection of the packet header and packet payload, in addition to providing confidentiality
  of the payload
 Computation of some cryptographic parameters prior to the receipt of packets to enable fast
  comparisons when they arrive, which reduces latency
 Small footprint (hardware or software implementation size) to minimize costs
 Small security-related packet overhead (e.g., minimal data expansion due to cryptographic padding
  and integrity field)



26
      Additionally, DES-CBC is not approved for Federal agency use in protecting the confidentiality of communications.
27
      AES is defined by FIPS PUB 197 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf).
28
      NIST SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation, recommends the use of five confidentiality
      modes of operation for symmetric key block cipher algorithms. The modes may be used in conjunction with any symmetric
      key block cipher algorithm that is approved by a FIPS. The five modes—the Electronic Codebook (ECB), CBC, Cipher
      Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and CTR modes—can provide data confidentiality.
29
      CCM is defined by RFC 3610, Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3610.txt.

Additional information on data encryption, particularly Federal agency-specific requirements, is presented
in Section 4.3.3.

3.5   IEEE 802.16j-2009 Multi-Hop Relay Security Architecture

The confidentiality and authentication security mechanisms used in IEEE 802.16j-2009 are identical to
those in IEEE 802.16-2009. An additional security mechanism is required to operate a WiMAX network
in a multi-hop relay—the establishment of a Security Zone (SZ). An SZ is the set of trusted relationships
between a BS (acting as the master relay), RSs, and SSs/MSs. RSs and SSs/MSs become members of a
BS’s SZ by authenticating using PKMv2. Upon authenticating, the BS delivers SZ key material used to
provide integrity protection to management messages in the SZ.

Multi-hop relay can operate in two security control architectures, centralized and distributed. In a
centralized security architecture, RSs forward data and management messages destined for the next hop in
the network without performing any decryption or authentication of management messages. Thus, every
SA is established between each node and the BS with RSs strictly relaying traffic.

The IEEE 802.16j-2009 distributed security architecture provides greater scalability because network
nodes are only required to establish SAs to adjacent nodes. For example, imagine an SS/MS that requires
two RS hops to communicate back to the master relay BS. To create a secure route in a distributed
architecture, the initial RS hop, referred to as the access RS, establishes an SA to the master relay BS.
Then, the access RS relays authentication messages on behalf of the master relay BS to the next hop or
subordinate RS. Upon establishing the MSK between the BS and the subordinate RS, the BS will forward
the relevant AK to the first hop access RS. This allows the access RS to derive all of the necessary keys to
establish a separate SA with the subordinate RS. The subordinate RS then establishes a separate SA with
the destination SS/MS by employing the same method it used to establish the SA with the access RS. The
culmination of these distributed SAs can be seen in Figure 3-5. There is now a secure tunnel between the
BS and destination SS/MS while simultaneously load-balancing encryption processing away from the
master BS. The logical security risk associated with a distributed model that shares keying information
across multiple nodes is negligible because all SAs are established using PKMv2.

4.      Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Countermeasures for WiMAX Systems

This section describes vulnerabilities in the IEEE 802.16 specifications, threats to WiMAX systems, and
countermeasures to mitigate those threats. WiMAX systems are susceptible to WiMAX-specific threats as
well as threats common to all wireless technologies. Organizations should mitigate threats and
vulnerabilities for WiMAX systems by implementing a combination of management, operational, and
technical countermeasures. 30

4.1     Vulnerabilities

This section discusses vulnerabilities specific to IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-2005, and IEEE
802.16-2009. (All discussion related to IEEE 802.16-2009 also applies to IEEE 802.16j-2009.) IEEE
802.16-2004 has more innate vulnerabilities than IEEE 802.16e-2005 or IEEE 802.16-2009. The security
mechanisms available in IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 address some, but not all, of IEEE
802.16-2004’s shortcomings. The following discusses several major vulnerabilities:

 Lack of BS to SS/MS authentication. PKMv1 defines authentication of SSs by BSs but provides no
  means to authenticate BSs by SSs/MSs. Lack of mutual authentication may allow a rogue BS to
  impersonate a legitimate BS, thereby rendering the SS/MS unable to verify the authenticity of
  protocol messages received from the BS. A successful attack would enable a rogue BS operator to
  take complete control of all traffic to and from the SS/MS, including capture of authentication
  credentials. Such an attack would also enable the rogue BS to impersonate name servers, allowing it
  to redirect user requests to computers with malware without easy detection. This vulnerability is
  mitigated in IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 by the use of mutual authentication.
 Weak encryption algorithms. For encrypting communications, IEEE 802.16-2004 only supports the
  use of DES-CBC, which has well-documented weaknesses and is no longer approved for Federal
  agency use in protecting communications. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 support DES-
  CBC, but they also support multiple modes of AES that are approved for Federal government use.
 Interjection of reused TEKs. IEEE 802.16-2004 TEKs employ a 2-bit encryption sequence
  identifier to determine which TEK is actively used to secure communications. A 2-bit identifier
  permits only four possible identifier values, rendering the system vulnerable to replay attacks. The
  interjection of reused TEKs may lead to the disclosure of data and the TEK to unauthorized parties
  [Joh04]. This concern is resolved in IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 with the introduction
  of AES-CCM, which provides per packet randomization by adding a unique packet number to each
  data packet to protect the integrity of data and portions of the packet header.
 Unencrypted management messages. Management messages are not encrypted and are susceptible
  to eavesdropping attacks. Encryption is not applied to these messages to increase the efficiency of
  network operations. IEEE 802.16-2004 does not provide any data authenticity protection for
  management messages. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 provide integrity protection for
  certain unicast management messages by appending a unique digest to protect against malicious
  replay or modification attacks. This digest is not added to IEEE 802.16 multicast and initial network
  entry management messages. As with all wireless systems, digest integrity protection cannot be
  applied to management messages sent to multiple recipients (i.e., multicast transmissions), and initial
  network entry management messages cannot leverage integrity protection because nodes must first be
  authenticated to create the unique digest. In a man-in-the-middle attack (see Section 4.2), an

30
      These controls are typically documented in a System Security Plan. For more information, see NIST SP 800-18 Revision 1,
      Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-18-
      Rev1/sp800-18-Rev1-final.pdf).


                                                             4-1
                                                                     GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



      adversary may manipulate management messages to disrupt network communications, by denial of
      service (DoS) attacks aimed at the WiMAX system, at specific network nodes, or both. IEEE
      802.16m supports full encryption and authentication for management messages, but it has not been
      integrated into many vendor solutions as of the writing of this publication because IEEE 802.16m was
      recently released.
 Use of electromagnetic spectrum as a communications medium. Using RF to communicate
  inherently enables execution of a DoS attack by introducing a powerful RF source intended to
  overwhelm system radio spectrum. This vulnerability is associated with all wireless technologies. The
  only defenses are either to locate and remove the source of RF interference or to move to another
  channel. Such actions can be challenging because of the large coverage areas of WMANs and the
  scarcity of alternative frequencies to support communications. It is recommended that organizations
  plan for out-of-band communications in the event of a DoS attack.
4.2     Threats

WiMAX network threats focus on compromising the radio links between WiMAX nodes. LOS WiMAX
systems pose a greater challenge to attack compared with NLOS systems because an adversary would
have to physically locate equipment between the transmitting nodes to compromise the confidentiality or
integrity of the wireless link. NLOS systems provide wireless coverage over large geographic regions,
which expands the potential staging areas for both clients and adversaries. The following threats affect all
WiMAX systems:

 RF jamming. All wireless technologies are susceptible to RF jamming attacks. The threat arises from
  an adversary introducing a powerful RF signal to overwhelm the spectrum being used by the system,
  thus denying service to all wireless nodes within range of the interference. RF jamming is classified
  as a DoS attack. The risk associated with this threat is identical for IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-
  2005, and IEEE 802.16-2009 WiMAX systems.
 Scrambling. Scrambling attacks, which are the precise injections of RF interference during the
  transmission of specific management messages, affect all wireless systems. These attacks prevent
  proper network ranging and bandwidth allocations with the intent to degrade overall system
  performance [Nas08]. Scrambling attacks are more difficult to identify than jamming attacks because
  they are engaged for short time periods and are not a constant source of interference. The risk
  associated with this threat is identical for IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-2005, and IEEE 802.16-
  2009.
 Subtle management message manipulation. Exploitation of unauthenticated management messages
  can result in subtle DoS, replay, or misappropriation 31 attacks that are difficult to detect. These
  attacks spoof management messages to make them appear as though they come from a legitimate BS
  or SS/MS, allowing them to deny service to various nodes in the WiMAX system. A water torture
  attack is an example of a subtle DoS in which an adversary drains a client node’s battery by sending a
  constant series of management messages to the SS/MS [Joh04]. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE
  802.16-2009 provide integrity protection for certain unicast management messages following initial
  network registration with an appended integrity protection digest. All other IEEE 802.16e-2005 and
  IEEE 802.16-2009 management messages, and all IEEE 802.16-2004 management messages, are
  susceptible to attacks involving manipulation.
 Man-in-the-middle. Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when an adversary deceives an SS/MS to
  appear as a legitimate BS while simultaneously deceiving a BS to appear as a legitimate SS/MS. This

31
      Misappropriation occurs when an attacker steals or makes unauthorized use of a service.


                                                               4-2
                                                          GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



      may allow an adversary to act as a pass-through for all SS/MS communications and to inject
      malicious traffic into the communications stream. An adversary can perform a man-in-the-middle
      attack by exploiting unprotected management messages during the initial network entry process. This
      is because the management messages that negotiate an SS’s/MS’s security capabilities are not
      protected. If an adversary is able to impersonate a legitimate party to both the SS/MS and BS, an
      adversary could send malicious management messages and negotiate weaker security protection
      between the SS/MS and BS [Han06]. This weaker security protection may allow an adversary to
      eavesdrop and corrupt data communications. Mandating the use of AES-CCM in IEEE 802.16e-2005
      and IEEE 802.16-2009 helps mitigate this attack because it appends a unique value to each data
      packet, which, in turn, prevents the man-in-the-middle traffic relays between BS and SS/MS. IEEE
      802.16-2004 does not offer adequate protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
 Eavesdropping. Eavesdropping occurs when an adversary uses a WiMAX traffic analyzer within the
  range of a BS or SS/MS. The large operating range of WiMAX networks helps to shield
  eavesdroppers from detection; eavesdropping mitigation relies heavily on technical controls that
  protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The adversary may monitor management
  message traffic to identify encryption ciphers, determine the footprint of the network, or conduct
  traffic analysis regarding specific WiMAX nodes. Data messages collected during eavesdropping can
  also be used to decipher DES-CBC encryption; however, AES provides robust data message
  confidentiality that cannot be circumvented through eavesdropping. The risk associated with
  eavesdropping management messages is identical for IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-2005, and
  IEEE 802.16-2009. The risk associated with eavesdropping data messages is significant for IEEE
  802.16-2004 systems due to weak encryption. IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 systems
  offer the stronger AES cipher to protect data messages from eavesdropping.
4.3     Countermeasures

This section presents countermeasures that may be used to reduce or mitigate the risks inherent to
WiMAX systems. These countermeasures do not guarantee security and cannot prevent all possible
attacks. The optimum security design is a dynamic intersection of threat risk and the cost of
countermeasures that will change in response to technology. Organizations should implement
countermeasures commensurate with their acceptable level of risk.

The WiMAX management, operational, and technical countermeasures described in the following
sections take an approach similar to that of NIST SP 800-48 Revision 1, Guide to Securing Legacy IEEE
802.11 Wireless Networks [Sca08]. IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 share many management and
operational controls but strongly differ in their technical controls. WiMAX systems should leverage the
countermeasures found in this Special Publication, in FIPS PUB 199, and in NIST SP 800-53. FIPS PUB
199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems establishes
three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a security breach
involving a particular system [NIS04]. NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems and Organizations, provides recommendations for minimum management,
operational, and technical security controls for information systems based on the FIPS PUB 199 impact
categories [NIS09]. Regardless of a system’s sensitivity classification, WiMAX security should be
incorporated throughout the entire lifecycle of WiMAX solutions [Kis08].

4.3.1    Management Countermeasures

Management countermeasures generally address any problem related to risk, system planning, or security
assessment by an organization’s management. Organizations should develop a wireless security policy
that addresses WiMAX technology. A security policy is an organization’s foundation for designing,

4.3.2    Operational Countermeasures

Operational countermeasures include controls that are executed by people, e.g., personnel security,
physical environment protection, configuration management, security awareness and training, and
incident response. These controls are documented in a system security plan (SSP) which should be
maintained by all parties involved with WiMAX system operations. SSPs are living documents that
provide an overview of the security requirements of a system and describe the controls in place to meet
those requirements; this includes all system hardware and software, policies, roles and responsibilities,
and other documentation materials. Documentation itself is a security control, as it formalizes security
and operational procedures to a given system. 34

Physical security is fundamental to ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to WiMAX
equipment. Physical security includes measures such as physical access control systems, personnel
security and identification, and external boundary protection. For example, integrating Federal personal
identity verification (PIV) 35 into physical access controls can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
WiMAX systems. 36 WiMAX system administrators and users should receive training to address the
specific challenges and threats to wireless technologies. While it is difficult to prevent unauthorized users
from attempting to access a WiMAX system because of its expansive coverage area, the use of additional
security mechanisms may help prevent the theft, alteration, or misuse of WiMAX infrastructure
components.

WiMAX operates on licensed or unlicensed RF spectrum. The most prevalent spectrum used to
accommodate WiMAX is the 2.5 GHz licensed range, but WiMAX solutions are also viable across
several unlicensed spectrum ranges. Organizations should understand the implications of spectrum
allocation as it impacts system availability. Due to the proliferation of unlicensed wireless technologies,
interference may become an implementation obstacle when operating in unlicensed spectrum. Regardless
of which spectrum frequency is used, organizations should use counter-interference technologies 37 in
addition to site surveys to ensure system availability.

Prior to deployment, site surveys construct the foundation for a WiMAX system’s design to ensure
system availability. Long distance radio transmissions should be tailored and optimized for RF obstacles
and interference sources. Site surveys help limit range to provide an organization operational awareness
of a system’s coverage area. Site survey tools include terrain maps, global positioning systems, RF
propagation models, spectrum analyzers, packet analyzers, and additional tools which provide a more
thorough understanding of the environment’s RF landscape. Conducting a WMAN site survey requires
specialized skills, and it is typically provided as part of the overall vendor solution. Organizations should,
at a minimum, involve themselves in the site survey process and document its findings in the system
security plan.

As with all wireless technologies, operational countermeasures may not provide protection against
general wireless threats such as DoS, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and message replay. Operational
controls often require highly specialized expertise and rely upon both management and technical controls.

4.3.3     Technical Countermeasures

Technical countermeasures are system safeguards implemented by computer systems, such as,
authentication, access control, auditing, and communication protection. Technical countermeasures are
typically designed into WiMAX systems before implementation and vary widely between vendors.
Before implementing a WiMAX system, an organization should consult WiMAX vendors to gain a better
understanding of potential system reconfiguration constraints and the need for compensating controls to
address technical security needs that the WiMAX product may not address.

Confidentiality and Integrity Protection

WiMAX systems broadcast data over a large geographic area that is usually outside the organization’s
physical control. Organizations must rely on data-in-transit encryption to provide confidentiality and
integrity protection for its wireless links. As explained in Section 3.4, each IEEE 802.16 standard
specifies encryption algorithms to provide data protection.

Federal agencies that need to protect the confidentiality of their WiMAX data communications are
required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic modules implemented by encryption algorithms to protect
data communications. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: using WiMAX equipment (BSs,
SSs, and MSs) that is FIPS-validated and operating in FIPS mode, 38 or encrypting the data through a
separate encryption technology, such as a FIPS-validated VPN. Organizations using IEEE 802.16e-2005
or IEEE 802.16-2009 WiMAX technology should implement FIPS-validated AES encryption to protect
OSI Data Link Layer radio data communications. Organizations using WiMAX solutions that do not
support FIPS-validated encryption schemes (e.g., IEEE 802.16-2004 technologies, IEEE 802.16e-2005
and IEEE 802.16-2009 technologies that are not FIPS-validated) should implement FIPS-validated
encryption overlay solutions to protect OSI Data Link or Network Layer data communications. 39 Data
Link encryption overlay solutions provide encryption for all data traffic taking place at the OSI Network
Layer and above, including packet headers and trailers. Network Layer encryption solutions provide
encryption for the data portion of the Network Layer, including all upper-layer data.

Encryption overlay solutions require an encryption appliance behind the BS and a corresponding
supplicant or termination point on the end user device. A supplicant is a software program on a client
device that coordinates authentication with the encryption overlay appliance. The encryption appliance
and supplicant work in tandem to encrypt data before it reaches the WiMAX system. Thus, the WiMAX
system serves as the transmission medium between the supplicant and the appliance. Figure 4-1 illustrates
this communications path over the WiMAX network.




                                          Figure 4-1. Encryption Overlay Solution

38
     FIPS 140-2 is the current Federal standard that specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic
     module. A new version, FIPS 140-3, is in development. Both are at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
39
     The use of encryption overlay solutions may limit mobile operations because of a lack of handover and QoS support.


                                                                4-6
                                                                  GUIDE TO SECURING WIMAX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS



Data Link Layer encryption solutions are not guaranteed to work with all WiMAX solutions because of
the way IEEE 802.16 solutions treat the OSI Data Link packet convergence sub-layer that is responsible
for transferring data between the OSI Data Link and Network layers. IEEE 802.16-2004, IEEE 802.16e-
2005, and IEEE 802.16-2009 allow for two traffic types, Ethernet header and IP. Solutions that use IP
type may not work with solutions that completely encrypt the OSI Network Layer because the layered
encryption will hide information required to pass packets through the WiMAX system. Typically, IP
classification is used in mobile operations while Ethernet header classification is used in P2P and PMP
operations. Prior to procuring an OSI Data Link Layer encryption solution, organizations should first
inquire which traffic classification a vendor’s WiMAX implementation supports.

Another method of providing confidentiality and integrity protection is by using a VPN. A VPN is a
virtual network that creates a secure tunnel between devices to provide a secure communications channel
for data and IP information. VPNs are often used to facilitate the secure transfer of sensitive data across
shared and untrusted networks. VPNs can be established within a WMAN to create a private network and
protect sensitive communications from other parties sharing network resources. VPNs are a mature
technology, and a variety of VPN technologies exist, such as IPsec and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
VPNs. 40

Organizations using VPNs to protect the confidentiality of WMAN communications should configure the
VPNs to use FIPS-validated encryption algorithms employing FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. 41
One method is to use VPNs to protect WMAN communications by establishing a VPN tunnel between
the WMAN client device (i.e., the SS/MS) and a VPN concentrator behind the BS. With an IPsec VPN,
security services are provided at the OSI Network Layer of the protocol stack, which will secure all
applications and protocols operating at the OSI Network Layer and above. VPN security services are
independent of OSI Data Link Layer protocols, and they are recommended for use if the underlying
wireless security mechanisms are vulnerable or lack FIPS validation. VPNs do not eliminate all risk from
wireless networking. If further assurance is required, OSI Data Link wireless security controls can be
used to provide an additional layer of security.

When determining how confidentiality and integrity should be protected, organizations should examine
their WiMAX client devices to determine which types of cryptographic algorithms are supported and their
key length limitations and re-keying period. Organizations should verify that these client cryptographic
capabilities meet the minimum confidentiality protection requirements. Secret keys should be periodically
replaced in accordance with an organization’s IT security policy to reduce the potential effect of a key
compromise. 42

Authentication and Authorization

IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 support an array of authentication solutions to provide both
device and user authentication between a BS and MS/SSs. These authentication solutions can support the
use of usernames and passwords, smart cards, subscriber identity module cards, biometrics, public key
infrastructure (PKI), or a combination of these solutions (e.g., smart cards with PKI). 43 Organizations
should strongly consider WiMAX solutions capable of supporting Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP) methods for mutual authentication as discussed in NIST SP 800-120, Recommendation for EAP

40

     SSL VPNs (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).
41
     Use of such modules and algorithms is mandatory for Federal agencies in this situation.

Methods Used in Wireless Network Access Authentication. 44 WiMAX solutions that cannot meet these
criteria should employ a different means of authentication at a higher layer (e.g., encryption overlay or
VPN).

Client Device Security

Devices that have been granted access to a WiMAX system should be properly secured to enhance the
system security posture. Securing the infrastructure without properly securing client devices may
compromise system security. Organizations should implement the client security controls appropriate for
the type of device, the device’s operating system and applications, the sensitivity of the data that the
device holds and accesses, and the threats that it faces. Possible client device security considerations
include the following:

 Personal firewalls. Resources on WMANs have a higher risk of attack than those on wired networks,
  because they generally do not have the same degree of protection. Personal firewalls increase device
  security by offering some protection against unwanted network connections initiated by other hosts.
  Personal firewalls are software applications that reside on a client device and are either client
  managed or centrally managed. Centrally managed solutions provide a greater degree of protection
  because IT departments may configure and remotely manage these solutions rather than leaving the
  management to the end user. Centrally managed solutions allow organizations to modify client
  firewalls to protect against known vulnerabilities, react to new threats and vulnerabilities, and
  maintain a consistent security policy for all client users. Personal firewalls may also have built-in
  VPN capabilities that further ease deployment.
 Host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). A host-based IDPS provides
  complementary security services to a personal firewall. Host-based IDPS software monitors and
  analyzes the internal state of a client device. IDPS products review logs to ensure that the system and
  applications are not functioning unexpectedly, such as applications inexplicably accessing or altering
  other portions of the system. Several host-based IDPS software products also monitor inbound and
  outbound network communications and report or possibly block suspicious activity.
 Antimalware software. Antivirus software and other forms of antimalware software can assist in
  preventing the spread of viruses, worms, and other malware between networked devices. Most client
  devices are at risk from malware threats, so such devices should have appropriate antimalware
  software installed and receive automatic updates.
 IEEE 802.16 radio management. Client devices that have no business need for IEEE 802.16 should
  have their wireless radios disabled by default. If IEEE 802.16 use is required, users should disable the
  radio when not in use (if feasible).
 Policy enforcement. Client devices should be configured to comply with implemented WMAN
  policies. Devices should be configured according to policy, such as disabling services or altering
  default configurations. In addition, policy-driven software solutions can be implemented on client
  devices to prevent or allow certain actions when specific parameters exist. Policy-driven software
  helps ensure that client devices and users comply with an organization’s defined policies. For
  example, policy-based software can prevent client devices from having more than one network
  interface enabled at a time.
In addition to these considerations for client device security, organizations should also ensure that
wireless client devices are logically separated from the organization’s wired networks. This is most

commonly implemented by using a filtering device between the WiMAX system and the wired network.
A network appliance can logically segment user populations and govern data communications.

Patches, Upgrades, and Updates

Like other network equipment vendors, IEEE 802.16 vendors typically issue patches, upgrades, or
firmware updates to correct known software and hardware security vulnerabilities. Network
administrators should regularly check with vendors to identify these updates and implement them as
needed, in accordance with the organization’s procedures and policies. 45 In addition, many vendors have
security alert email lists to advise customers of new vulnerabilities and attacks. Administrators can also
check the National Vulnerability Database 46 and Wireless Vulnerability & Exploits database 47 for listings
of publicly known vulnerabilities.

4.4     Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Countermeasures Summary Table

IEEE 802.16e-2005 and IEEE 802.16-2009 include security features that address many of the technical
shortcomings of IEEE 802.16-2004. Organizations with WiMAX implementations pre-dating IEEE
802.16e-2005 should implement a mitigation plan and/or migration plan to outline the procedures or
restrictions for transitioning legacy WiMAX systems to a compliant security architecture.

                                    remains vulnerable to a man-in-the-
                                    middle attack.

Solutions                           vendors had not completed the             VPN that employs a FIPS-validated
                                    FIPS-validation process. This             solution, i.e., FIPS-validated
                                    prevents Federal entities from relying    encryption algorithms and FIPS-

                                    of information. These threats include
                                    eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle,
                                    and DoS attacks.

Appendix A—Glossary

Selected terms used in the guide are defined below.

Authentication: For the purposes of this guide, the process of verifying the identity claimed by a
WiMAX device. User authentication is also an option supported by IEEE 802.16e-2005.

Authorization: The process that takes place after authentication is complete to determine which
resources/services are available to a WiMAX device.

Authorization key (AK): A key exchanged between the base station and subscriber station/mobile
station to authenticate one another prior to the traffic encryption key (TEK) exchange.

Authorized data security association (SA) list: A list that the BS provides to the SS/MS that indicates
which data encryption SAs the SS/MS is authorized to use.

Backhaul: Typically a high capacity line from a remote site or network to a central site or network.

Base station (BS): The node that logically connects fixed and mobile subscriber stations to operator
networks. The BS governs access to the operator networks and maintains communications with client
devices. A BS consists of the infrastructure elements necessary to enable wireless communications, i.e.,
antennas, transceivers, and other electromagnetic wave transmitting equipment. BSs are typically fixed
nodes, but in a tactical environment, they may also be considered mobile.

Confidentiality: For the purposes of this guide, prevention of the disclosure of information by ensuring
that only authorized devices can view the contents of WiMAX communications.

Data encryption security association (SA) type indicator: An indicator defining the type of data
encryption SA (primary, static, or dynamic).

Diameter: A successor AAA protocol to RADIUS that supports enhanced security and communication
methods.

Eavesdropping: Type of attack in which an adversary uses a WiMAX traffic analyzer within the range of
a BS or SS/MS to monitor WiMAX communications.

Group key encryption key (GKEK): A cryptographic key used to encrypt the GTEK sent in multicast
messages between a BS and two or more SSs/MSs.
Group traffic encryption key (GTEK): A cryptographic key used to encrypt multicast traffic between a
BS and two or more SSs/MSs.
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec): An OSI Network layer security protocol that provides authentication
and encryption over IP networks.

Intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS): An appliance or software product that provides
complementary security services to a personal firewall, monitoring and analyzing the internal state of a
client device. IDPS products review logs to ensure that the system and applications are not functioning
unexpectedly, such as applications inexplicably accessing or altering other portions of the system. Several
host-based IDPS software products also monitor inbound and outbound network communications and
report or possibly block suspicious activity.

Jitter: As it relates to queuing, the difference in latency of packets.

Key encryption key (KEK): A key derived from the authorization key that is used to encrypt traffic
encryption keys (TEK) during the TEK exchange.

Last mile broadband access: Communications technology that bridges the transmission distance
between the broadband service provider infrastructure and the customer premises equipment.

Line-of-sight (LOS) signal propagation: Electromagnetic signaling that is highly sensitive to radio
frequency obstacles and therefore requires an unobstructed view between transmitting stations.

Management countermeasure: A countermeasure that addresses any concern related to risk, system
planning, or security assessment by an organization’s management.

Management message: A message used for maintaining communications between an SS/MS and BS,
i.e., establishing communication parameters, exchanging privacy settings, and performing system
registration events (initial network entry, handoffs, etc.). These messages are not encrypted and are
susceptible to eavesdropping attacks.

Man-in-the-middle (MITM): An attack that occurs when an adversary deceives an SS/MS to appear as a
legitimate BS while simultaneously deceiving a BS to appear as a legitimate SS/MS. This may allow an
adversary to act as a pass-through for all communications and to inject malicious traffic into the
communications stream.

Message authentication key: A key that validates the data authenticity of the key distribution messages
sent from the BS to the SS/MS.
Misappropriation: An attack in which the attacker steals or makes unauthorized use of a service.
Mobile subscriber (MS): As defined in IEEE 802.16e-2005, an SS capable of moving at vehicular
speeds and that supports enhanced power management modes of operation. MS devices typically have a
small form factor and are self-powered, e.g., laptops, ultra-mobile portable computers, cellular
telephones, or other portable electronic devices.

Mobile topology: A configuration similar to a cellular network, where multiple BSs collaborate and
provide seamless communications over a distributed network to both SSs and MSs.

Multi-hop relay topology: A configuration that extends a BS’s coverage area by permitting SSs and MSs
to relay traffic by acting as RSs. Data destined to an SS/MS outside of the BS’s range is relayed through
adjacent RSs.

Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) technology: The use of multiple antennas and advanced
signaling techniques to increase wireless network range, resiliency, and speed.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation: Electromagnetic signaling that uses advanced
modulation techniques to compensate for signal obstacles and allows indirect communications between
transmitting stations.

Operational countermeasure: A countermeasure that includes controls that are executed by people, e.g.,
physical environment protection, configuration management, and incident response.

Personal firewall: A software application residing on a client device that increases device security by
offering some protection against unwanted network connections initiated by other hosts. Personal
firewalls may be client managed or centrally managed.

Quality of Service (QoS): A categorization of different types of network traffic to prioritize latency-
sensitive data over non-latency-sensitive data.

Radio frequency (RF) jamming: A threat in which an adversary introduces a powerful RF signal to
overwhelm the spectrum being used by the system, thus denying service to all wireless nodes within
range of the interference. RF jamming is classified as a DoS attack.

Relay station (RS): An SS that is configured to forward traffic to other stations in a multi-hop Security
Zone.

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS): A centralized Authentication, Authorization,
and Accounting (AAA) protocol currently defined in RFC 2865.

Scrambling: The precise injection of RF interference during the transmission of specific management
messages. These attacks prevent proper network ranging and bandwidth allocations with the intent to
degrade overall system performance.

Security association (SA): The logical set of security parameters containing elements required for
authentication, key establishment, and data encryption.

Security association identifier (SAID): A unique 16-bit value that identifies the SA.

Security Zone (SZ): A set of trusted relationships between a BS and a group of RSs.

Standard operating procedure: A set of instructions used to describe a process or procedure that
performs an explicit operation or explicit reaction to a given event.

Subscriber station (SS): A wireless node that typically communicates only with a BS, except when part
of a multi-hop relay configuration.

System security plan (SSP): A system document that provides an overview of the security requirements
of a system and describes the controls in place to meet those requirements.

Technical countermeasures: System safeguards implemented by computer systems, including controls
such as authentication, access control, auditing, and protecting communications.

Unilateral authentication: An IEEE 802.16-2004 vulnerability resulting from PKMv1 providing for
authentication of SSs by BSs but not for authentication of BSs by SSs. Lack of mutual authentication may
allow a rogue BS to impersonate a legitimate BS, thereby rendering the SS unable to verify the
authenticity of protocol messages received from the BS. This may enable a rogue BS operator to degrade
performance or steal valuable information by conducting DoS or man-in-the-middle attacks against client
SSs.

Virtual private network (VPN): A logical network that is established at the network layer of the OSI
model. The logical network typically provides authentication and data confidentiality services for some
subset of a larger physical network.

WiMAX: A wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) technology based on the IEEE 802.16 family
of standards used for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, fixed last-mile broadband access,
long-range wireless backhaul, and access layer technology for mobile wireless subscribers operating on
telecommunications networks.
