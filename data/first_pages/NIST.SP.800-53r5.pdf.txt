                                                                                                       Once exfiltrated, there is generally no way for the organization to recover the lost information.
                                                                                                       Therefore, organizations may consider dividing the information into disparate elements and

                                                                                                       and, in so doing, increase the probability of detection. The fragmentation of information impacts
