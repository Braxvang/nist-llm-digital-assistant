                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

                                                Authority

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347. NIST is
responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.
Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130, Appendix III.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.
This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of
standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the
extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of
federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards
that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve
the security of federal information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of
          Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies.2 FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these
          standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and
          guidance documents. For other than national security programs and systems, federal
          agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information
          Processing Standard. FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as
          amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA
          and Agency Privacy Management), state that for other than national security programs
          and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications.3
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL
          Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These
          publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
     •    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by
          OMB.

 The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and
national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.
2
 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances
where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.
3
  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB
policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies should apply the security concepts and
principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions,
business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies
can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB
definition of adequate security for federal information systems. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST
Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators, auditors, and assessors, should consider the intent of the security
concepts and principles articulated within the specific guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in
the context of its mission/business responsibilities, operational environment, and unique organizational conditions.

                                             Postscript
    Making any significant changes to the publication without public review is not in keeping
    with the obligation we have to the public and private sector organizations employing the
    NIST standards and guidelines. Some thoughtful and insightful recommendations received
    during the final public comment period suggesting changes to the publication have been
    retained and deferred until the next major revision to Special Publication 800-53. We
    continue to balance the need for stability in the NIST publications to ensure cost-effective
    implementation with the need to keep the publications current.

                                       FIPS 200 AND SP 800-53
                         IMPLEMENTING INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

    FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, is a
    mandatory federal standard developed by NIST in response to FISMA. To comply with the federal
    standard, organizations must first determine the security category of their information system in
    accordance with FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
    Information Systems, derive the information system impact level from the security category in
    accordance with FIPS 200, and then apply the appropriately tailored set of baseline security
    controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
    and Organizations. Organizations have flexibility in applying the baseline security controls in
    accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. This allows organizations to
    tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely aligns with their mission and
    business requirements and environments of operation.
    FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, in combination, help ensure that appropriate
    security requirements and security controls are applied to all federal information and information
    systems. An organizational assessment of risk validates the initial security control selection and
    determines if any additional controls are needed to protect organizational operations (including
    mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or
    the Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of security due diligence for the
    organization.

                   DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                             COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

  In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal agencies
  and offices as well as the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
  duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST publications are complementary with the standards and
  guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to its comprehensive
  public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National
  Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Committee on National Security
  Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal
  government. A common foundation for information security will provide the Intelligence, Defense,
  and Civil sectors of the federal government and their support contractors, more uniform and consistent
  ways to manage the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation that results from the operation and use of information systems. A common foundation for
  information security will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of security authorization
  decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with public and private sector
  entities to establish specific mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines
  developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization and International
  Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001, Information Security Management System (ISMS).

“…Through the process of risk management, leaders must consider risk to US interests from
adversaries using cyberspace to their advantage and from our own efforts to employ the global
nature of cyberspace to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations… “
 “…For operational plans development, the combination of threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
must be evaluated in order to identify important trends and decide where effort should be applied
to eliminate or reduce threat capabilities; eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities; and assess,
coordinate, and deconflict all cyberspace operations…”
“…Leaders at all levels are accountable for ensuring readiness and security to the same degree
as in any other domain…"

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR SECURITY CONTROLS TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T
       he selection and implementation of appropriate security controls for an information
       system4 or a system-of-systems5 are important tasks that can have major implications on
       the operations6 and assets of an organization7 as well as the welfare of individuals and the
Nation. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or
countermeasures employed within an organizational information system to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. There are several
important questions that should be answered by organizational officials when addressing the
security considerations for their information systems:
•      What security controls are needed to adequately mitigate the risk incurred by the use of
       information and information systems in the execution of organizational missions and business
       functions?
•      Have the selected security controls been implemented or is there a realistic plan for their
       implementation?
•      What is the desired or required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the
       selected security controls, as implemented, are effective8 in their application?

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
information security program for the organization that identifies, mitigates as deemed necessary,
and monitors on an ongoing basis, risks9 arising from its information and information systems.
The security controls defined in this publication and recommended for use by organizations in
protecting their information systems should be employed in conjunction with and as part of a
well-defined and documented information security program. The program management controls
(Appendix G), complement the security controls for an information system (Appendix F) by
focusing on the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any
particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.

4
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and
environmental control systems.
5
  In certain situations within an organization, an information system can be viewed from both a logical and physical
perspective as a complex system-of-systems (e.g., Federal Aviation Administration National Air Space System) when
there are multiple information systems involved with a high degree of connectivity and interaction among the systems.
6
    Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.
7
  The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).
8
  Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information
system in its operational environment.
9
  Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a
function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of
occurrence. Information system-related security risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of information or information systems and consider the adverse impacts to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                           PAGE 1
Special Publication 800-53             Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


It is of paramount importance that responsible officials understand the risks and other factors that
could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation.10 These officials must also understand the current status of their security programs
and the security controls planned or in place to protect their information and information systems
in order to make informed judgments and investments that mitigate risks to an acceptable level.
The ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and to
accomplish the organization’s stated missions and business functions with what the OMB
Circular A-130 defines as adequate security, or security commensurate with risk resulting from
the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government to
meet the requirements of FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and
Information Systems. The guidelines apply to all components11 of an information system that
process, store, or transmit federal information. The guidelines have been developed to help
achieve more secure information systems and effective risk management within the federal
government by:
•      Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
       specifying security controls for information systems and organizations;
•      Providing a recommendation for minimum security controls for information systems
       categorized in accordance with FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
       Information and Information Systems;
•      Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls for information systems and
       organizations to meet current organizational protection needs and the demands of future
       protection needs based on changing requirements and technologies;
•      Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
       determining security control effectiveness; and
•      Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that
       supports discussion of risk management concepts.

The guidelines in this special publication are applicable to all federal information systems12 other
than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542.
The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar
guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of
appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.13 State, local, and
tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these
guidelines, as appropriate.

10
     Includes risk to U.S. critical infrastructure/key resources as described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7.
11
  Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic
mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and
data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.
12
   A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
13
  CNSS Instruction 1253 provides implementing guidance for NIST Special Publication 800-53 for national security
systems.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information
security professionals including:
•    Individuals with information system or security management and oversight responsibilities
     (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers,14
     information system managers, information security managers);
•    Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program and project
     managers, information technology product developers, information system designers and
     developers, systems integrators);
•    Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
     mission/business owners, information system owners, common control providers, information
     owners/stewards, information system security engineers, information system administrators,
     information system security officers); and
•    Individuals with information system and information security assessment and monitoring
     responsibilities (e.g., auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors/assessment
     teams, independent verification and validation assessors, information system owners).

Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating
information security-related technologies, and providing information security services can also
benefit from the information in this publication.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create a technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for information
systems and organizations, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this
special publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial,
healthcare, and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by national and international
standards organizations. The objective of NIST Special Publication 800-53 is to provide a set of
security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements15 levied on
information systems and organizations and that is consistent with and complementary to other
established information security standards.

The catalog of security controls provided in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to
demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security
requirements. It is the responsibility of organizations to select the appropriate security controls,
to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in
satisfying their stated security requirements. The security controls in the catalog facilitate the
development of assessment methods and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control
effectiveness in a consistent and repeatable manner—thus contributing to the organization’s
confidence that there is ongoing compliance with its stated security requirements.16

14
   At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.
15
  Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.
16
   NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls defined in
this publication.

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations17 use FIPS 199 to categorize their information and information systems. Security
categorization is accomplished as an organization-wide activity18 with the involvement of senior-
level organizational officials including, for example, authorizing officials, chief information
officers, senior information security officers, information owners/stewards, information system
owners, and risk executive (function). As required by FIPS 200, organizations use the security
categorization results to designate information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-
impact systems. For each information system, the recommendation for minimum security
controls from Special Publication 800-53 (i.e., the baseline security controls defined in Appendix
D, adjusted in accordance with the tailoring guidance in Section 3.3) is intended to be used as a
starting point for and as input to the organization’s security control supplementation process.19

While the FIPS 199 security categorization associates the operation of the information system
with the potential adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation,20 the incorporation of refined threat and vulnerability information
during the risk assessment facilitates the selection of additional security controls supplementing
the tailored baseline to address specific organizational needs and tolerance for risk. The final,
agreed-upon21 set of security controls is documented with appropriate rationale in the security
plan for the information system. The use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53
and the incorporation of tailored baseline controls as a starting point in the control selection
process, facilitate a more consistent level of security across federal information systems and
organizations. It also offers the needed flexibility to appropriately modify the controls based on
specific organizational policies and requirements, particular conditions and circumstances, known
threat and vulnerability information, and tolerance for risk.

Building more secure information systems is a multifaceted undertaking that requires:
•      Well-defined security requirements and security specifications;
•      Well-designed and well-built information technology products;
•      Sound systems/security engineering principles and practices to effectively integrate
       information technology products into information systems;
•      State-of-the-art techniques and methods for information technology product/information
       system assessment; and
•      Comprehensive system security planning and life cycle management.22


17
  An organization typically exercises managerial, operational, and/or financial control over its information systems and
the security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement or require the security
controls deemed necessary by the organization to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.
18
     See FIPS Publication 200, footnote 7.
19
  Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of an organization. NIST
Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk as part of an overall risk management process.
20
  Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives.
21
   The authorizing official or designated representative, by accepting the security plan, agrees to the set of security
controls proposed to meet the security requirements for the information system.
22
     NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on security considerations in life cycle management.

From a systems engineering viewpoint, security is just one of many required operational
capabilities for an information system supporting organizational mission/business processes—
capabilities that must be funded by the organization throughout the life cycle of the system in
order to achieve mission/business success. It is important that the organization realistically
assesses the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
Nation that arises by placing the information system into operation or continuing its operation.

In addition, information security requirements for organizational information systems must be
satisfied with full consideration of the risk management strategy23 of the organization, in light of
the potential cost, schedule, and performance issues associated with the acquisition, deployment,
and operation of the information system.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE




T     his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
      and specification including: (i) the structure of security controls and the organization of the
      controls in the control catalog; (ii) security control baselines; (iii) the identification and use
of common security controls; (iv) security controls in external environments; (v) security control
assurance; and (vi) future revisions to the security controls, the control catalog, and baseline
controls.

2.1 SECURITY CONTROL ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
Security controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure.
For ease of use in the security control selection and specification process, controls are organized
into eighteen families.24 Each security control family contains security controls related to the
security functionality of the family. A two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify
each security control family. In addition, there are three general classes of security controls:
management, operational, and technical.25 Table 1-1 summarizes the classes and families in the
security control catalog and the associated security control family identifiers.

   Of the eighteen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53, seventeen families are described in the
security control catalog in Appendix F, and are closely aligned with the seventeen minimum security requirements for
federal information and information systems in FIPS 200. One additional family (Program Management [PM] family)
in Appendix G provides controls for information security programs. This family, while not referenced in FIPS 200,
provides security controls at the organizational rather than the information-system level.
25
     A control family is associated with a given class based on the dominant characteristics of the controls in that family.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                             PAGE 6
Special Publication 800-53           Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


To identify each security control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to
indicate the number of the control within the family. For example, CP-9 is the ninth control in
the Contingency Planning family and AC-2 is the second control in the Access Control family.

The security control structure consists of the following components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; (iii) a control enhancements section; (iv) a references section;
and (v) a priority and baseline allocation section. The following example from the Auditing and
Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security control.
AU-5     RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES

         Control: The information system:

         a.      Alerts designated organizational officials in the event of an audit processing failure; and
         b.      Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be taken
                 (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit records, stop generating audit
                 records)].
         Supplemental Guidance: Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
         failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
         Related control: AU-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)     The information system provides a warning when allocated audit record storage volume reaches
                 [Assignment: organization-defined percentage of maximum audit record storage capacity].
         (2)     The information system provides a real-time alert when the following audit failure events occur:
                 [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts].
         (3)     The information system enforces configurable traffic volume thresholds representing auditing
                 capacity for network traffic and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those thresholds.
         (4)     The information system invokes a system shutdown in the event of an audit failure, unless an
                 alternative audit capability exists.
         References: None.
         Priority and Baseline Allocation:


            P1     LOW AU-5                          MOD AU-5                         HIGH AU-5 (1) (2)


The control section provides a concise statement of the specific security capabilities needed to
protect a particular aspect of an information system.26 The control statement describes specific
security-related activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information
system. For some security controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by
allowing organizations to selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with
the controls. This flexibility is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations
within the control (see Section 3.3). Assignment and selection operations provide an opportunity
for an organization to tailor the security controls to support specific mission, business, or
operational needs. For example, an organization can specify the actions to be taken by the
information system in the event of an audit processing failure (see AU-5 example above), the
specific events to be audited within the system, the frequency of conducting system backups,
restrictions on password use, or the distribution list for organizational policies and procedures.27

26
  Security controls are generally designed to be technology and implementation independent and therefore, do not
contain specific requirements in these areas. Organizations provide such requirements as deemed necessary in the
security plan for the information system.
27
  The organization determines whether a specific assignment or selection operation is completed at the organizational
level, information system level, or a combination of the two.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 7
Special Publication 800-53           Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Once specified, the organization-defined values become part of the control, and the control
implementation is assessed against the completed control statement. Selection statements narrow
the potential input values by providing a specific list of items from which the organization must
choose.

The supplemental guidance28 section provides additional information related to a specific security
control, but contains no requirements. Organizations are expected to apply the supplemental
guidance as appropriate, when defining, developing, and implementing security controls. The
supplemental guidance provides important considerations for implementing security controls in
the context of an organization’s operational environment, mission requirements, or assessment of
risk. Security control enhancements may also contain supplemental guidance. Enhancement
supplemental guidance is used in situations where the guidance is not generally applicable to the
entire control but instead focused on the particular control enhancement.

The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build
in additional functionality to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both
cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring greater protection
due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to the basic control
functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are numbered
sequentially within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected
to supplement the basic control. In the previous example for AU-5, if the first three control
enhancements are selected, the control designation becomes AU-5 (1) (2) (3).29 The numerical
designation of a security control enhancement is used only to identify a particular enhancement
within the control structure. The designation is neither indicative of the relative strength of the
control enhancement nor assumes any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements.

The references section30 includes a list of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, and guidelines (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST Special Publications),
that are relevant to a particular security control or control enhancement.31 The references provide
appropriate federal legislative and policy mandates as well as supporting information for the
implementation of specific management, operational, or technical controls/enhancements. The
references section also contains pertinent websites for organizations to use in obtaining additional
information with regard to security control implementation and assessment.

The priority and baseline allocation section provides: (i) the recommended priority codes used for
sequencing decisions during security control implementation (see Appendix D); and (ii) the initial
allocation of security controls and control enhancements for low-impact, moderate-impact, and
high-impact information systems (see Appendix F).



28
   The supplemental guidance section may contain information on related controls (i.e., security controls that either
directly impact or support the control). For example, AC-6 (Least Privilege) is a related control to AC-3 (Access
Control Enforcement) because AC-6 is a source for some of the authorizations to be enforced by AC-3.
29
  AU-5 Enhancement (3) is an example of a requirement in the security control catalog (Appendix F) that is not in any
of the control baselines (Appendix D). Such requirements can be used by organizations in supplementing the tailored
baselines as described in Section 3.3 in order to achieve what the organization deems to be adequate risk mitigation.
30
  Publications listed in the References section of security controls refer to the most recent versions of the publications.
Organizations confirm from the respective official sources of the publications (e.g., OMB, NIST, NARA), that the most
recent versions are being used for organizational application.
31
  The references listed in the security control references section are provided to assist organizations in applying the
controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.2 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and
information systems in the execution of missions and business functions. A significant challenge
for organizations is to determine the appropriate set of security controls, which if implemented
and determined to be effective, would most cost-effectively mitigate risk while complying with
the security requirements defined by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., FISMA, OMB Circular A-130). Selecting the appropriate
set of security controls to adequately mitigate risk by meeting the specific, and sometimes unique,
security requirements of an organization is an important task—a task that clearly demonstrates
the organization’s commitment to security and the due diligence exercised in protecting the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and information systems.

To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for an information
system, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the starting point for
the security control selection process described in this document and are chosen based on the
security category and associated impact level of the information system determined in accordance
with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200, respectively. The tailored security control baseline (i.e., the
appropriate control baseline from Appendix D adjusted in accordance with the guidance in
Section 3.3) is the minimum set of security controls for the information system. Because the
baseline is intended to be a broadly applicable starting point, supplements to the tailored baseline
(see Section 3.3) will likely be necessary in order to achieve adequate risk mitigation. The
tailored security control baseline is supplemented based on an organizational assessment of risk
and the resulting controls documented in the security plan for the information system.

Appendix D provides a listing of baseline security controls. Three sets of baseline controls have
been identified corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information-
system levels defined in FIPS 200 and used in Section 3.2 of this document to provide an initial
set of security controls for each impact level.32 Appendix F provides a detailed catalog of security
controls for information systems, arranged by control families. Chapter Three provides additional
information on how to use FIPS 199 security categories and FIPS 200 impact levels in applying
the tailoring guidance to the baseline security controls and supplementing the tailored baseline in
order to achieve adequate risk mitigation.


                                            Implementation Tip
 There are additional security controls and control enhancements that appear in the security control
 catalog (Appendix F) that are found in only higher-impact baselines or not used in any of the baselines.
 These additional security controls and control enhancements for the information system are available to
 organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to achieve the needed level of
 protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. Moreover, security controls and
 control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be used to strengthen the level of
 protection provided in lower-level baselines, if deemed appropriate. At the end of the security control
 selection process, the agreed-upon set of controls in the security plan must be sufficient to adequately
 mitigate risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.




32
   The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the tailoring guidance
described in Section 3.3 provides organizations with the ability to eliminate certain controls or specify compensating
controls in accordance with the terms and conditions established by authorizing officials.

2.3 COMMON CONTROLS
Common controls are security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational
information systems.33 The organization assigns responsibility for common controls to
appropriate organizational officials and coordinates the development, implementation,
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the controls.34 The identification of common
controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active
involvement of the chief information officer, senior information security officer, risk executive
(function), authorizing officials, information system owners, information owners/stewards, and
information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the security
categories and associated impact levels of the information systems within the organization in
accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200, as well as the security controls necessary to adequately
mitigate the risks arising from the use of those systems (see baseline security controls in Section
2.2).35 For example, common controls can be identified for all low-impact information systems
by considering the associated baseline security controls in Appendix D. Similar exercises can be
conducted for moderate-impact and high-impact information systems as well. When common
controls protect multiple organizational information systems of differing impact levels, the
controls are implemented with regard to the highest impact level among the systems.

Many of the security controls needed to protect organizational information systems (e.g.,
contingency planning controls, incident response controls, security training and awareness
controls, personnel security controls, physical and environmental protection controls, and
intrusion detection controls) are excellent candidates for common control status. Information
security program management controls (see Appendix G, PM family) may also be deemed
common controls by the organization since the controls are employed at the organization level
and typically serve multiple information systems. By centrally managing and documenting the
development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of common controls,
security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems.

Common controls are generally documented in the organization-wide information security
program plan unless implemented as part of a specific information system, in which case the
controls are documented in the security plan for that system.36 Organizations have the flexibility
to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of
multiple documents, the documents describing the common controls are included as attachments
to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains
multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or
officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that

33
   A security control is inheritable by an information system or application when that system or application receives
protection from the security control (or portions of the security control) and the control is developed, implemented,
assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the system or application—entities
either internal or external to the organization where the system or application resides.
34
   The Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer, or other designated organizational officials at
the senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
monitoring of common controls to appropriate entities (either internal or external to the organization). Organizational
entities assigned responsibility for common controls use the Risk Management Framework described in Chapter Three
to help ensure appropriate security capabilities are provided.
35
   Each common control identified by the organization is reviewed for applicability to each specific organizational
information system.
36
     Information security program plans are described in Appendix G.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                        PAGE 10
Special Publication 800-53           Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously
monitor physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls
are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple systems.
When common controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing boundary protection
inherited by one or more organizational information systems), the information security program
plan indicates which separate security plan contains a description of the common controls.

Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls or
hybrid controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system
owners and their respective authorizing officials. Organizations assign a hybrid status to a
security control when one part of the control is deemed to be common and another part of the
control is deemed to be system-specific. For example, an organization may implement the
Incident Response Policy and Procedures security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the
policy portion of the control deemed to be common and the procedures portion of the control
deemed to be system-specific. Hybrid controls may also serve as templates for further control
refinement. An organization may choose, for example, to implement the Contingency Planning
security control (CP-2) as a template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational
information systems with individual information system owners tailoring the plan, where
appropriate, for system-specific uses. Partitioning security controls into common, hybrid, and
system-specific controls can result in significant savings to the organization in implementation
and assessment costs as well as a more consistent application of the security controls across the
organization. While the concept of security control partitioning into common, hybrid, and
system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application within an organization
takes significant planning and coordination.

Security plans for individual information systems identify which security controls required for
those systems have been designated by the organization as common controls and which controls
have been designated as system-specific or hybrid controls. Information system owners are
responsible for any system-specific implementation details associated with an organization’s
common controls. These implementation details are identified and described in the security plans
for the individual information systems. The senior information security officer for the
organization coordinates with common control providers (e.g., facilities/site manager, human
resources manager, intrusion detection system owner) to ensure that the required controls are
developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness. The security plans for individual
information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together,
provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization.

Common controls, whether employed in an information system or in the environment of
operation, are authorized by a senior organizational official37 with at least the same level of
authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization officials for information
systems inheriting the controls.38 Authorization results relating to common controls are shared
with the appropriate information system owners. A plan of action and milestones is developed
and maintained for the common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less than
effective. Common controls are subject to the same continuous monitoring requirements as
system-specific security controls employed in individual organizational information systems.

37
 The authorizing official role, whether applied to information systems or common controls, has inherent U.S.
Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.
38
     When common controls are inherited from external environments, organizations should consult Section 2.4.

                                                 Implementation Tip
     The selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis with
     the involvement of the organization’s senior leadership (i.e., authorizing officials, chief information officer,
     senior information security officer, information system owners, mission/business owners, information
     owners/stewards, risk executive [function]). These individuals have the collective corporate knowledge
     to understand the organization’s priorities, the importance of the organization’s operations and assets,
     and the relative importance of the organizational information systems that support those operations and
     assets. The organization’s senior leaders are also in the best position to select the common controls for
     each security control baseline and assign organizational responsibilities for developing, implementing,
     assessing, authorizing, and monitoring those controls.




2.4 SECURITY CONTROLS IN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS
Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by
external providers to carry out important missions and business functions. External information
system services are services implemented outside of the authorization boundaries established by
the organization for its information systems. These external services may be used by, but are not
part of, organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system
services may completely replace the functionality of internal information systems. Organizations
are responsible and accountable for the risk incurred by use of services provided by external
providers and address this risk by implementing compensating controls when the risk is greater
than the authorizing official or the organization is willing to accept.

Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example,
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply
chain exchanges. The growing dependence on external service providers and new relationships
being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for the organization,
especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:
•      Defining the types of external services provided to the organization;
•      Describing how the external services are protected in accordance with the security
       requirements of the organization; and
•      Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets,
       individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services
       is acceptable.

FISMA and OMB policy require external providers handling federal information or operating
information systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same security requirements
as federal agencies. Security requirements for external providers including the security controls
for information systems processing, storing, or transmitting federal information are expressed in
appropriate contracts or other formal agreements using the Risk Management Framework and
associated NIST security standards and guidelines described in Chapter Three. Organizations can
require external providers to implement all steps in the Risk Management Framework described
in Chapter Three with the exception of the security authorization step, which remains an inherent
federal responsibility that is directly linked to the management of risk related to the use of
external information system services.39

39
     See Implementation Tip in Section 3.3 for applying the Risk management Framework to external service providers.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                      PAGE 12
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


The assurance or confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level
depends on the trust40 that the organization places in the external service provider. In some cases,
the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the organization is able to exert on the
external service provider with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the
protection of the service and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.
The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-
level agreement with the external service provider and can range from extensive (e.g., negotiating
a contract or agreement that specifies detailed security control requirements for the provider) to
very limited (e.g., using a contract or service-level agreement to obtain commodity services41
such as commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, the level of trust is based on
factors that convince the organization that the requisite security controls have been employed and
that a credible determination of control effectiveness exists. For example, a separately authorized
external information system service provided to an organization through a well-established line of
business relationship may provide a degree of trust in the external service within the tolerable risk
range of the authorizing official.

The provision of services by external providers may result in some services without explicit
agreements between the organization and the external entities responsible for the services.
Whenever explicit agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level
agreements, etc.), the organization develops such agreements and requires the use of the security
controls in Special Publication 800-53. When the organization is not in a position to require
explicit agreements with external providers (e.g., the service is imposed on the organization or the
service is commodity service), the organization establishes explicit assumptions about the service
capabilities with regard to security.42 Contracts between the organization and external providers
may also require the active participation of the organization. For example, the organization may
be required by the contract to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended
by the service provider.

Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of
external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Organizations require
that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with
the many issues associated with information system security. A chain of trust requires that the

40
  The level of trust that an organization places in an external service provider can vary widely, ranging from those who
are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector).
41
  Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the
concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain
fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating
security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.
The organization’s risk assessment and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation.
42
   In situations where an organization is procuring information system services or technologies through a centralized
acquisition vehicle (e.g., governmentwide contract by the General Services Administration or other preferred and/or
mandatory acquisition organization), it may be more efficient and cost-effective for the originator of the contract to
establish and maintain a stated level of trust with the external provider (including the definition of required security
controls and level of assurance with regard to the provision of such controls). Organizations subsequently acquiring
information system services or technologies from the centralized contract can take advantage of the negotiated trust
level established by the procurement originator and thus avoid costly repetition of the activities necessary to establish
such trust. For example, a procurement originator could authorize an information system providing external services to
the federal government under specific terms and conditions of the contract. A federal agency requesting information
system services under the terms of the contract would not be required to reauthorize the information system when
acquiring such services (unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contract).



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                         PAGE 13

organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service provider in
the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the
services rendered to the organization. The chain of trust can be complicated due to the number of
entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the type of relationship between
the parties. External service providers may also in turn outsource the services to other external
entities, making the chain of trust even more complicated and difficult to manage. Depending on
the nature of the service, it may simply be unwise for the organization to place significant trust in
the provider—not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the provider's part, but due to the
intrinsic level of risk in the service. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the
external services and/or service providers, the organization employs compensating controls or
accepts a greater degree of risk.

2.5 SECURITY CONTROL ASSURANCE
Assurance is the grounds for confidence that the security controls implemented within an
information system are effective in their application. Assurance can be obtained in a variety of
ways including:
•    Actions taken by developers, implementers, and operators in the specification, design,
     development, implementation, operation, and maintenance of security controls;43 and
•    Actions taken by security control assessors to determine the extent to which the controls are
     implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
     respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.

Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements44 for security controls in low-impact,
moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems. For security controls in low-impact
systems, the emphasis is on the control being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors
exist and that as flaws are discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner. For security
controls in moderate-impact systems, in addition to the assurance requirements for low-impact
systems, the emphasis is on increasing the grounds for confidence in control correctness. While
flaws are still likely to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer or
control implementer incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities to increase grounds
for confidence that the control meets its function or purpose. For security controls in high-impact
systems, in addition to the assurance requirements for moderate-impact systems, the emphasis is
on requiring within the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing, consistent
operation of the control and to support continuous improvement in the control’s effectiveness.
There are additional assurance requirements available to developers/implementers of security
controls supplementing the minimum assurance requirements for the moderate-impact and high-
impact information systems in order to protect against threats from highly skilled, highly
motivated, and well-resourced threat agents. This level of protection is necessary for those
information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the risks associated with the
type of threat agents cited above.




43
   In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls. This may include in addition to organizational personnel, for example, hardware
and software vendors providing the security controls and contractors implementing the controls.
44
   Assurance requirements imposed upon developers and implementers of security controls are addressed in this special
publication. Assurance gained from the assessment of security controls (e.g., by testers, evaluators, auditors, Inspectors
General, information system owners) is addressed in NIST Special Publication 800-53A.

2.6 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The set of security controls listed in this publication represents the current state-of-the-practice
safeguards and countermeasures for federal information systems and organizations. The security
controls will be carefully reviewed and revised periodically to reflect:
•    Experience gained from using the controls;
•    Changing security requirements;
•    Emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods; and
•    Availability of new technologies.45

The security controls in the security control catalog are expected to change over time, as controls
are withdrawn, revised, and added. The security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high
baselines are also expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for
mitigating risks within organizations changes. In addition to the need for change, the need for
stability will be addressed by requiring that proposed additions, deletions, or modifications to the
catalog of security controls go through a rigorous public review process to obtain government and
private sector feedback and to build consensus for the changes. A stable, yet flexible and
technically rigorous set of security controls will be maintained in the security control catalog.




45
  The security control catalog in Appendix F will be updated as needed with new controls developed from national-
level threat databases containing information on known cyber attacks. The proposed modifications to security controls
and security control baselines will be carefully weighed with each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability on
one hand, and the need to respond to changing threats and vulnerabilities, new attack methods, new technologies, and
the important objective of raising the foundational level of security over time. Organizations may develop new controls
when appropriate controls are not available in Appendix F.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS




T
        his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for an
        organizational information system to include: (i) applying the organization’s approach to
        managing risk; (ii) categorizing the information system and determining the system impact
level in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200, respectively; (iii) selecting security controls,
including tailoring the initial set of baseline security controls and supplementing the tailored
baseline as necessary based on an organizational assessment of risk; and (iv) assessing the
security controls as part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process.

3.1 MANAGING RISK
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program for the management of risk—that is,
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
associated with the operation of an information system. The management of risk is a key element
in the organization’s information security program and provides an effective framework for
selecting the appropriate security controls for an information system—the security controls
necessary to protect individuals and the operations and assets of the organization. The risk-based
approach to security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and
constraints due to applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, or guidelines. The following activities related to managing risk, included as part of the
Risk Management Framework, are paramount to an effective information security program and
can be applied to both new and legacy information systems within the context of the Federal
Enterprise Architecture and system development life cycle—
•      Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by
       that system based on a FIPS 199 impact analysis.
•      Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the
       system impact level and minimum security requirements defined in FIPS 200; apply tailoring
       guidance;46 supplement the tailored baseline security controls based on an organizational
       assessment of risk47 and local conditions including environment of operation, organization-
       specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, or special
       circumstances; and specify assurance requirements.
•      Implement the security controls and describe how the controls are employed within the
       information system and its environment of operation.48
•      Assess the security controls using appropriate assessment procedures to determine the extent
       to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
       desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.49

46
  Tailoring guidance provides organizations with specific considerations on the applicability and implementation of
individual security controls in the control baselines (see Section 3.3).
47
     NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk.
48
     For legacy systems, some or all of the security controls selected may already be implemented.
49
     NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls.

•      Authorize information system operation based on a determination of the risk to
       organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
       resulting from the operation of the information system and the decision that this risk is
       acceptable.50
•      Monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis including
       assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or its environment of
       operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the
       security state of the system to designated organizational officials.

Figure 3-1 illustrates the specific activities in the Risk Management Framework and the
information security standards and guidance documents associated with each activity.51 The
remainder of this chapter focuses on several key activities in the Risk Management Framework
associated with security control selection and specification.

3.2 CATEGORIZING THE INFORMATION SYSTEM
FIPS 199, the mandatory security categorization standard, is predicated on a simple and well-
established concept—determining appropriate security priorities for organizational information
systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to adequately protect those systems.
The security controls applied to a particular information system are commensurate with the
potential adverse impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation should there be a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
FIPS 199 requires organizations to categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-
impact, or high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability
(RMF Step 1). The potential impact values assigned to the respective security objectives are the
highest values (i.e., high water mark) from among the security categories that have been
determined for each type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by those information
systems.52 The generalized format for expressing the security category (SC) of an information
system is:
          SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
                    where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept is introduced in FIPS
200 to determine the impact level of the information system for the express purpose of selecting
an initial set of security controls from one of the three security control baselines.53 Thus, a low-
impact system is defined as an information system in which all three of the security objectives are
low. A moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least one of the security
objectives is moderate and no security objective is greater than moderate. And finally, a high-
impact system is an information system in which at least one security objective is high.

                                             Implementation Tip
  To determine the overall impact level of the information system:
  •    First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the
       information system (e.g., financial sector oversight, inspections and auditing, official information
       dissemination, etc.). NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides guidance on a variety of information
       types commonly used by organizations.
  •    Second, using the impact levels in FIPS 199 and the recommendations of NIST Special Publication
       800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each information type.
  •    Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact level for
       each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations for the
       information types associated with the information system.
  •    Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact level
       among the three security objectives in the system security categorization.




52
   NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.
53
   The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, the security controls in the control catalog are not categorized by
security objective—rather, they are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of
information systems based on impact level. The application of scoping guidance may allow selective security control
baseline tailoring based on the individual impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (see Section 3.3).



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                            PAGE 18

________________________________________________________________________________________________


3.3 SELECTING SECURITY CONTROLS
Once the impact level of the information system is determined, the organization begins the
security control selection process (RMF Step 2). There are three steps in the control selection
process carried out sequentially: (i) selecting the initial set of baseline security controls; (ii)
tailoring the baseline security controls; and (iii) supplementing the tailored baseline. The
following sections describe each of these steps in greater detail.54

Selecting the Initial Baseline Security Controls
The first step in selecting security controls for the information system is to choose the appropriate
set of baseline controls. The selection of the initial set of baseline security controls is based on
the impact level of the information system as determined by the security categorization process
described in Section 3.2. The organization selects one of three sets of baseline security controls
from Appendix D corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact rating of the
information system. Note that not all security controls are assigned to baselines, as indicated by
the phrase not selected. Similarly, not all control enhancements are assigned to baselines, as
indicated by the security control being not selected or the enhancement number enclosed in
parenthesis, not appearing in any baseline.

Tailoring the Baseline Security Controls
After selecting the initial set of baseline security controls from Appendix D, the organization
initiates the tailoring process to appropriately modify and more closely align the controls with the
specific conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions specific to the information system or
its environment of operation). The tailoring process includes:
•    Applying scoping guidance to the initial baseline security controls to obtain a preliminary set
     of applicable controls for the tailored baseline;
•    Selecting (or specifying) compensating security controls, if needed, to adjust the preliminary
     set of controls to obtain an equivalent set deemed to be more feasible to implement; and
•    Specifying organization-defined parameters in the security controls via explicit assignment
     and selection statements to complete the definition of the tailored baseline.

To achieve a cost-effective, risk-based approach to providing adequate information security
organization-wide, the baseline tailoring activities are coordinated with and approved by
appropriate organizational officials (e.g., authorizing officials, authorizing official designated
representatives, risk executive (function), chief information officers, or senior information
security officers) prior to implementing the security controls. Organizations have the flexibility
to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information systems (either as the
required tailored baseline or as the starting point for system-specific tailoring), at the individual
information system level, or using a combination of organization-level and system-specific
approaches. Tailoring decisions for all affected security controls in the selected baseline,
including the specific rationale for those decisions, are documented in the security plan for the
information system and approved by appropriate organizational officials as part of the security
plan approval process.55

54
  The general security control selection process may be augmented or further detailed by additional sector-specific
guidance such as that provided for industrial control systems in Appendix I.
55
  The level of detail required in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is strictly at
the discretion of the organization and is consistent with the impact level of the information system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides organizations with specific terms and conditions on the applicability
and implementation of individual security controls in the security control baselines. Application
of scoping guidance helps to ensure that organizations implement only those controls that are
essential to providing the appropriate level of protection for the information system based on
specific mission/business requirements and particular environments of operation. There are
several scoping considerations described below, that can potentially affect how the baseline
security controls are applied and implemented by organizations:

•    COMMON CONTROL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls designated by the organization as common controls are, in most cases,
     managed by an organizational entity other than the information system owner.
     Organizational decisions on which security controls are viewed as common controls may
     greatly affect the responsibilities of individual information system owners with regard to the
     implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Every security control in the tailored and
     supplemented set of controls for an information system is identified in the security plan as a
     common, system-specific, or hybrid control (see Section 2.3).

•    SECURITY OBJECTIVE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls that support only one or two of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
     security objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
     modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) if, and only if, the downgrading
     action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS 199 security category for the supported security
     objective(s) before moving to the FIPS 200 impact level (i.e., high water mark);56 (ii) is
     supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii) does not adversely affect the level
     of protection for the security-relevant information within the information system.57 The
     following security controls are recommended candidates for downgrading: (i) confidentiality
     [MA-3 (3), MP-2 (1), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5 (1) (2) (3), MP-6, PE-5, SC-4, SC-9]; (ii) integrity
     [SC-8]; and (iii) availability [CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-
     11, PE-13, PE-15, SC-6].58


56
   When applying the “high water mark” process in Section 3.2, some of the original FIPS 199 confidentiality, integrity,
or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher baseline of security controls. As part of this
process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
57
  Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables, cryptographic
key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within an information system. Certain
security controls within an information system are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and
integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality
or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the downgrading action does not result in insufficient protection for
the security-relevant information within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the
high water mark in order to achieve that level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level
information.
58
   Downgrading actions apply only to the moderate and high baselines. Certain security controls that are uniquely
attributable to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for
downgrading (e.g., AC-16, AU-10, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, PL-5, SC-5, SC-13, SC-14, SC-16) are eliminated from
consideration because the controls are either selected for use in all baselines and have no enhancements that could be
downgraded, or the controls are optional and not selected for use in any baseline. Organizations should exercise
caution when considering downgrading security controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.3 to ensure that the
downgrading action does not affect security objectives other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    SYSTEM COMPONENT ALLOCATION-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls in the baseline represent an information system-wide set of controls that
     may not be necessary for or applicable to every component in the system. Security controls
     are applicable only to the components of the information system that provide or support the
     security capability addressed by the control and are sources of potential risk being mitigated
     by the control. For example, auditing controls are typically allocated to components of an
     information system that provide auditing capability (e.g., servers, etc.) and are not necessarily
     applied to every user-level workstation within the organization; or when information system
     components are single-user, not networked, or part of a physically isolated network, one or
     more of these characteristics may provide appropriate rationale for not allocating selected
     controls to that component. Organizations assess the inventory of information system
     components to determine which security controls are applicable to the various components
     and subsequently make explicit decisions regarding where to allocate the controls in order to
     satisfy organizational security requirements.59

•    TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
     infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
     employed within the information system. Security controls that can be supported by
     automated mechanisms do not require the development of such mechanisms if the
     mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government
     off-the-shelf products. For example, automated mechanisms may be used to maintain up-to-
     date, complete, accurate, and readily available baseline configurations of organizational
     information systems. If automated mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or
     technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated
     mechanisms or procedures, are used to satisfy specified security control requirements (see
     terms and conditions for selecting and applying compensating controls below).

•    PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls that refer to organizational facilities (e.g., physical controls such as locks
     and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting, fire, and power) are
     applicable only to those sections of the facilities that directly provide protection to, support
     for, or are related to the information system (including its information technology assets such
     as electronic mail or web servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, workstations,
     boundary protection devices, and communications equipment).

•    POLICY/REGULATORY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls that address matters governed by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
     directives, policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., privacy impact assessments) are required
     only if the employment of those controls is consistent with the types of information and
     information systems covered by the applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
     standards, or regulations.


59
   As technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in such devices as personal digital
assistants and cellular telephones. These devices may require the application of security controls in accordance with an
organizational assessment of risk. While the scoping guidance may support not allocating a particular security control
to a specific component, any residual risk associated with the absence of that control must be addressed to adequately
protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 21
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    OPERATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls that are based on specific assumptions about the operational environment
     are applicable only if the information system is employed in the assumed environment. For
     example, certain physical security controls may not be applicable to space-based information
     systems, and temperature and humidity controls may not be applicable to remote sensors that
     exist outside of the indoor facilities that contain information systems.

•    SCALABILITY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     Security controls are scalable with regard to the extent and rigor of the implementation.
     Scalability is guided by the FIPS 199 security categorization and associated FIPS 200 impact
     level of the information system being protected. For example, a contingency plan for a high-
     impact information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of
     implementation detail. In contrast, a contingency plan for a low-impact information system
     may be considerably shorter and contain much less implementation detail. Organizations use
     discretion in applying the security controls to information systems, giving consideration to
     the scalability factors in particular environments. This approach facilitates a cost-effective,
     risk-based approach to security control implementation that expends no more resources than
     necessary, yet achieves sufficient risk mitigation and adequate security.

•    PUBLIC ACCESS-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—
     When public access to organizational information systems is allowed, security controls are
     applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control baselines (e.g.,
     identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be applicable to public
     access. For example, while the baseline controls require identification and authentication of
     organizational personnel that maintain and support information systems providing the public
     access services, the same controls might not be required for access to those information
     systems through public interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other
     hand, identification and authentication would be required for users accessing information
     systems through public interfaces in some instances, for example, to access/change their
     personal information.

Compensating Security Controls
Organizations may find it necessary on occasion, to employ compensating security controls. This
may occur, for example, when an organization is unable to implement a security control in the
baseline or when, due to the specific nature of an information system or its environment of
operation, the control in the baseline is not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk
mitigation. A compensating security control is a management, operational, or technical control
(i.e., safeguard or countermeasure) employed by an organization in lieu of a recommended
security control in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in Appendix D, that provides an
equivalent or comparable level of protection for an information system and the information
processed, stored, or transmitted by that system.60 Compensating controls are typically selected
after applying the scoping considerations in the tailoring guidance to the initial set of baseline
security controls. For example, compensating controls may be needed by the organization when

60
  More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent or comparable protection for a
particular security control in NIST Special Publication 800-53. For example, an organization with significant staff
limitations may compensate for the separation of duty security control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and
personnel security controls within the information system. Acceptable compensating controls do not necessarily
require the development of new security controls.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                        PAGE 22
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


applying technology-based considerations addressing the lack of capability to support automated
mechanisms as part of a security control or control enhancement requirement. A compensating
control for an information system may be employed only under the following conditions:
•    The organization selects the compensating control from NIST Special Publication 800-53, or
     if an appropriate compensating control is not available, the organization adopts a suitable
     compensating control from another source;61
•    The organization provides supporting rationale for how the compensating control delivers an
     equivalent security capability for the information system and why the related baseline
     security control could not be employed; and
•    The organization assesses and formally accepts the risk associated with employing the
     compensating control in the information system.

Organization-Defined Security Control Parameters
Security controls containing organization-defined parameters (i.e., assignment and/or selection
operations) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of the controls to support
specific organizational requirements or objectives (see AU-5 example in Section 2.1). After the
application of scoping guidance and selection of compensating security controls, organizations
review the list of security controls for assignment and selection operations and determine the
appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Values for organization-
defined parameters are adhered to unless more restrictive values are prescribed by applicable
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidelines, or regulations.
Organizations may choose to specify values for security control parameters before selecting
compensating controls since the specification of those parameters completes the definition of the
security control and may affect the compensating control requirements.

Supplementing the Tailored Baseline
The tailored security control baseline is the foundation or starting point for determining the
needed set of security controls for an information system. As described in Section 3.1, the final
determination of the appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate security
for an information system is a function of the organization’s assessment of risk and what is
required to sufficiently mitigate the risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation.62 In many cases, additional security controls or control
enhancements will be needed to address specific threats to and vulnerabilities in an information
system and to satisfy the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations. The risk assessment at this stage in the security control
selection process provides important inputs to determine the sufficiency of the security controls in
the tailored baseline. Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of the security control
catalog in Appendix F to facilitate the process of enhancing security controls and/or adding
controls to the tailored baseline.63


61
   Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST
Special Publication 800-53. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only as a last resort when the
organization deems that the security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.
62
  Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives.
63
   Security controls and control enhancements selected to supplement tailored baselines are allocated to appropriate
information system components in the same manner as the control allocations carried out by the organization in the
initial baselines. See Section 3.3, Scoping Guidance, for security control allocation.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 23
Special Publication 800-53         Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


In selecting the security controls and control enhancements to supplement the tailored baseline,
an organization can employ a requirements definition approach or a gap analysis approach. In
the requirements definition approach, the organization acquires specific and credible threat64
information (or makes a reasonable assumption) about the activities of adversaries with certain
capabilities or attack potential (e.g., skill levels, expertise, available resources). To effectively
withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with the stated capabilities or attack potential, the
organization strives to achieve a certain level of security capability or cyber preparedness.
Organizations can choose additional security controls and control enhancements from Appendix
F to obtain such security capability or level of preparedness. In contrast to the requirements
definition approach, the gap analysis approach begins with an organizational assessment of its
current security capability or level of cyber preparedness. From that initial security capability
assessment, the organization determines the types of threats it can reasonably expect to address.
If the organization’s current security capability or level of cyber preparedness is insufficient, the
gap analysis determines the required capability and level of preparedness. The organization
subsequently defines the security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F needed to
achieve the desired capability or cyber preparedness level.65

There may be situations in which an organization is employing information technology beyond its
ability to adequately protect essential missions and business functions (e.g., certain web-based,
social networking, and collaborative computing-based technologies). That is, the organization
cannot apply sufficient security controls within an information system to adequately reduce or
mitigate risk. In those situations, an alternative strategy is needed to prevent the mission and
business functions from being adversely affected; a strategy that considers the mission/business
risks that result from an aggressive use of information technology. Restrictions on the types of
technologies used and how the information system is employed provide an alternative method to
reduce or mitigate risk when security controls cannot be implemented within technology/resource
constraints, or when controls lack reasonable expectation of effectiveness against identified threat
sources. Restrictions on the use of information systems and specific information technologies are
in many situations, the only practical or reasonable course of action an organization can take in
order to have the ability to carry out its assigned missions and business functions in the face of
determined adversaries. Examples of use restrictions include:
•    Limiting the information an information system can process, store, or transmit or the manner
     in which an organizational mission or business function is automated;
•    Prohibiting external access to organizational information by removing selected information
     system components from the network (i.e., air gapping); and
•    Prohibiting public access to moderate-impact or high-impact information systems, unless an
     explicit determination is made authorizing such access.

Organizations document the decisions taken during the security control selection process,
providing a sound rationale for those decisions. This documentation is essential when examining
the security considerations for information systems with respect to potential mission/business
impact. The resulting set of security controls along with the supporting rationale for selection
decisions and any information system use restrictions are documented in the security plan for the
information system. Documenting in the security plan any significant risk management decisions

64
  While this example focuses on threats to information systems from purposeful attacks, the scope of concern to most
organizations also includes environmental disruptions and human errors.
65
   NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments. Future updates to Special
Publication 800-30 will include additional information on threat taxonomies and security capabilities.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                     PAGE 24

in the security control selection process is imperative in order for authorizing officials to have the
necessary information to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding the authorization of
organizational information systems. In addition, without such information, the understanding,
assumptions, and rationale supporting those important risk decisions will, in all likelihood, not be
available when the state of the information systems or environments of operation change, and the
original risk decisions are revisited.

Figure 3-2 summarizes the security control selection process,66 including tailoring of the initial
security control baseline and any additional modifications to the baseline required based on an
organizational assessment of risk.67

66
   Some of the steps in the Risk Management Framework are represented by actual security controls (e.g., RA-2,
Security Categorization, CA-2, Security Assessment, CA-6, Security Authorization, and CA-7, Continuous Monitoring)
in Appendix F. A few other selected security controls must be implemented initially to complete the first two steps in
the Risk Management Framework. For example, RA-3, Risk Assessment, is implemented to conduct an organizational
assessment of risk to support selecting, tailoring, and supplementing the security control baseline. Security control PL-
2, Security Plan, is implemented to document the agreed-upon security controls upon completion of the control
selection process. Organizations select and implement security controls in the appropriate sequence to fully execute the
steps in the Risk Management Framework.
67
  An information system can employ security controls at different layers within the system. An operating system, for
example, typically provides an access control capability that includes the identification and authentication of users. An
application, hosted by that operating system, may also provide its own access control capability requiring users to go
through a second level of identification and authentication, thus rendering an additional level of protection for the
information system. Organizations carrying out the security control selection process consider components at all layers
within the information system as part of effective organizational security architecture implementing a defense-in-depth
security strategy.

                                                 Implementation Tip
    Many organizations own and operate large and complex information systems, sometimes referred to as
    a system-of-systems. System architecture plays a key part in the security control selection process for
    these types of information systems. Organizations can address a large and complex system by dividing
    the system into two or more subsystems and applying the FIPS 199 security categorization and FIPS
    200 impact level determination to each subsystem. Applying separate impact levels to each subsystem
    does not change the overall impact level of the information system; rather, it allows the constituent
    subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls instead of deploying higher impact
    controls across every subsystem. It is not valid to treat the subsystems as entirely independent entities,
    however, since the subsystems are interdependent and interconnected. The organization develops a
    security architecture to allocate security controls among the subsystems including monitoring and
    controlling communications at key internal boundaries within the large and complex system (or system-
    of-systems) and provides system-wide controls that meet or exceed the highest information system
    impact level of the constituent subsystems inheriting the security capability from those system-wide
    controls.
    The organization considers that replicated subsystems within a large and complex information system
    may exhibit common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a common threat source; thereby negating
    the redundancy that might be relied upon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security
    incident against one constituent subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same
    time. Risk levels can be adjusted upward or downward based on the actual deployment of security
    controls, the effectiveness of the controls, the environment in which the information system is operating,
    and how the organization is using its information technology.




New Development and Legacy Systems
The security control selection process described in this section can be applied to organizational
information systems from two different perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy. For a
new development system, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the information system does not yet exist and the organization is
conducting an initial security categorization. The security controls included in the security plan
for the information system serve as a security specification for the organization and are expected
to be incorporated into the system during the development and implementation phases of the
system development life cycle. In contrast, for a legacy information system, the security control
selection process is applied from a gap analysis perspective when the organization is anticipating
significant changes to the system (e.g., during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing).
Since the information system already exists, the organization in all likelihood has completed the
security categorization and security control selection processes resulting in the documentation of
a previously agreed-upon set of security controls in the security plan and the implementation of
those controls within the information system. Therefore, the gap analysis can be applied in the
following manner:
•     First, reconfirm or update as necessary, the FIPS 199 security category and FIPS 200 impact
      level for the information system based on the different types of information that are currently
      being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system.
•     Second, review the existing security plan that describes the security controls that are currently
      employed considering any updates to the security category and information system impact
      level as well as any changes to the organization, the system, or the operational environment.
      Reassess the risk and revise the security plan as necessary, including documenting any
      additional security controls that would be needed by the system to ensure that the risk to
      organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
      Nation, remains at an acceptable level.




CHAPTER 3                                                                                                  PAGE 26
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Third, implement the security controls described in the updated security plan, document in the
     plan of action and milestones any controls not implemented, and continue with the remaining
     steps in the Risk Management Framework in the same manner as a new development system.

Applying Gap Analyses to External Service Providers
The gap analysis perspective is also applied when interacting with external service providers. As
described in Section 2.4, organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on external providers for
critical information system services. Using the steps in the gap analysis described above, the
organization can effectively use the acquisition process and appropriate contractual vehicles to
require external providers to carry out, in collaboration with the organization, the security
categorization and security control selection steps in the RMF. The resulting information can
help determine what security controls the external provider either has in place or intends to
implement for the information system services that are to be provided to the organization. If a
security control deficit exists, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks
arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official.
In such situations, the organization can reduce the organizational risk to an acceptable level by:
•   Using the existing contractual vehicle to require the external provider to meet the additional
    security control requirements established by the organization;
•   Negotiating with the provider for additional security controls (including compensating
    controls) if the existing contractual vehicle does not provide for such added requirements; or
•   Employing alternative risk mitigation measures68 within the organizational information
    system when a contract either does not exist or the contract does not provide the necessary
    leverage for the organization to obtain needed security controls.

3.4 MONITORING SECURITY CONTROLS
After the security controls are implemented and assessed for effectiveness, the information
system is authorized for operation in accordance with the organization’s risk management
strategy (RMF Steps 3, 4, and 5). The organization subsequently initiates specific follow-on actions
as part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring program. The continuous monitoring program
includes an ongoing assessment of security control effectiveness to determine if there is a need to
modify or update the current deployed set of security controls based on changes in the
information system or its environment of operation (RMF Step 6). In particular, the organization
revisits on a regular basis, the risk management activities described in the Risk Management
Framework. In addition to the ongoing activities associated with the implementation of the Risk
Management Framework, there are certain events which can trigger the immediate need to assess
the security state of the information system and if required, modify or update the current security
controls. These events include, for example:
•    An incident results in a breach to the information system, producing a loss of confidence by
     the organization in the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information processed,
     stored, or transmitted by the system;
•    A newly identified, credible, information system-related threat to organizational operations
     and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is identified based on intelligence
     information, law enforcement information, or other credible sources of information;

68
   For example, local policies, procedures, and/or compensating controls could be established on the organization side
to serve as alternative mitigation measures for risks identified in a gap analysis.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 27
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Significant changes to the configuration of the information system through the removal or
     addition of new or upgraded hardware, software, or firmware or changes in the operational
     environment69 potentially degrade the security state of the system; or
•    Significant changes to the organizational risk management strategy, information security
     policy, supported missions and/or business functions, or information being processed, stored,
     or transmitted by the information system.

When such events occur, organizations, at a minimum, take the following actions:70
•    Reconfirm the security category and impact level of the information system.
     The organization reexamines the FIPS 199 security category and FIPS 200 impact level of the
     information system to confirm that the security category and system impact level previously
     established and approved by the authorizing official are still valid. The resulting analysis
     may provide new insights as to the overall importance of the information system in allowing
     the organization to fulfill its mission/business responsibilities.
•    Assess the current security state of the information system and the risk to organizational
     operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
     The organization investigates the information system vulnerability (or vulnerabilities)
     exploited by the threat source (or potentially exploitable by a threat source) and the security
     controls currently implemented within the system as described in the security plan. The
     exploitation of information system vulnerabilities by a threat source may be traced to one or
     more factors including but not limited to: (i) the failure of currently implemented security
     controls; (ii) missing security controls; (iii) insufficient strength of security controls; and/or
     (iv) an increase in the capability of the threat source. Using the results from the assessment
     of the current security state, the organization reassesses the risks arising from use of the
     information system.
•    Plan for and initiate any necessary corrective actions.
     Based on the results of an updated risk assessment, the organization determines what
     additional security controls and/or control enhancements or corrective actions for existing
     controls are necessary to adequately mitigate risk. The security plan for the information
     system is updated to reflect any initial changes to the original plan. A plan of action and
     milestones is developed for any noted weaknesses or deficiencies that are not immediately
     corrected and for the implementation of any security control upgrades or additional controls.
     After the security controls and/or control upgrades have been implemented and any other
     weaknesses or deficiencies corrected, the controls are assessed for effectiveness to determine
     if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
     outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system. If
     necessary, the security plan is updated to reflect any additional corrective actions taken by the
     organization to mitigate risk.




69
  Examples of significant changes in the operational environment are interconnection of external information systems
and large increases or decreases in the size of the community of users accessing the information system.
70
  Organizations determine the specific types of events that would trigger changes to the security controls within the
information system or its environment of operation and a resulting modification to the security plan. The decision to
commit resources in light of such events is guided by an organizational assessment of risk.

•   Consider reauthorizing the information system.
    Depending on the severity of the event, the adverse impact on organizational operations and
    assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and the extent of the corrective
    actions required to fix the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the information system, the
    organization may need to consider reauthorizing the information system in accordance with
    the provisions of NIST Special Publication 800-37. The authorizing official makes the final
    determination on the need to reauthorize the information system in consultation with the risk
    executive (function), system and mission/business owners, the senior information security
    officer, and the chief information officer. The authorizing official may choose to conduct a
    limited reauthorization focusing only on the affected components of the information system
    and the associated security controls and/or control enhancements which have been changed
    during the update. Authorizing officials have sufficient information available from security
    control assessments to initiate, with an appropriate degree of confidence, necessary corrective
    actions.

APPENDIX D

SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES – SUMMARY
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T      his appendix contains the security control baselines that represent the starting point in
       determining the security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact
       information systems.71 The three security control baselines are hierarchical in nature with
regard to the security controls employed in those baselines.72 If a security control is selected for
one of the baselines, the security control family identifier and control number are listed in the
appropriate column. If a control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked “not
selected.” Control enhancements, when used to supplement security controls, are indicated by the
number of the control enhancement. For example, an “IR-2 (1)” in the high baseline entry for the
IR-2 security control indicates that the second control from the Incident Response family has
been selected along with control enhancement (1). Note that some security controls and
enhancements in the security control catalog are not used in any of the baselines in this appendix
but are available for use by organizations if needed; for example, when the results of a risk
assessment indicate the need for additional controls or control enhancements in order to
adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.

Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each security
control in the baselines to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e.,
a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2]
control; a Priority Code 2 (P2) control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority
Code 3 [P3] control). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps ensure that foundational
security controls upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling
organizations to deploy controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with
available resources. The implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not
imply the achievement of any defined level of risk mitigation until all of the security controls in
the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes are used only for implementation
sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions. Table D-1 summarizes sequence
priority codes for the baseline security controls in Table D-2.
                             TABLE D-1: SECURITY CONTROL PRIORITIZATION CODES

         Priority Code             Sequencing                                          Action

 Priority Code 1 (P1)                 FIRST         Implement P1 security controls first.
 Priority Code 2 (P2)                  NEXT         Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls.
 Priority Code 3 (P3)                  LAST         Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls.
 Unspecified Priority Code (P0)       NONE          Security control not selected for baseline.


71
  A complete description of all security controls is provided in Appendices F and G. In addition, separate documents
for individual security control baselines (listed as Annexes 1, 2, and 3) are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.
72
   The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a
particular impact level (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing and Exercises—Moderate: CP-4 (1)) meets a stronger set
of security requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., CP-4 Contingency
Plan Testing and Exercises—Low: CP-4).

MINIMUM ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T
       he minimum assurance requirements for security controls described in the security control
       catalog are listed below. The assurance requirements are directed at the activities and
       actions that security control developers and implementers73 define and apply to increase
the level of confidence that the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
information system. The assurance requirements are applied on a control-by-control basis. The
requirements are grouped by information system impact level (i.e., low, moderate, and high) since
the requirements apply to each control within the respective impact level. Using a format similar
to security controls, assurance requirements are followed by supplemental guidance that provides
additional detail and explanation of how the requirements are to be applied. Bolded text indicates
requirements that appear for the first time at a particular impact level.

Low-Impact Information Systems
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in low-impact information systems, the focus is on the controls
being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are discovered, they are
addressed in a timely manner.

Moderate-Impact Information Systems
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the control.
The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned
responsibilities and specific actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is
implemented, it will meet its required function or purpose. These actions include, for example,
requiring the development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this
determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in moderate-impact information systems, the focus is on
actions supporting increased confidence in the correct implementation and operation of the control. While
flaws are still likely to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer/implementer
incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities and produces specific documentation supporting
increased confidence that the control meets its required function or purpose. This documentation is also
needed by assessors to analyze and test the functional properties of the control as part of the overall
assessment of the control.

Note: This level of assurance is not intended to protect a moderate-impact information system against high-
end threat agents (i.e., threat agents that are highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-resourced). When
such protection is required, the section below entitled Additional Assurance Requirements for Moderate-
Impact and High-Impact Information Systems applies.



73
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls. This may include in addition to organizational personnel, for example, hardware
and software vendors providing the controls and contractors implementing the controls.



APPENDIX E                                                                                                     PAGE E-1
Special Publication 800-53       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

High-Impact Information Systems
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis
and testing of the control (including functional interfaces among control components). The control
developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned responsibilities and specific
actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and
consistently (i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support
improvement in the effectiveness of the control. These actions include, for example, requiring the
development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in high-impact information systems, the focus is expanded to
require, within the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the
control and continuous improvement in the control’s effectiveness. The developer/implementer is expected
to expend significant effort on the design, development, implementation, and component/integration testing
of the controls and to produce associated design and implementation documentation to support these
activities. This documentation is also needed by assessors to analyze and test the internal components of
the control as part of the overall assessment of the control.

Note: This level of assurance is not intended to protect a high-impact information system against high-end
threat agents (i.e., threat agents that are highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-resourced). When such
protection is required, the section below entitled Additional Assurance Requirements for Moderate-Impact
and High-Impact Information Systems applies.

Additional Assurance Requirements for Moderate-Impact and High-Impact Information Systems
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
testing of the control. The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, actions
supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently
(i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the
effectiveness of the control. These actions include requiring the development of records with structure and
content suitable to facilitate making this determination. The control is developed in a manner that
supports a high degree of confidence that the control is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: The additional high assurance requirements are intended to supplement the
minimum assurance requirements for moderate-impact and high-impact information systems, when
appropriate, in order to protect against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-resourced
threat agents. This level of protection is necessary for those information systems where the organization is
not willing to accept the risks associated with the type of threat agents cited above.

APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE




T
       he catalog of security controls in this appendix provides a range of safeguards and
       countermeasures for organizations and information systems. The organization of the
       security control catalog, the structure of the controls, and the concept of allocating security
controls and control enhancements to the initial baselines in Appendix D are described in Chapter
Two. The security controls in the catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are
withdrawn, revised and added. In order to maintain stability in security plans and automated
tools supporting the implementation of NIST Special Publication 800-53, security controls and
control enhancements will not be renumbered each time a control or enhancement is withdrawn.
Notations of security controls and controls enhancements that have been withdrawn will be
maintained in the catalog for historical purposes.




APPENDIX F                                                                                           PAGE F-1

________________________________________________________________________________________________

                                            About the Catalog
  Security controls and control enhancements in Appendices F and G are generally designed to be policy-
  neutral and technology/implementation independent. Additional information about security controls and
  control enhancements can be provided in two ways:
  • By establishing specific values in the variable sections of selected security controls (i.e., assignment
    and selection statements); and
  • By specifying security control implementation detail (e.g., platform dependencies) in the associated
    security plan for the information system or security program plan for the organization.

  Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to specialize security
  controls and control enhancements based on organizational security requirements and/or requirements
  originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines.
  Security control enhancements are used to strengthen or broaden the fundamental security capability
  described in the base control and are not used as a substitute for using assignment or selection
  statements to add greater specificity to the control. The first security control in each family (a.k.a. the
  dash one control) generates the requirement for policy and procedures that are needed for the effective
  implementation of the other security controls and control enhancements in the family. Therefore, the
  individual controls/enhancements in the family typically do not call for the development of such policy
  and procedures.

  Security controls and control enhancements are employed in federal information systems in accordance
  with the risk management guidance provided in NIST Special Publication 800-39 as summarized in
  Chapter Three of this publication. This guidance includes selecting baseline security controls (see
  Appendix D) in accordance with the FIPS 199 security category of the information system and the FIPS
  200 system impact level, and subsequently tailoring the baseline. The tailored security control baseline
  represents the minimum controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems,
  respectively. There are additional security controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog
  that are not used in any of the baselines. These additional controls and control enhancements are
  available to organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to achieve the
  needed level of protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. Moreover, security
  controls and control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be used in lower-level
  baselines, if deemed appropriate, to provide additional protection measures.

  Beginning with NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 3, the supplemental guidance sections for
  security controls and control enhancements contain no requirements or references to FIPS or NIST
  Special Publications. NIST publications are included in a new References section that has been added
  to the general description and content of the security control specification. In addition, minimum and
  maximum values (e.g., testing contingency plans at least annually) have been removed from the
  assignment statements in security controls. Organizations should consult specific federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines as the definitive sources for
  such information. Removal of minimum and maximum values from the security controls does not
  obviate the need of organizations to comply with requirements in the controlling source publications.

  Finally, in support of the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative to develop a unified information
  security framework for the federal government, security controls for national security systems are
  included in the security control catalog. The inclusion of these security controls is not intended to
  impose security requirements on organizations that operate national security systems; rather, the
  controls are available to use on a voluntary basis with the approval of appropriate federal officials
  exercising policy authority over such systems. In addition, the security control priorities and security
  control baselines listed in Appendix D and in the priority and baseline allocation summary boxes below
  each security control in Appendix F, apply to nonnational security systems only unless otherwise
  directed by the aforementioned federal officials with national security policy authority.

FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL                                                                       CLASS: TECHNICAL


AC-1     ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.        A formal, documented access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                   responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                   compliance; and
         b.        Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy
                   and associated access controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the access control family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal
         laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The access control policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Access control procedures can be developed for
         the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The
         organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the access control
         policy. Related control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

AC-2     ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including:

         a.        Identifying account types (i.e., individual, group, system, application, guest/anonymous, and
                   temporary);
         b.        Establishing conditions for group membership;
         c.        Identifying authorized users of the information system and specifying access privileges;
         d.        Requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish accounts;
         e.        Establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing accounts;
         f.        Specifically authorizing and monitoring the use of guest/anonymous and temporary accounts;
         g.        Notifying account managers when temporary accounts are no longer required and when
                   information system users are terminated, transferred, or information system usage or need-to-
                   know/need-to-share changes;
         h.        Deactivating: (i) temporary accounts that are no longer required; and (ii) accounts of
                   terminated or transferred users;
         i.        Granting access to the system based on: (i) a valid access authorization; (ii) intended system
                   usage; and (iii) other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business

         Supplemental Guidance: The identification of authorized users of the information system and the
         specification of access privileges is consistent with the requirements in other security controls in
         the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts
         receive additional scrutiny by organizational officials responsible for approving such accounts and
         privileged access. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-10, AC-17, AC-19, AC-20,
         AU-9, IA-4, IA-5, CM-5, CM-6, MA-3, MA-4, MA-5, SA-7, SC-13, SI-9.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
                system accounts.
         (2)    The information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts after
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
         (3)    The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organization-
                defined time period].
         (4)    The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, disabling, and
                termination actions and notifies, as required, appropriate individuals.
         (5)    The organization:
                (a)    Requires that users log out when [Assignment: organization defined time-period of expected
                       inactivity and/or description of when to log out];
                (b) Determines normal time-of-day and duration usage for information system accounts;
                (c)    Monitors for atypical usage of information system accounts; and
                (d) Reports atypical usage to designated organizational officials.
         (6)    The information system dynamically manages user privileges and associated access
                authorizations.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional access control approaches
                which employ static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, many
                service-oriented architecture implementations rely on run time access control decisions
                facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities remain relatively constant
                over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on the ongoing mission/business
                requirements and operational needs of the organization.
         (7)    The organization:
                (a)    Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
                       scheme that organizes information system and network privileges into roles; and
                (b) Tracks and monitors privileged role assignments.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Privileged roles include, for example, key management,
                network and system administration, database administration, web administration.

AC-3     ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

         Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to the system
         in accordance with applicable policy.
         Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
         attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access
         control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or
         processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs,
         domains) in the information system. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information-


APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                                PAGE F-4

________________________________________________________________________________________________


         system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
         necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given
         to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of
         emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access
         enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. For
         classified information, the cryptography used is largely dependent on the classification level of the
         information and the clearances of the individuals having access to the information. Mechanisms
         implemented by AC-3 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security
         controls. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,
         AC-21, AC-22, AU-9, CM-5, CM-6, MA-3, MA-4, MA-5, SA-7, SC-13, SI-9.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    [Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].
         (2)    The information system enforces dual authorization, based on organizational policies and
                procedures for [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Dual authorization mechanisms require two forms of
                approval to execute. The organization does not employ dual authorization mechanisms when
                an immediate response is necessary to ensure public and environmental safety.
         (3)    The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined nondiscretionary access
                control policies] over [Assignment: organization-defined set of users and resources] where the
                policy rule set for each policy specifies:
                (a)   Access control information (i.e., attributes) employed by the policy rule set (e.g., position,
                      nationality, age, project, time of day); and
                (b) Required relationships among the access control information to permit access.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Nondiscretionary access control policies that may be
                implemented by organizations include, for example, Attribute-Based Access Control,
                Mandatory Access Control, and Originator Controlled Access Control. Nondiscretionary
                access control policies may be employed by organizations in addition to the employment of
                discretionary access control policies.
                For Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Policy establishes coverage over all subjects and
                objects under its control to ensure that each user receives only that information to which the
                user is authorized access based on classification of the information, and on user clearance and
                formal access authorization. The information system assigns appropriate security attributes
                (e.g., labels/security domains/types) to subjects and objects, and uses these attributes as the
                basis for MAC decisions. The Bell-LaPadula security model defines allowed access with
                regard to an organization-defined set of strictly hierarchical security levels as follows: A
                subject can read an object only if the security level of the subject dominates the security level
                of the object and a subject can write to an object only if two conditions are met: the security
                level of the object dominates the security level of the subject, and the security level of the
                user’s clearance dominates the security level of the object (no read up, no write down).
                For Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Policy establishes coverage over all users and
                resources to ensure that access rights are grouped by role name, and access to resources is
                restricted to users who have been authorized to assume the associated role.
         (4)    The information system enforces a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy that:
                (a)   Allows users to specify and control sharing by named individuals or groups of individuals, or
                      by both;
                (b) Limits propagation of access rights; and
                (c)   Includes or excludes access to the granularity of a single user.
         (5)    The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant
                information] except during secure, nonoperable system states.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant information is any information within
                the information system that can potentially impact the operation of security functions in a



APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                                   PAGE F-5
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation
                of code and data. Filtering rules for routers and firewalls, cryptographic key management
                information, key configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists are
                examples of security-relevant information. Secure, nonoperable system states are states in
                which the information system is not performing mission/business-related processing (e.g., the
                system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shutdown).
         (6)    The organization encrypts or stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment: organization-defined
                user and/or system information].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The use of encryption by the organization reduces the
                probability of unauthorized disclosure of information and can also detect unauthorized
                changes to information. Removing information from online storage to offline storage
                eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access via a network. Related
                control: MP-4.

AC-4     INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

         Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of
         information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable
         policy.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
         within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
         access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A
         few examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information from
         being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within
         the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal
         web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly
         employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and
         destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between
         interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the
         information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary
         protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that
         employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
         provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability
         based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics). Mechanisms
         implemented by AC-4 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security
         controls. Related controls: AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2, SC-5, SC-7, SC-18.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system enforces information flow control using explicit security attributes on
                information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare
                security attributes on all information (data content and data structure), source and destination
                objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the
                mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by the information flow
                policy. Information flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for
                example, to control the release of certain types of information.
         (2)    The information system enforces information flow control using protected processing domains
                (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decisions.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

         (3)    The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on policy that allows or
                disallows information flows based on changing conditions or operational considerations.
         (4)    The information system prevents encrypted data from bypassing content-checking mechanisms.
         (5)    The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations on the embedding
                of data types within other data types].
         (6)    The information system enforces information flow control on metadata.
         (7)    The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way flows] using
                hardware mechanisms.
         (8)    The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined
                security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organization-defined security policy filters include, for
                example, dirty word filters, file type checking filters, structured data filters, unstructured data
                filters, metadata content filters, and hidden content filters. Structured data permits the
                interpretation of its content by virtue of atomic elements that are understandable by an
                application and indivisible. Unstructured data refers to masses of (usually) digital information
                that does not have a data structure or has a data structure that is not easily readable by a
                machine. Unstructured data consists of two basic categories: (i) bitmap objects that are
                inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that
                are based on a written or printed language (i.e., commercial off-the-shelf word processing
                documents, spreadsheets, or emails).
         (9)    The information system enforces the use of human review for [Assignment: organization-defined
                security policy filters] when the system is not capable of making an information flow control
                decision.
         (10) The information system provides the capability for a privileged administrator to enable/disable
              [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters].
         (11) The information system provides the capability for a privileged administrator to configure
              [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: For example, to reflect changes in the security policy, an
                administrator can change the list of “dirty words” that the security policy mechanism checks
                in accordance with the definitions provided by the organization.
         (12) The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
              identifies information flows by data type specification and usage.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Data type specification and usage include, for example,
                using file naming to reflect type of data and limiting data transfer based on file type.
         (13) The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
              decomposes information into policy-relevant subcomponents for submission to policy
              enforcement mechanisms.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Policy enforcement mechanisms include the filtering
                and/or sanitization rules that are applied to information prior to transfer to a different security
                domain. Parsing transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates,
                classification, subject, attachments, and other information security-related component
                differentiators. Policy rules for cross domain transfers include, for example, limitations on
                embedding components/information types within other components/information types,
                prohibiting more than two-levels of embedding, and prohibiting the transfer of archived
                information types.
         (14) The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
              implements policy filters that constrain data structure and content to [Assignment: organization-
              defined information security policy requirements].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Constraining file lengths, allowed enumerations, character
                sets, schemas, and other data object attributes reduces the range of potential malicious and/or
                unsanctioned content. Examples of constraints include ensuring that: (i) character data fields
                only contain printable ASCII; (ii) character data fields only contain alpha-numeric characters;



APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                               PAGE F-7
Special Publication 800-53            Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                (iii) character data fields do not contain special characters; or (iv) maximum field sizes and
                file lengths are enforced based upon organization-defined security policy.
         (15) The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, detects
              unsanctioned information and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the
              security policy.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Actions to support this enhancement include: checking
                all transferred information for malware, implementing dirty word list searches on transferred
                information, and applying the same protection measures to metadata (e.g., security attributes)
                that is applied to the information payload.
         (16) The information system enforces security policies regarding information on interconnected
              systems.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Transferring information between interconnected
                information systems of differing security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate
                one or more policies. While security policy violations may not be absolutely prohibited,
                policy guidance from information owners/stewards is implemented at the policy enforcement
                point between the interconnected systems. Specific architectural solutions are mandated,
                when required, to reduce the potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities. Architectural
                solutions include, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected
                systems (i.e. implementing access only, one way transfer mechanisms); (ii) employing
                hardware mechanisms to enforce unitary information flow directions; and (iii) implementing
                fully tested, re-grading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and associated security
                labels.
         (17) The information system:
                (a)    Uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination domains for information
                       transfer;
                (b) Binds security attributes to information to facilitate information flow policy enforcement; and
                (c)    Tracks problems associated with the security attribute binding and information transfer.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Attribution is a critical component of a security concept
                of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in
                an information system, allows forensic reconstruction of events when required, and increases
                policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals.
                Means to enforce this enhancement include ensuring that the information system resolution
                labels distinguish between information systems and organizations, and between specific
                system components or individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating
                information.

         information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different
         individuals perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems

AC-6     LEAST PRIVILEGE

         Control: The organization employs the concept of least privilege, allowing only authorized
         accesses for users (and processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish
         assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
         Supplemental Guidance: The access authorizations defined in this control are largely implemented
         by control AC-3. The organization employs the concept of least privilege for specific duties and
         information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk
         assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets,
         individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, CM-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined list of security
                functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Establishing system accounts, configuring access
                authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion
                detection parameters are examples of security functions. Explicitly authorized personnel
                include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, system
                security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged
                users. Related control: AC-17.
         (2)    The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to
                [Assignment: organization-defined list of security functions or security-relevant information], use
                non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other system functions, and if feasible, audits
                any use of privileged accounts, or roles, for such functions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is intended to limit exposure
                due to operating from within a privileged account or role. The inclusion of role is intended to
                address those situations where an access control policy such as Role Based Access Control
                (RBAC) is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of
                assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on
                behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged
                account. Audit of privileged activity may require physical separation employing information
                systems on which the user does not have privileged access.
         (3)    The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged
                commands] only for compelling operational needs and documents the rationale for such access in
                the security plan for the information system.
         (4)    The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation
                of user privileges.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Employing virtualization techniques to allow greater
                privilege within a virtual machine while restricting privilege to the underlying actual machine
                is an example of providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user
                privileges.
         (5)    The organization limits authorization to super user accounts on the information system to
                designated system administration personnel.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Super user accounts are typically described as “root” or
                “administrator” for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Configuring
                organizational information systems (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, servers, workstations)
                such that day-to-day users are not authorized access to super user accounts is an example of
                limiting system authorization. The organization may differentiate in the application of this
                control enhancement between allowed privileges for local information system accounts and
                for domain accounts provided the organization retains the ability to control the configuration
                of the system with regard to key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to
                sufficiently mitigate risk.
         (6)    The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational
                users.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: A qualified organizational user may be advised by a non-
                organizational user, if necessary.

AC-7     UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

         Control: The information system:

         a.     Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid login
                attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
         b.     Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined
                time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next login
                prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the
                maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. The control applies regardless of
                whether the login occurs via a local or network connection.
         Supplemental Guidance: Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
         the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
         period established by the organization. If a delay algorithm is selected, the organization may
         chose to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the
         capabilities of those components. Response to unsuccessful login attempts may be implemented
         at both the operating system and the application levels. This control applies to all accesses other
         than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator
                when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
         (2)    The information system provides additional protection for mobile devices accessed via login by
                purging information from the device after [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive,
                unsuccessful login attempts to the device.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This enhancement applies only to mobile devices for
                which a login occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants) and not to mobile devices accessed
                without a login such as removable media. In certain situations, this enhancement may not

                apply to mobile devices if the information on the device is encrypted with sufficiently strong
                encryption mechanisms, making purging unnecessary. The login is to the mobile device, not
                to any one account on the device. Therefore, a successful login to any account on the mobile
                device resets the unsuccessful login count to zero.

AC-8     SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

         Control: The information system:

         a.     Displays an approved system use notification message or banner before granting access to the
                system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws,
                Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states that: (i)
                users are accessing a U.S. Government information system; (ii) system usage may be
                monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; (iii) unauthorized use of the system is prohibited
                and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and (iv) use of the system indicates consent to
                monitoring and recording;
         b.     Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users take explicit actions to log
                on to or further access the information system; and
         c.     For publicly accessible systems: (i) displays the system use information when appropriate,
                before granting further access; (ii) displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or
                auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally
                prohibit those activities; and (iii) includes in the notice given to public users of the
                information system, a description of the authorized uses of the system.
         Supplemental Guidance: System use notification messages can be implemented in the form of
         warning banners displayed when individuals log in to the information system. System use
         notification is intended only for information system access that includes an interactive login
         interface with a human user and is not intended to require notification when an interactive
         interface does not exist.

AC-9     PREVIOUS LOGON (ACCESS) NOTIFICATION

         Control: The information system notifies the user, upon successful logon (access), of the date and
         time of the last logon (access).
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to cover both traditional logons to information
         systems and general accesses to information systems that occur in other types of architectural

         to [Assignment: organization-defined number].
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions
         for an information system account globally, by account type, by account, or a combination. This
         control addresses concurrent sessions for a given information system account and does not address
         concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts.

AC-11    SESSION LOCK

         Control: The information system:

         a.     Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after [Assignment:
                organization-defined time period] of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and
         b.     Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and
                authentication procedures.
         Supplemental Guidance: A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
         moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to
         log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. The session lock is implemented at the
         point where session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but
         may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the
         information system, for example, if the organization requires users to log out at the end of the
         workday.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system session lock mechanism, when activated on a device with a display
                screen, places a publicly viewable pattern onto the associated display, hiding what was previously
                visible on the screen.

         [Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2 and AU-6].



AC-14    PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Identifies specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without
                identification or authentication; and
         b.     Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system,
                user actions not requiring identification and authentication.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended for those specific instances where an organization
         determines that no identification and authentication is required; it is not, however, mandating that
         such instances exist in given information system. The organization may allow a limited number of
         user actions without identification and authentication (e.g., when individuals access public
         websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems such as http://www.usa.gov).
         Organizations also identify any actions that normally require identification or authentication but
         may under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication
         mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypass may be, for example, via a software-readable physical
         switch that commands bypass of the login functionality and is protected from accidental or
         unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication
         have already occurred and are not being repeated, but rather to situations where identification
         and/or authentication have not yet occurred. Related control: CP-2, IA-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization permits actions to be performed without identification and authentication only to
                the extent necessary to accomplish mission/business objectives.

AC-16    SECURITY ATTRIBUTES

         Control: The information system supports and maintains the binding of [Assignment: organization-
         defined security attributes] to information in storage, in process, and in transmission.
         Supplemental Guidance: Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or
         characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.
         These attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files)
         within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and
         flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or
         support other aspects of the information security policy. The term security label is often used to
         associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure




APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                             PAGE F-13

         for that object (e.g., user access privileges, nationality, affiliation as contractor). Related controls:
         AC-3, AC-4, SC-16, MP-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system dynamically reconfigures security attributes in accordance with an
                identified security policy as information is created and combined.
         (2)    The information system allows authorized entities to change security attributes.
         (3)    The information system maintains the binding of security attributes to information with sufficient
                assurance that the information--attribute association can be used as the basis for automated policy
                actions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of automated policy actions include automated
                access control decisions (e.g., Mandatory Access Control decisions), or decisions to release
                (or not release) information (e.g., information flows via cross domain systems).
         (4)    The information system allows authorized users to associate security attributes with information.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The support provided by the information system can vary
                from prompting users to select security attributes to be associated with specific information
                objects, to ensuring that the combination of attributes selected is valid.
         (5)    The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object output
                from the system to system output devices to identify [Assignment: organization-identified set of
                special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-
                identified human readable, standard naming conventions].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Objects output from the information system include, for
                example, pages, screens, or equivalent. Output devices include, for example, printers and
                video displays on computer terminals, monitors, screens on notebook/laptop computers and
                personal digital assistants.

AC-17    REMOTE ACCESS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Documents allowed methods of remote access to the information system;
         b.     Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for each allowed remote access
                method;
         c.     Monitors for unauthorized remote access to the information system;
         d.     Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to connection; and
         e.     Enforces requirements for remote connections to the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control requires explicit authorization prior to allowing remote access
         to an information system without specifying a specific format for that authorization. For example,
         while the organization may deem it appropriate to use a system interconnection agreement to
         authorize a given remote access, such agreements are not required by this control. Remote access
         is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a
         user) communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access
         methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless (see AC-18 for wireless access). A virtual
         private network when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, is considered an
         internal network (i.e., the organization establishes a network connection between organization-
         controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on external



APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                             PAGE F-14

         networks to protect the confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network).
         Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or
         systems specifically designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions associated with
         remote connections is accomplished by control AC-3. Related controls: AC-3, AC-18, AC-20,
         IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of
                remote access methods.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows
                organizations to audit user activities on a variety of information system components (e.g.,
                servers, workstations, notebook/laptop computers) and to ensure compliance with remote
                access policy.
         (2)    The organization uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access
                sessions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based
                on the security categorization of the information. Related controls: SC-8, SC-9, SC-13.
         (3)    The information system routes all remote accesses through a limited number of managed access
                control points.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-7.
         (4)    The organization authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant
                information via remote access only for compelling operational needs and documents the rationale
                for such access in the security plan for the information system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
         (5)    The organization monitors for unauthorized remote connections to the information system
                [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and takes appropriate action if an unauthorized
                connection is discovered.
         (6)    The organization ensures that users protect information about remote access mechanisms from
                unauthorized use and disclosure.
         (7)    The organization ensures that remote sessions for accessing [Assignment: organization-defined
                list of security functions and security-relevant information] employ [Assignment: organization-
                defined additional security measures] and are audited.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Additional security measures are typically above and
                beyond standard bulk or session layer encryption (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], Virtual Private
                Networking [VPN] with blocking mode enabled). Related controls: SC-8, SC-9.
         (8)    The organization disables [Assignment: organization-defined networking protocols within the
                information system deemed to be nonsecure] except for explicitly identified components in
                support of specific operational requirements.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization can either make a determination of the
                relative security of the networking protocol or base the security decision on the assessment of
                other entities. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure
                networking protocols.

AC-18    WIRELESS ACCESS

         Control: The organization:

         a. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for wireless access;
         b. Monitors for unauthorized wireless access to the information system;
         c. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to connection; and
         d. Enforces requirements for wireless connections to the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Wireless technologies include, but are not limited to, microwave, satellite,
         packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication
         protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
         In certain situations, wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines and control of organization-
         controlled facilities. Related controls: AC-3, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system protects wireless access to the system using authentication and
                encryption.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Authentication applies to user, device, or both as
                necessary. Related control: SC-13.
         (2)    The organization monitors for unauthorized wireless connections to the information system,
                including scanning for unauthorized wireless access points [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency], and takes appropriate action if an unauthorized connection is discovered.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations proactively search for unauthorized
                wireless connections including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access
                points. The scan is not necessarily limited to only those areas within the facility containing
                the information systems, yet is conducted outside of those areas only as needed to verify that
                unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to the system.
         (3)    The organization disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities internally
                embedded within information system components prior to issuance and deployment.
         (4)    The organization does not allow users to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.
         (5)    The organization confines wireless communications to organization-controlled boundaries.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Actions that may be taken by the organization to confine
                wireless communications to organization-controlled boundaries include: (i) reducing the
                power of the wireless transmission such that it cannot transit the physical perimeter of the
                organization; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; and
                (iii) configuring the wireless access such that it is point to point in nature.

AC-19    ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for organization-controlled
                mobile devices;
         b.     Authorizes connection of mobile devices meeting organizational usage restrictions and
                implementation guidance to organizational information systems;




APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                              PAGE F-16

________________________________________________________________________________________________


         c.     Monitors for unauthorized connections of mobile devices to organizational information
                systems;
         d.     Enforces requirements for the connection of mobile devices to organizational information
                systems;
         e.     Disables information system functionality that provides the capability for automatic execution
                of code on mobile devices without user direction;
         f.     Issues specially configured mobile devices to individuals traveling to locations that the
                organization deems to be of significant risk in accordance with organizational policies and
                procedures; and
         g.     Applies [Assignment: organization-defined inspection and preventative measures] to mobile
                devices returning from locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk in
                accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
         Supplemental Guidance: Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks,
         external hard disk drives) and portable computing and communications devices with information
         storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones,
         digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Organization-controlled mobile devices include
         those devices for which the organization has the authority to specify and the ability to enforce
         specific security requirements. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance related to mobile
         devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication,
         implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall),
         scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical
         software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
         software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared).
         Examples of information system functionality that provide the capability for automatic execution
         of code are AutoRun and AutoPlay.
         Organizational policies and procedures for mobile devices used by individuals departing on and
         returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining
         required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before
         travel is initiated, and applying specific measures to the device after travel is completed. Specially
         configured mobile devices include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited
         applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified
         measures applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the
         device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting
         information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media protection family. Related
         controls: MP-4, MP-5.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization restricts the use of writable, removable media in organizational information
                systems.
         (2)    The organization prohibits the use of personally owned, removable media in organizational
                information systems.
         (3)    The organization prohibits the use of removable media in organizational information systems when
                the media has no identifiable owner.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An identifiable owner (e.g., individual, organization, or
                project) for removable media helps to reduce the risk of using such technology by assigning
                responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g.,
                malicious code insertion).
         (4)    The organization:
                (a)   Prohibits the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems
                      processing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted by the
                      appropriate authorizing official(s); and




APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                                PAGE F-17

________________________________________________________________________________________________

                (b) Enforces the following restrictions on individuals permitted to use mobile devices in facilities
                    containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information:
                    -    Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information systems is
                         prohibited;
                    -    Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified information systems requires
                         approval from the appropriate authorizing official(s);
                    -    Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the mobile devices is
                         prohibited; and
                    -    Mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject to random
                         reviews/inspections by [Assignment: organization-defined security officials], and if
                         classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed.

AC-20    USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

         Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships
         established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information
         systems, allowing authorized individuals to:
         a.     Access the information system from the external information systems; and
         b.     Process, store, and/or transmit organization-controlled information using the external
                information systems.
         Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of
         information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by the organization
         and for which the organization typically has no direct supervision and authority over the
         application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness.
         External information systems include, but are not limited to: (i) personally owned information
         systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned
         computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels,
         convention centers, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal
         governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated
         by, or under the direct supervision and authority of the organization. For some external systems,
         in particular those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate
         to those agencies, the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations
         and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required.
         In effect, the information systems of these organizations would not be considered external. These
         situations typically occur when, for example, there is some pre-existing sharing or trust agreement
         (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies and/or organizations subordinate
         to those agencies, or such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
         directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or
         any other individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system and over
         which the organization has the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access.
         The restrictions that an organization imposes on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as
         those restrictions are likely to vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations.
         Thus, an organization might impose more stringent security restrictions on a contractor than on a
         state, local, or tribal government.
         This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces
         to organizational information systems and information (e.g., individuals accessing federal
         information through www.usa.gov). The organization establishes terms and conditions for the use



APPENDIX F-AC                                                                                                 PAGE F-18

________________________________________________________________________________________________


         of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and
         procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of applications that can
         be accessed on the organizational information system from the external information system; and
         (ii) the maximum security categorization of information that can be processed, stored, and
         transmitted on the external information system. This control defines access authorizations
         enforced by AC-3, rules of behavior requirements enforced by PL-4, and session establishment
         rules enforced by AC-17. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, PL-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access
                the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only
                when the organization:
                (a)    Can verify the implementation of required security controls on the external system as
                       specified in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or
                (b) Has approved information system connection or processing agreements with the
                    organizational entity hosting the external information system.
         (2)    The organization limits the use of organization-controlled portable storage media by authorized
                individuals on external information systems.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable
                storage media in external information systems can include, for example, complete prohibition
                of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what
                conditions the devices may be used.

AC-21    USER-BASED COLLABORATION AND INFORMATION SHARING

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access
                authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information
                for [Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user
                discretion is required]; and
         b.     Employs [Assignment: list of organization-defined information sharing circumstances and
                automated mechanisms or manual processes required] to assist users in making information
                sharing/collaboration decisions.
         Supplemental Guidance: The control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner
         (e.g., privileged medical, contract-sensitive, proprietary, personally identifiable information,
         special access programs/compartments) based on some formal or administrative determination.
         Depending on the information-sharing circumstance, the sharing partner may be defined at the
         individual, group, or organization level and information may be defined by specific content, type,
         or security categorization. Related control: AC-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system employs automated mechanisms to enable authorized users to make
                information-sharing decisions based on access authorizations of sharing partners and access
                restrictions on information to be shared.

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Designates individuals authorized to post information onto an organizational information
                system that is publicly accessible;
         b.     Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain
                nonpublic information;
         c.     Reviews the proposed content of publicly accessible information for nonpublic information
                prior to posting onto the organizational information system;
         d.     Reviews the content on the publicly accessible organizational information system for
                nonpublic information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
         e.     Removes nonpublic information from the publicly accessible organizational information
                system, if discovered.
         Supplemental Guidance: Nonpublic information is any information for which the general public is
         not authorized access in accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
         regulations, standards, or guidance. Information protected under the Privacy Act and vendor
         proprietary information are examples of nonpublic information. This control addresses posting
         information on an organizational information system that is accessible to the general public,
         typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization
         information systems is covered by appropriate organizational policy. Related controls: AC-3, AU-

AT-1     SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope,
                roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security awareness and
                training policy and associated security awareness and training controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the security awareness and training family. The policy and procedures are consistent with
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The security awareness and training policy can be
         included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security
         awareness and training procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a
         particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a
         key factor in the development of the security awareness and training policy. Related control: PM-

AT-2     SECURITY AWARENESS

         Control: The organization provides basic security awareness training to all information system
         users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors) as part of initial training for new
         users, when required by system changes, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
         thereafter.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate content of security awareness
         training and security awareness techniques based on the specific requirements of the organization
         and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content includes a
         basic understanding of the need for information security and user actions to maintain security and
         to respond to suspected security incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for
         operations security as it relates to the organization’s information security program. Security
         awareness techniques can include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed
         with security reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials,
         displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security awareness events.
         Control Enhancements:

AU-1     AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the audit and
                accountability policy and associated audit and accountability controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the audit and accountability family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
         federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The audit and accountability policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Audit and accountability procedures can be
         developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when
         required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the
         audit and accountability policy. Related control: PM-9.

AU-2     AUDITABLE EVENTS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Determines, based on a risk assessment and mission/business needs, that the information
                system must be capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined
                list of auditable events];
         b.     Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-
                related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable
                events;
         c.     Provides a rationale for why the list of auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support
                after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
         d.     Determines, based on current threat information and ongoing assessment of risk, that the
                following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-
                defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. to be audited along with the
                frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
         Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which
         need to be auditable as significant and relevant to the security of the information system; giving an
         overall system requirement in order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance auditing
         requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset
         of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in time. For example, the organization
         may determine that the information system must have the capability to log every file access both
         successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due

         this control, includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process
         identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or
         flow control rules invoked. Related controls: AU-2, AU-8.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system includes [Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed
                information] in the audit records for audit events identified by type, location, or subject.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An example of detailed information that the organization
                may require in audit records is full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual
                identities of group account users.
         (2)    The organization centrally manages the content of audit records generated by [Assignment:

         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system integrates audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to support
                organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.
         (2)    [Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].
         (3)    The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain
                organization-wide situational awareness.
         (4)    The information system centralizes the review and analysis of audit records from multiple
                components within the system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An example of an automated mechanism for centralized
                review and analysis is a Security Information Management (SIM) product. Related control:
                AU-2.
         (5)    The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of vulnerability scanning
                information, performance data, and network monitoring information to further enhance the ability
                to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: A Security Event/Information Management system tool
                can facilitate audit record aggregation and consolidation from multiple information system
                components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit
                record analysis scripts developed by the organization (with localized script adjustments, as
                necessary), provides a more cost-effective approach for analyzing audit record information
                collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information
                is important in determining the veracity of the vulnerability scans and correlating attack
                detection events with scanning results. Related control: AU-7, RA-5, SI-4.

         records.
         Supplemental Guidance: Time stamps generated by the information system include both date and
         time. The time may be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation
         of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Related control: AU-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system synchronizes internal information system clocks [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source].

AU-9     PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION

         Control: The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized
         access, modification, and deletion.
         Supplemental Guidance: Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
         settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. Related
         controls: AC-3, AC-6.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system produces audit records on hardware-enforced, write-once media.
         (2)    The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto
                a different system or media than the system being audited.
         (3)    The information system uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit
                information and audit tools.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An example of a cryptographic mechanism for the
                protection of integrity is the computation and application of a cryptographic-signed hash
                using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the
                hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.
         (4)    The organization:
                (a)    Authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only a limited subset of privileged
                       users; and
                (b) Protects the audit records of non-local accesses to privileged accounts and the execution of
                    privileged functions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Auditing may not be reliable when performed by the
                information system to which the user being audited has privileged access. The privileged user
                may inhibit auditing or modify audit records. This control enhancement helps mitigate this
                risk by requiring that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and
                other privileges, thus, limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Reducing the risk of

                audit compromises by privileged users can also be achieved, for example, by performing audit
                activity on a separate information system or by using storage media that cannot be modified
                (e.g., write-once recording devices).

AU-10    NON-REPUDIATION

         Control: The information system protects against an individual falsely denying having performed a
         particular action.
         Supplemental Guidance: Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating
         information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a
         contract), and receiving a message. Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by
         an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a
         message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a
         document. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an
         individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract,
         approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Non-repudiation services are
         obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message
         receipts).
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system associates the identity of the information producer with the information.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement supports audit requirements
                that provide appropriate organizational officials the means to identify who produced specific
                information in the event of an information transfer. The nature and strength of the binding
                between the information producer and the information are determined and approved by the
                appropriate organizational officials based on the security categorization of the information
                and relevant risk factors.
         (2)    The information system validates the binding of the information producer’s identity to the
                information.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is intended to mitigate the risk
                that information is modified between production and review. The validation of bindings can
                be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums.
         (3)    The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established
                chain of custody for all information reviewed or released.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is
                automated but separate from the release/transfer function, the information system associates
                the identity of the reviewer of the information to be released with the information and the
                information label. In the case of human reviews, this control enhancement provides
                appropriate organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released the
                information. In the case of automated reviews, this control enhancement helps ensure that
                only approved review functions are employed.

         (4)    The information system validates the binding of the reviewer’s identity to the information at the
                transfer/release point prior to release/transfer from one security domain to another security
                domain.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is intended to mitigate the risk
                that information is modified between review and transfer/release.

AU-11    AUDIT RECORD RETENTION

         Control: The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period
         consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of
         security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization retains audit records until it is determined that they are no
         longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
         example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
         requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions. Standard categorizations of audit records
         relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action are
         developed and disseminated. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
         General Records Schedules (GRS) provide federal policy on record retention.

AU-12    AUDIT GENERATION

         Control: The information system:

         a.     Provides audit record generation capability for the list of auditable events defined in AU-2 at
                [Assignment: organization-defined information system components];
         b.     Allows designated organizational personnel to select which auditable events are to be audited
                by specific components of the system; and
         c.     Generates audit records for the list of audited events defined in AU-2 with the content as
                defined in AU-3.
         Supplemental Guidance: Audits records can be generated from various components within the
         information system. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be
         generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is
         capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events). Related controls: AU-2, AU-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined
                information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-
                correlated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
                time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The audit trail is time-correlated if the time stamp in the
                individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamp in other audit records to
                achieve a time ordering of the records within the organization-defined tolerance.

         (2)    The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit
                records in a standardized format.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Audit information normalized to a common standard
                promotes interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and
                information systems. This facilitates an audit system that produces event information that can
                be more readily analyzed and correlated. System log records and audit records compliant
                with the Common Event Expression (CEE) are examples of standard formats for audit
                records. If individual logging mechanisms within the information system do not conform to a
                standardized format, the system may convert individual audit records into a standardized
                format when compiling the system-wide audit trail.

CA-1     SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     Formal, documented security assessment and authorization policies that address purpose,
                scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
                entities, and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security assessment
                and authorization policies and associated security assessment and authorization controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the security assessment and authorization family. The policies and procedures are consistent
         with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The security assessment/authorization policies can
         be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security
         assessment/authorization procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for
         a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a
         key factor in the development of the security assessment and authorization policy. Related

CA-2     SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including:
                - Security controls and control enhancements under assessment;
                - Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectiveness; and
                - Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities;
         b.     Assesses the security controls in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating
                as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                requirements for the system;
         c.     Produces a security assessment report that documents the results of the assessment; and
         d.     Provides the results of the security control assessment, in writing, to the authorizing official or
                authorizing official designated representative.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization assesses the security controls in an information system as
         part of: (i) security authorization or reauthorization; (ii) meeting the FISMA requirement for
         annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) testing/evaluation of the information
         system as part of the system development life cycle process. The assessment report documents the
         assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the organization, to determine the

         accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the security controls are implemented
         correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
         security requirements of the information system. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual
         security control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional
         assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security authorization
         process. To satisfy the FISMA annual assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the
         security control assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to:
         (i) assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization or reauthorization
         process; (ii) continuous monitoring (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of an information
         system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle (provided that the testing and
         evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness).
         Existing security control assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are
         supplemented with additional assessments as needed.
         Subsequent to the initial authorization of the information system and in accordance with OMB
         policy, the organization assesses a subset of the security controls annually during continuous
         monitoring. The organization establishes the security control selection criteria and subsequently
         selects a subset of the security controls within the information system and its environment of
         operation for assessment. Those security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most
         affected by ongoing changes to the information system or its environment of operation) or deemed
         critical by the organization to protecting organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
         organizations, and the Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational
         assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system’s
         three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current year’s assessment results
         from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement provided that
         the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control effectiveness. External
         audits (e.g., audits conducted by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the
         scope of this control. Related controls: CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, SA-11.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an
                assessment of the security controls in the information system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An independent assessor or assessment team is any
                individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational
                information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or
                actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management
                chain associated with the information system or to the determination of security control
                effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be obtained from other elements
                within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the
                organization. Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information
                system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence
                the impartiality of the assessor or assessment team conducting the assessment of the security
                controls in the information system. The authorizing official determines the required level of
                assessor independence based on the security categorization of the information system and/or
                the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, and to individuals. The authorizing
                official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence
                that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based
                decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information
                system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment be accomplished
                by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the
                system owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the
                assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to
                validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.
         (2)    The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organization-
                defined frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection: in-depth monitoring;
                malicious user testing; penetration testing; red team exercises; [Assignment: organization-defined

________________________________________________________________________________________________


                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing exercises both physical and technical
                security controls. A standard method for penetration testing consists of: (i) pretest analysis
                based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential
                vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability
                of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are agreed upon by all parties
                before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario. These rules of engagement are
                correlated with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by
                threat-sources in carrying out attacks. An organizational assessment of risk guides the
                decision on the level of independence required for penetration agents or penetration teams
                conducting penetration testing. Red team exercises are conducted as a simulated adversarial
                attempt to compromise organizational missions and/or business processes to provide a
                comprehensive assessment of the security capability of the information system and
                organization. While penetration testing may be laboratory-based testing, red team exercises
                are intended to be more comprehensive in nature and reflect real-world conditions.
                Information system monitoring, malicious user testing, penetration testing, red-team
                exercises, and other forms of security testing (e.g., independent verification and validation)
                are conducted to improve the readiness of the organization by exercising organizational
                capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of focusing organizational
                actions to improve the security state of the system and organization. Testing is conducted in
                accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
                and standards. Testing methods are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the
                organization’s Risk Executive Function. Vulnerabilities uncovered during red team exercises
                are incorporated into the vulnerability remediation process. Related controls: RA-5, SI-2.

CA-3     INFORMATION SYSTEM CONNECTIONS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Authorizes connections from the information system to other information systems outside of
                the authorization boundary through the use of Interconnection Security Agreements;
         b.     Documents, for each connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the
                nature of the information communicated; and
         c.     Monitors the information system connections on an ongoing basis verifying enforcement of
                security requirements.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems
         and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing.
         The organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when information systems
         are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both
         within the organization and external to the organization. Authorizing officials determine the risk
         associated with each connection and the appropriate controls employed. If the interconnecting
         systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection Security Agreement is not required.
         Rather, the interface characteristics between the interconnecting information systems are described
         in the security plans for the respective systems. If the interconnecting systems have different
         authorizing officials but the authorizing officials are in the same organization, the organization
         determines whether an Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the
         interface characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective
         systems. Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may choose
         to incorporate this information into a formal contract, especially if the interconnection is to be

         established between a federal agency and a nonfederal (private sector) organization. In every case,
         documenting the interface characteristics is required, yet the formality and approval process vary
         considerably even though all accomplish the same fundamental objective of managing the risk
         being incurred by the interconnection of the information systems. Risk considerations also
         include information systems sharing the same networks. Information systems may be identified
         and authenticated as devices in accordance with IA-3. Related controls: AC-4, IA-3, SC-7, SA-9.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization prohibits the direct connection of an unclassified, national security system to an
                external network.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An external network is a network that is not controlled by
                the organization (e.g., the Internet). No direct connection means that an information system
                cannot connect to an external network without the use of an approved boundary protection
                device (e.g., firewall) that mediates the communication between the system and the network.
         (2)    The organization prohibits the direct connection of a classified, national security system to an
                external network.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An external network is a network that is not controlled by
                the organization (e.g., the Internet). No direct connection means that an information system
                cannot connect to an external network without the use of an approved boundary protection
                device (e.g., firewall) that mediates the communication between the system and the network.
                In addition, the approved boundary protection device (typically a managed interface/cross-
                domain system), provides information flow enforcement from the information system to the
                external network consistent with AC-4.

                organization’s planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during
                the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the

         authorization package and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB.
         Related control: PM-4.
         Control Enhancements:

CA-6     SECURITY AUTHORIZATION

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Assigns a senior-level executive or manager to the role of authorizing official for the
                information system;
         b.     Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before
                commencing operations; and
         c.     Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: Security authorization is the official management decision, conveyed
         through the authorization decision document, given by a senior organizational official or executive
         (i.e., authorizing official) to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept
         the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
         based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Authorizing officials
         typically have budgetary oversight for information systems or are responsible for the mission or
         business operations supported by the systems. Security authorization is an inherently federal
         responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security
         authorization process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with
         information system operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions
         with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information
         system-related security risks. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous
         monitoring process, the critical information contained in the authorization package (i.e., the
         security plan (including risk assessment), the security assessment report, and the plan of action
         and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing the authorizing official and the
         information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system.
         To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the authorizing official uses the
         results of the continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for
         rendering a reauthorization decision. OMB policy requires that federal information systems are
         reauthorized at least every three years or when there is a significant change to the system. The
         organization defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system. Related
         controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.

         Control: The organization establishes a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a
         continuous monitoring program that includes:
          a.    A configuration management process for the information system and its constituent
                components;

                monitoring strategy; and
          d.    Reporting the security state of the information system to appropriate organizational officials
                [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the
         security authorization of an information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of
         operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes.
         Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near real-time
         risk management and promotes organizational situational awareness with regard to the security
         state of the information system. The implementation of a continuous monitoring program results
         in ongoing updates to the security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and
         milestones, the three principal documents in the security authorization package. A rigorous and
         well executed continuous monitoring program significantly reduces the level of effort required for
         the reauthorization of the information system. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
         accordance with the security categorization of the information system. Related controls: CA-2,
         CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to monitor the security
                controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization can extend and maximize the value of
                the ongoing assessment of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by
                requiring an independent assessor or team to assess all of the security controls during the
                information system’s three-year authorization cycle. See supplemental guidance for CA-2,
                enhancement (1), for further information on assessor independence. Related controls: CA-2,
                CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures are
                contained in Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Testing is intended to ensure that
                the information system continues to provide adequate security against constantly evolving
                threats and vulnerabilities. Conformance testing also provides independent validation. See
                supplemental guidance for CA-2, enhancement (2) for further information on malicious user
                testing, penetration testing, red-team exercises, and other forms of security testing. Related

         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration
                management policy and associated configuration management controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the configuration management family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
         federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The configuration management policy can be included as part of the
         general information security policy for the organization. Configuration management procedures
         can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system,
         when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of
         the configuration management policy. Related control: PM-9.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control establishes a baseline configuration for the information system
         and its constituent components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of the
         system. The baseline configuration provides information about the components of an information
         system (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation, server, network component, or mobile
         device including operating system/installed applications with current version numbers and patch
         information), network topology, and the logical placement of the component within the system
         architecture. The baseline configuration is a documented, up-to-date specification to which the
         information system is built. Maintaining the baseline configuration involves creating new
         baselines as the information system changes over time. The baseline configuration of the
         information system is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture. Related controls:
         CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Software inventory tools are examples of automated
                mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline configurations for
                information systems. Software inventory tools can be deployed for each operating system in
                use within the organization (e.g., on workstations, servers, network components, mobile
                devices) and used to track operating system version numbers, applications and types of
                software installed on the operating systems, and current patch levels. Software inventory
                tools can also scan information systems for unauthorized software to validate organization-
                defined lists of authorized and unauthorized software programs.
         (3)    The organization retains older versions of baseline configurations as deemed necessary to support

                (b) Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception authorization policy to identify software allowed to
                    execute on the information system.
         (5)    The organization:
                (a)    Develops and maintains [Assignment: organization-defined list of software programs
                       authorized to execute on the information system]; and

                (d) Inhibit change until designated approvals are received; and
                (e)    Document completed changes to the information system.
         (2)    The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before
                implementing the changes on the operational system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that testing does not interfere
                with information system operations. The individual/group conducting the tests understands
                the organizational information security policies and procedures, the information system
                security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
                associated with a particular facility and/or process. An operational system may need to be
                taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If an
                information system must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during
                planned system outages whenever possible. In situations where the organization cannot
                conduct testing of an operational system, the organization employs compensating controls
                (e.g., providing a replicated system to conduct testing) in accordance with the general
                tailoring guidance.
         (3)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current
                information system baseline and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.
         (4)    The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the
                [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element (e.g., committee, board)].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information security representatives can include, for
                example, information system security officers or information system security managers. The
                configuration change control element in this control enhancement is consistent with the
                change control element defined by the organization in CM-3.

CM-4     SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS

         Control: The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential
         security impacts prior to change implementation.
         Supplemental Guidance: Security impact analyses are conducted by organizational personnel with
         information security responsibilities, including for example, Information System Administrators,
         Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and Information
         System Security Engineers. Individuals conducting security impact analyses have the appropriate
         skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated
         security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing information
         system documentation such as the security plan to understand how specific security controls are



APPENDIX F-CM                                                                                              PAGE F-40

         implemented within the system and how the changes might affect the controls. Security impact
         analysis may also include an assessment of risk to understand the impact of the changes and to
         determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analysis is scaled in
         accordance with the security categorization of the information system. Related controls: CA-2,
         CA-7, CM-3, CM-9, SI-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization analyzes new software in a separate test environment before installation in an
                operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or
                intentional malice.
         (2)    The organization, after the information system is changed, checks the security functions to verify
                that the functions are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
                outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Changes include information system upgrades and
                modifications.

CM-5     ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE

         Control: The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access
         restrictions associated with changes to the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the
         information system can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system.
         Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to information
         system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.
         Additionally, maintaining records of access is essential for ensuring that configuration change
         control is being implemented as intended and for supporting after-the-fact actions should the
         organization become aware of an unauthorized change to the information system. Access
         restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of access restrictions include, for
         example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media
         libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party interface rather than
         directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only
         during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). Some
         or all of the enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control
         are included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control provides
         information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover specific needs related
         to enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information system, auditing changes, and
         retaining and review records of changes. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support
                auditing of the enforcement actions.
         (2)    The organization conducts audits of information system changes [Assignment: organization-
                defined frequency] and when indications so warrant to determine whether unauthorized changes
                have occurred.
         (3)    The information system prevents the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined critical
                software programs] that are not signed with a certificate that is recognized and approved by the
                organization.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Critical software programs and/or modules include, for
                example, patches, service packs, and where applicable, device drivers.



APPENDIX F-CM                                                                                              PAGE F-41

         (4)    The organization enforces a two-person rule for changes to [Assignment: organization-defined
                information system components and system-level information].
         (5)    The organization:
                (a)    Limits information system developer/integrator privileges to change hardware, software, and
                       firmware components and system information directly within a production environment; and
                (b) Reviews and reevaluates information system developer/integrator privileges [Assignment:
                    organization-defined frequency].
         (6)    The organization limits privileges to change software resident within software libraries (including
                privileged programs).
         (7)    The information system automatically implements [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards
                and countermeasures] if security functions (or mechanisms) are changed inappropriately.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The information system reacts automatically when
                inappropriate and/or unauthorized modifications have occurred to security functions or
                mechanisms. Automatic implementation of safeguards and countermeasures includes, for
                example, reversing the change, halting the information system or triggering an audit alert
                when an unauthorized modification to a critical security file occurs.

CM-6     CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Establishes and documents mandatory configuration settings for information technology
                products employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined
                security configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with
                operational requirements;
         b.     Implements the configuration settings;
         c.     Identifies, documents, and approves exceptions from the mandatory configuration settings for
                individual components within the information system based on explicit operational
                requirements; and
         d.     Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational
                policies and procedures.
         Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of
         information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related
         parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters
         related to meeting other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for
         example, registry settings; account, file, and directory settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for
         services, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
         mandatory configuration settings from which the settings for a given information system are
         derived. A security configuration checklist (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening
         guide, security guide, security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of
         instructions or procedures for configuring an information system component to meet operational
         requirements. Checklists can be developed by information technology developers and vendors,
         consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and other government organizations), and others
         in the public and private sectors. An example of a security configuration checklist is the Federal
         Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially affects the implementation of CM-6 and
         other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and
         defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an

         effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes
         federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems. Related controls:
         CM-2, CM-3, SI-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify
                configuration settings.
         (2)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to respond to unauthorized changes to
                [Assignment: organization-defined configuration settings].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Responses to unauthorized changes to configuration
                settings can include, for example, alerting designated organizational personnel, restoring
                mandatory/organization-defined configuration settings, or in the extreme case, halting
                affected information system processing.
         (3)    The organization incorporates detection of unauthorized, security-relevant configuration changes
                into the organization’s incident response capability to ensure that such detected events are
                tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: IR-4, IR-5.
         (4)    The information system (including modifications to the baseline configuration) demonstrates
                conformance to security configuration guidance (i.e., security checklists), prior to being introduced
                into a production environment.

CM-7     LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

         Control: The organization configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities
         and specifically prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or
         services: [Assignment: organization-defined list of prohibited or restricted functions, ports,
         protocols, and/or services].
         Supplemental Guidance: Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
         and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
         support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
         sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information
         system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
         Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g.,
         email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by organizational
         information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to
         determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet
         Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused
         or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB], File
         Transfer Protocol [FTP], Internet Protocol Version 6 [IPv6], Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
         [HTTP]) on information system components to prevent unauthorized connection of devices,
         unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize
         network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections
         such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of
         prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. Related control: RA-5.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to
                identify and eliminate unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

CM-8     INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY

         Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains an inventory of information system
         components that:
         a.     Accurately reflects the current information system;
         b.     Is consistent with the authorization boundary of the information system;
         c.     Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
         d.     Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve
                effective property accountability]; and
         e.     Is available for review and audit by designated organizational officials.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information deemed to be necessary by the organization to achieve
         effective property accountability can include, for example, hardware inventory specifications
         (manufacturer, type, model, serial number, physical location), software license information,
         information system/component owner, and for a networked component/device, the machine name
         and network address. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of
                component installations, removals, and information system updates.
         (2)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete,
                accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations maintain the information system inventory
                to the extent feasible. Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because they
                are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, the intent of this control
                enhancement is to maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is
                reasonable.
         (3)    The organization:
                (a)    Employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to detect the
                       addition of unauthorized components/devices into the information system; and
                (b) Disables network access by such components/devices or notifies designated organizational
                    officials.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is applied in addition to the
                monitoring for unauthorized remote connections in AC-17 and for unauthorized mobile
                devices in AC-19. The monitoring for unauthorized components/devices on information
                system networks may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of

                organizational networks for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be implemented within
                the information system and/or in another separate information system or device. Related
                controls: AC-17, AC-19.
         (4)    The organization includes in property accountability information for information system
                components, a means for identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role] individuals
                responsible for administering those components.
         (5)    The organization verifies that all components within the authorization boundary of the information
                system are either inventoried as a part of the system or recognized by another system as a
                component within that system.
         (6)    The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to
                current deployed configurations in the information system component inventory.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the configuration
                settings established by the organization for its information system components, the specific
                information system components that have been assessed to determine compliance with the
                required configuration settings, and any approved deviations from established configuration
                settings in the deployed information system components. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.

CM-9     CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN

         Control: The organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration management plan
         for the information system that:
         a.     Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;
         b.     Defines the configuration items for the information system and when in the system
                development life cycle the configuration items are placed under configuration management;
                and
         c.     Establishes the means for identifying configuration items throughout the system development
                life cycle and a process for managing the configuration of the configuration items.
         Supplemental Guidance: Configuration items are the information system items (hardware, software,
         firmware, and documentation) to be configuration managed. The configuration management plan
         satisfies the requirements in the organization’s configuration management policy while being
         tailored to the individual information system. The configuration management plan defines
         detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system
         development life cycle activities at the information system level. The plan describes how to move
         a change through the change management process, how configuration settings and configuration
         baselines are updated, how the information system component inventory is maintained, how
         development, test, and operational environments are controlled, and finally, how documents are
         developed, released, and updated. The configuration management approval process includes
         designation of key management stakeholders that are responsible for reviewing and approving
         proposed changes to the information system, and security personnel that would conduct an impact
         analysis prior to the implementation of any changes to the system. Related control: SA-10.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization assigns responsibility for developing the configuration management process to
                organizational personnel that are not directly involved in system development.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In the absence of a dedicated configuration management

CP-1     CONTINGENCY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented contingency planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning
                policy and associated contingency planning controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the contingency planning family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
         federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The contingency planning policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Contingency planning procedures can be
         developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when
         required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the
         contingency planning policy. Related control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

CP-2     CONTINGENCY PLAN

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Develops a contingency plan for the information system that:
                - Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency
                  requirements;
                - Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
                - Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact
                  information;
                - Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an information
                  system disruption, compromise, or failure;
                - Addresses eventual, full information system restoration without deterioration of the
                  security measures originally planned and implemented; and
                - Is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization;
         b.     Distributes copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined list of key
                contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
         c.     Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;
         d.     Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency];



APPENDIX F-CP                                                                                             PAGE F-47

         e.     Revises the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or
                environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation,
                execution, or testing; and
         f.     Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined list of key
                contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements].
         Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall
         organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations.
         Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of
         alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information system
         recovery objectives are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
         standards, or regulations. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also
         address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission/business effectiveness,
         such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of the information system.
         Examples of actions to call out in contingency plans include, for example, graceful degradation,
         information system shutdown, fall back to a manual mode, alternate information flows, or
         operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when the system is under attack. Related controls:
         AC-14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, IR-4, PM-8, PM-11.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization coordinates contingency plan development with organizational elements
                responsible for related plans.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of related plans include Business Continuity
                Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Crisis Communications Plan,
                Critical Infrastructure Plan, Cyber Incident Response Plan, and Occupant Emergency Plan.
         (2)    The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information
                processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency
                operations.
         (3)    The organization plans for the resumption of essential missions and business functions within
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency plan activation.
         (4)    The organization plans for the full resumption of missions and business functions within
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency plan activation.
         (5)    The organization plans for the continuance of essential missions and business functions with little
                or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity until full information system
                restoration at primary processing and/or storage sites.
         (6)    The organization provides for the transfer of all essential missions and business functions to
                alternate processing and/or storage sites with little or no loss of operational continuity and
                sustains that continuity through restoration to primary processing and/or storage sites.

CP-4     CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING AND EXERCISES

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Tests and/or exercises the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests and/or
                exercises] to determine the plan’s effectiveness and the organization’s readiness to execute
                the plan; and
         b.     Reviews the contingency plan test/exercise results and initiates corrective actions.
         Supplemental Guidance: There are several methods for testing and/or exercising contingency plans
         to identify potential weaknesses (e.g., checklist, walk-through/tabletop, simulation: parallel, full
         interrupt). Contingency plan testing and/or exercises include a determination of the effects on
         organizational operations and assets (e.g., reduction in mission capability) and individuals arising
         due to contingency operations in accordance with the plan.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization coordinates contingency plan testing and/or exercises with organizational
                elements responsible for related plans.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of related plans include Business Continuity
                Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Crisis Communications Plan,
                Critical Infrastructure Plan, Cyber Incident Response Plan, and Occupant Emergency Plan.
         (2)    The organization tests/exercises the contingency plan at the alternate processing site to familiarize
                contingency personnel with the facility and available resources and to evaluate the site’s
                capabilities to support contingency operations.
         (3)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test/exercise
                the contingency plan by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues, selecting more
                realistic test/exercise scenarios and environments, and more effectively stressing the information
                system and supported missions.
         (4)    The organization includes a full recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a known
                state as part of contingency plan testing.

         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated from the primary storage site
                so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Hazards of concern to the organization are typically
                defined in an organizational assessment of risk.
         (2)    The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in
                accordance with recovery time and recovery point objectives.
         (3)    The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the
                event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Explicit mitigation actions include, for example,
                duplicating backup information at another alternate storage site if access to the first alternate
                site is hindered; or, if electronic accessibility to the alternate site is disrupted, planning for
                physical access to retrieve backup information.

CP-10    INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

         Control: The organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the information system to
         a known state after a disruption, compromise, or failure.
         Supplemental Guidance: Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to
         restore essential missions and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery
         and includes activities for returning the information system to its original functional state before
         contingency plan activation. Recovery and reconstitution procedures are based on organizational
         priorities, established recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and appropriate metrics.
         Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system capability that may
         have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes an assessment of the
         fully restored information system capability, a potential system reauthorization and the necessary
         activities to prepare the system against another disruption, compromise, or failure. Recovery and
         reconstitution capabilities employed by the organization can be a combination of automated
         mechanisms and manual procedures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-6, CA-7, SC-24.

         (4)    The organization provides the capability to reimage information system components within
                [Assignment: organization-defined restoration time-periods] from configuration-controlled and
                integrity-protected disk images representing a secure, operational state for the components.
         (5)    The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near-real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined
                failover capability for the information system].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of failover capability are incorporating
                mirrored information system operations at an alternate processing site or periodic data

IA-1     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope,
                roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and
                authentication policy and associated identification and authentication controls.
         Supplemental Guidance:   This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the identification and authentication family. The policy and procedures are consistent with
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The identification and authentication policy can be
         included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Identification and
         authentication procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular
         information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor
         in the development of the identification and authentication policy. Related control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

IA-2     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)

         Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or
         processes acting on behalf of organizational users).
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the
         organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers,
         individuals from allied nations). Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses
         other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14.
         Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) may need
         to be considered for detailed accountability of activity. Authentication of user identities is
         accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor
         authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is
         defined as either local or network. Local access is any access to an organizational information
         system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct
         connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational
         information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained
         through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which involves
         communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
         area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are under the control of the
         organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is considered an internal network if
         the organization establishes the VPN connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a
         manner that does not require the organization to depend on any external networks across which the
         VPN transits to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification

         and authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational users
         are described in IA-8.
         The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by complying with
         Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with organization-specific implementation
         plans provided to OMB. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information-
         system level (i.e., at logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the
         application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
         Related controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts.
         (2)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged
                accounts.
         (3)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for local access to privileged accounts.
         (4)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for local access to non-privileged
                accounts.
         (5)    The organization:
                (a)    Allows the use of group authenticators only when used in conjunction with an
                       individual/unique authenticator; and
                (b) Requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a
                    group authenticator.
         (6)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts
                where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the information system being
                accessed.
         (7)    The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged
                accounts where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the information system
                being accessed.
         (8)    The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined replay-resistant authentication
                mechanisms] for network access to privileged accounts.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is
                impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous
                authentication message. Techniques used to address this include protocols that use nonces or
                challenges (e.g., TLS), and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
         (9)    The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined replay-resistant authentication
                mechanisms] for network access to non-privileged accounts.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is

IA-3     DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

         Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organization-
         defined list of specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a connection.




APPENDIX F-IA                                                                                                PAGE F-55

________________________________________________________________________________________________


         Supplemental Guidance: The devices requiring unique identification and authentication may be
         defined by type, by specific device, or by a combination of type and device as deemed appropriate
         by the organization. The information system typically uses either shared known information (e.g.,
         Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]
         addresses) for identification or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and
         Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security
         [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area
         networks. The required strength of the device authentication mechanism is determined by the
         security categorization of the information system.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system authenticates devices before establishing remote and wireless network
                connections using bidirectional authentication between devices that is cryptographically based.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Remote network connection is any connection with a
                device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Related controls: AC-
                17, AC-18.
         (2)    The information system authenticates devices before establishing network connections using
                bidirectional authentication between devices that is cryptographically based.
         (3)    The organization standardizes, with regard to dynamic address allocation, Dynamic Host Control
                Protocol (DHCP) lease information and the time assigned to devices, and audits lease information
                when assigned to a device.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: With regard to dynamic address allocation for devices,
                DHCP-enabled clients typically obtain leases for IP addresses from DHCP servers.

IA-4     IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages information system identifiers for users and devices by:

         a.     Receiving authorization from a designated organizational official to assign a user or device
                identifier;
         b.     Selecting an identifier that uniquely identifies an individual or device;
         c.     Assigning the user identifier to the intended party or the device identifier to the intended
                device;
         d.     Preventing reuse of user or device identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time
                period]; and
         e.     Disabling the user identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of
                inactivity].
         Supplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC) or Internet
         protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of user identifiers is not
         applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). It is
         commonly the case that a user identifier is the name of an information system account associated
         with an individual. In such instances, identifier management is largely addressed by the account
         management activities of AC-2. IA-4 also covers user identifiers not necessarily associated with
         an information system account (e.g., the identifier used in a physical security control database
         accessed by a badge reader system for access to the information system). Related control: AC-2,
         IA-2.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

         Control Enhancements:
         (1)       The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers as public identifiers
                   for user electronic mail accounts (i.e., user identifier portion of the electronic mail address).

                   Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization implements this control enhancement to
                   the extent that the information system allows.
         (2)       The organization requires that registration to receive a user ID and password include authorization
                   by a supervisor, and be done in person before a designated registration authority.
         (3)       The organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification such as
                   documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics be presented to the
                   registration authority.
         (4)       The organization manages user identifiers by uniquely identifying the user as [Assignment:
                   organization-defined characteristic identifying user status].

                   Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Characteristics identifying user status include, for
                   example, contractors and foreign nationals.
         (5)       The information system dynamically manages identifiers, attributes, and associated access
                   authorizations.

                   Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional approaches to identification
                   and authentication which employ static information system accounts for preregistered users,
                   many service-oriented architecture implementations rely on establishing identities at run time
                   for entities that were previously unknown. Dynamic establishment of identities and
                   association of attributes and privileges with these identities is anticipated and provisioned.
                   Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
                   identities and related credentials are essential.

IA-5     AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization manages information system authenticators for users and devices by:

         a.        Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual and/or
                   device receiving the authenticator;
         b.        Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
         c.        Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
         d.        Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution,
                   for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
         e.        Changing default content of authenticators upon information system installation;
         f.        Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for
                   authenticators (if appropriate);
         g.        Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by
                   authenticator type];
         h.        Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification; and
         i.        Requiring users to take, and having devices implement, specific measures to safeguard
                   authenticators.

Special Publication 800-53           Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


         Supplemental Guidance: User authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics,
         PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial
         password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password
         length). Many information system components are shipped with factory default authentication
         credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are
         often well known, easily discoverable, present a significant security risk, and therefore, are
         changed upon installation. The requirement to protect user authenticators may be implemented via
         control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of users and by controls AC-3, AC-6,
         and SC-28 for authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a
         hashed or encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with
         super user privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by
         organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including,
         for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time
         synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during verification stage of
         biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators include, for example,
         maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with
         others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management
         includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as
         that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and
         passwords. Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, PL-4, PS-6.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system, for password-based authentication:
                (a)   Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements
                      for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters,
                      numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
                (b) Enforces at least a [Assignment: organization-defined number of changed characters] when
                    new passwords are created;
                (c)   Encrypts passwords in storage and in transmission;
                (d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-
                    defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum]; and
                (e)   Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is intended primarily for
                environments where passwords are used as a single factor to authenticate users, or in a similar
                manner along with one or more additional authenticators. The enhancement generally does
                not apply to situations where passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators. The
                implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the requirements in the
                enhancement.
         (2)    The information system, for PKI-based authentication:
                (a)   Validates certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an
                      accepted trust anchor;
                (b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key; and
                (c)   Maps the authenticated identity to the user account.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Status information for certification paths includes, for
                example, certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
         (3)    The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organization-
                defined types of and/or specific authenticators] be carried out in person before a designated
                registration authority with authorization by a designated organizational official (e.g., a supervisor).
         (4)    The organization employs automated tools to determine if authenticators are sufficiently strong to
                resist attacks intended to discover or otherwise compromise the authenticators.
         (5)    The organization requires vendors and/or manufacturers of information system components to
                provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for
                organizations to change default authenticators upon information system installation, by
                requiring vendors and/or manufacturers of information system components to provide unique
                authenticators or change default authenticators for those components prior to delivery to the
                organization. Unique authenticators are assigned by vendors and/or manufacturers to specific
                information system components (i.e., delivered information technology products) with distinct
                serial numbers. This requirement is included in acquisition documents prepared by the
                organization when procuring information systems and/or information system components.
         (6)    The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the
                information accessed.
         (7)    The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications
                or access scripts or stored on function keys.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations exercise caution in determining whether an
                embedded or stored authenticator is in encrypted or unencrypted form. If the authenticator in
                its stored representation, is used in the manner stored, then that representation is considered
                an unencrypted authenticator. This is irrespective of whether that representation is perhaps an
                encrypted version of something else (e.g., a password).
         (8)    The organization takes [Assignment: organization-defined measures] to manage the risk of
                compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: When an individual has accounts on multiple information
                systems, there is the risk that if one account is compromised and the individual is using the
                same user identifier and authenticator, other accounts will be compromised as well. Possible
                alternatives include, but are not limited to: (i) having the same user identifier but different
                authenticators on all systems; (ii) having different user identifiers and authenticators on each
                system; (iii) employing some form of single sign-on mechanism; or (iv) including some form
                of one-time passwords on all systems.

IA-6     AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK

         Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the
         authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized
         individuals.
         Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from the information system does not provide information
         that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. Displaying
         asterisks when a user types in a password, is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication
         information.

IA-8     IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)

         Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or
         processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).
         Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizational users include all information system users other than
         organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. Users are uniquely identified and authenticated
         for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization
         in accordance with AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative,
         authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required
         to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national
         security systems). Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs
         of the organization. Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in
         balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems
         with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational
         assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Identification and authentication
         requirements for information system access by organizational users are described in IA-2. Related
         controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, MA-4.

IR-1     INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response
                policy and associated incident response controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the incident response family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal
         laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The incident response policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Incident response procedures can be developed
         for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The
         organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the incident
         response policy. Related control: PM-9.

         system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined
         tests and/or exercises] to determine the incident response effectiveness and documents the results.
         Supplemental Guidance: None.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively test/exercise
                the incident response capability.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can provide the ability to more
                thoroughly and effectively test or exercise the incident response capability by providing more
                complete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic test/exercise scenarios
                and environments, and more effectively stressing the response capability. Related control:

IR-4     INCIDENT HANDLING

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation,
                detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;
         b.     Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and
         c.     Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response
                procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.
         Supplemental Guidance: Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources
         including, but not limited to, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
         and user/administrator reports. Related controls: AU-6, CP-2, IR-2, IR-3, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3,
         SI-4, SI-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An online incident management system is an example of
                an automated mechanism.
         (2)    The organization includes dynamic reconfiguration of the information system as part of the
                incident response capability.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes
                to router rules, access control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and
                filter rules for firewalls and gateways.
         (3)    The organization identifies classes of incidents and defines appropriate actions to take in response
                to ensure continuation of organizational missions and business functions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions
                due to design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted
                malicious attacks. Incident response actions that may be appropriate include, for example,
                graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode or alternative
                technology whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures (e.g.,

IR-6     INCIDENT REPORTING

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident
                response capability within [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]; and
         b.     Reports security incident information to designated authorities.
         Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting
         requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal
         agencies and their subordinate organizations. The types of security incidents reported, the content
         and timeliness of the reports, and the list of designated reporting authorities are consistent with
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted
         from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency
         Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of
         Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5.

         organizational incident response capability, that offers advice and assistance to users of the
         information system for the handling and reporting of security incidents.
         Supplemental Guidance: Possible implementations of incident response support resources in an
         organization include a help desk or an assistance group and access to forensics services, when
         required. Related controls: IR-4, IR-6.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to increase the availability of incident response-
                related information and support.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms can provide a push and/or pull
                capability for users to obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals might
                have access to a website to query the assistance capability, or conversely, the assistance
                capability may have the ability to proactively send information to users (general distribution
                or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response capabilities and support.
         (2)    The organization:
                (a)    Establishes a direct, cooperative relationship between its incident response capability and
                       external providers of information system protection capability; and
                (b) Identifies organizational incident response team members to the external providers.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: External providers of information system protection
                capability include, for example, the Computer Network Defense program within the U.S.
                Department of Defense. External providers help to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and

                - Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure,
                  and functions;
                - Defines reportable incidents;
                - Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization.
                - Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature
                  an incident response capability; and
                - Is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization;
         b.     Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment: organization-defined list of
                incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
         c.     Reviews the incident response plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
         d.     Revises the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems
                encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing; and
         e.     Communicates incident response plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined list of
                incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements].
         Supplemental Guidance: It is important that organizations have a formal, focused, and coordinated
         approach to responding to incidents. The organization’s mission, strategies, and goals for incident
         response help determine the structure of its incident response capability.

MA-1     SYSTEM MAINTENANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented information system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope,
                roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the information system
                maintenance policy and associated system maintenance controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the system maintenance family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
         federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The information system maintenance policy can be included as part of
         the general information security policy for the organization. System maintenance procedures can
         be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when
         required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the
         system maintenance policy. Related control: PM-9.

MA-2     CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of maintenance and repairs on
                information system components in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications
                and/or organizational requirements;
         b.     Controls all maintenance activities, whether performed on site or remotely and whether the
                equipment is serviced on site or removed to another location;
         c.     Requires that a designated official explicitly approve the removal of the information system or
                system components from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;
         d.     Sanitizes equipment to remove all information from associated media prior to removal from
                organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs; and
         e.     Checks all potentially impacted security controls to verify that the controls are still
                functioning properly following maintenance or repair actions.
         Supplemental Guidance: The control is intended to address the information security aspects of the
         organization’s information system maintenance program. Related controls: MP-6, SI-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization maintains maintenance records for the information system that include:
                (a)    Date and time of maintenance;
                (b) Name of the individual performing the maintenance;

MA-3     MAINTENANCE TOOLS

         Control: The organization approves, controls, monitors the use of, and maintains on an ongoing
         basis, information system maintenance tools.
         Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address the security-related issues arising
         from the hardware and software brought into the information system specifically for diagnostic
         and repair actions (e.g., a hardware or software packet sniffer that is introduced for the purpose of
         a particular maintenance activity). Hardware and/or software components that may support
         information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing
         “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an
         Ethernet switch) are not covered by this control. Related control: MP-6.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization inspects all maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel
                for obvious improper modifications.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Maintenance tools include, for example, diagnostic and
                test equipment used to conduct maintenance on the information system.
         (2)    The organization checks all media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code
                before the media are used in the information system.
         (3)    The organization prevents the unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment by one of the
                following: (i) verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the equipment; (ii)
                sanitizing or destroying the equipment; (iii) retaining the equipment within the facility; or (iv)
                obtaining an exemption from a designated organization official explicitly authorizing removal of the
                equipment from the facility.
         (4)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict the use of maintenance tools to
                authorized personnel only.

MA-4     NON-LOCAL MAINTENANCE

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Authorizes, monitors, and controls non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities;
         b.     Allows the use of non-local maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with
                organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the information system;

         c.     Employs strong identification and authentication techniques in the establishment of non-local
                maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
         d.     Maintains records for non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
         e.     Terminates all sessions and network connections when non-local maintenance is completed.
         Supplemental Guidance: Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
         conducted by individuals communicating through a network; either an external network (e.g., the
         Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
         carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system
         component and not communicating across a network connection. Identification and authentication
         techniques used in the establishment of non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions are
         consistent with the network access requirements in IA-2. Strong authenticators include, for
         example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or
         biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part, by other controls. Related
         controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, IA-2, IA-8, MA-5, MP-6, SC-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization audits non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions and designated
                organizational personnel review the maintenance records of the sessions.
         (2)    The organization documents, in the security plan for the information system, the installation and
                use of non-local maintenance and diagnostic connections.
         (3)    The organization:
                (a)    Requires that non-local maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from an
                       information system that implements a level of security at least as high as that implemented on
                       the system being serviced; or
                (b) Removes the component to be serviced from the information system and prior to non-local
                    maintenance or diagnostic services, sanitizes the component (with regard to organizational
                    information) before removal from organizational facilities, and after the service is performed,
                    inspects and sanitizes the component (with regard to potentially malicious software and
                    surreptitious implants) before reconnecting the component to the information system.
         (4)    The organization protects non-local maintenance sessions through the use of a strong
                authenticator tightly bound to the user and by separating the maintenance session from other
                network sessions with the information system by either:
                (a)    Physically separated communications paths; or
                (b) Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-13.
         (5)    The organization requires that:
                (a)    Maintenance personnel notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel] when non-local
                       maintenance is planned (i.e., date/time); and
                (b) A designated organizational official with specific information security/information system
                    knowledge approves the non-local maintenance.
         (6)    The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity and confidentiality of
                non-local maintenance and diagnostic communications.
         (7)    The organization employs remote disconnect verification at the termination of non-local
                maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

MA-5     MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains a current list of
                authorized maintenance organizations or personnel; and
         b.     Ensures that personnel performing maintenance on the information system have required
                access authorizations or designates organizational personnel with required access
                authorizations and technical competence deemed necessary to supervise information system
                maintenance when maintenance personnel do not possess the required access authorizations.
         Supplemental Guidance: Individuals not previously identified in the information system, such as
         vendor personnel and consultants, may legitimately require privileged access to the system, for
         example, when required to conduct maintenance or diagnostic activities with little or no notice.
         Based on a prior assessment of risk, the organization may issue temporary credentials to these
         individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for a very limited time period.
         Related controls: IA-8, MA-5.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization maintains procedures for the use of maintenance personnel that lack appropriate
                security clearances or are not U.S. citizens, that include the following requirements:
                (a)    Maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations, clearances, or formal
                       access approvals are escorted and supervised during the performance of maintenance and
                       diagnostic activities on the information system by approved organizational personnel who are
                       fully cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and are technically qualified;
                (b) Prior to initiating maintenance or diagnostic activities by personnel who do not have needed
                    access authorizations, clearances or formal access approvals, all volatile information storage
                    components within the information system are sanitized and all nonvolatile storage media are
                    removed or physically disconnected from the system and secured; and
                (c)    In the event an information system component cannot be sanitized, the procedures contained
                       in the security plan for the system are enforced.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control enhancement is to deny
                individuals who lack appropriate security clearances (i.e., individuals who do not possess
                security clearances or possess security clearances at a lower level than required) or who are
                not U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to any classified information, Controlled
                Unclassified Information (CUI), or any other sensitive information contained on the
                information system. Procedures for the use of maintenance personnel can be documented in
                the security plan for the information system.
         (2)    The organization ensures that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on an
                information system processing, storing, or transmitting classified information are cleared (i.e.,
                possess appropriate security clearances) for the highest level of information on the system.
         (3)    The organization ensures that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on an
                information system processing, storing, or transmitting classified information are U.S. citizens.
         (4)    The organization ensures that:
                (a)    Cleared foreign nationals (i.e., foreign nationals with appropriate security clearances), are
                       used to conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on an information system only when
                       the system is jointly owned and operated by the United States and foreign allied governments,
                       or owned and operated solely by foreign allied governments; and
                (b) Approvals, consents, and detailed operational conditions regarding the use of foreign
                    nationals to conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on an information system are fully
                    documented within a Memorandum of Agreement.

MP-2     MEDIA ACCESS

         Control: The organization restricts access to [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and
         non-digital media] to [Assignment: organization-defined list of authorized individuals] using
         [Assignment: organization-defined security measures].
         Supplemental Guidance:   Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
         magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
         disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile
         computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop
         computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording
         devices). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated
         information contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document in policy
         and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media,
         and the specific measures taken to restrict access. Fewer protection measures are needed for
         media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be
         publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact if accessed by other than authorized
         personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the media
         resides provide adequate protection. Related controls: MP-4, PE-3.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage areas and to
                audit access attempts and access granted.

         a.     Marks, in accordance with organizational policies and procedures, removable information
                system media and information system output indicating the distribution limitations, handling
                caveats, and applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and
         b.     Exempts [Assignment: organization-defined list of removable media types] from marking as
                long as the exempted items remain within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled
                areas].
         Supplemental Guidance: The term marking is used when referring to the application or use of
         human-readable security attributes. The term labeling is used when referring to the application or
         use of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within the information system (see
         AC-16, Security Attributes). Removable information system media includes both digital media
         (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks,
         digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). An organizational assessment
         of risk guides the selection of media requiring marking. Marking is generally not required for
         media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain or to be
         publicly releasable. Some organizations, however, may require markings for public information
         indicating that the information is publicly releasable. Organizations may extend the scope of this
         control to include information system output devices containing organizational information,
         including, for example, monitors and printers. Marking of removable media and information
         system output is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
         regulations, standards, and guidance.

         Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
         magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
         disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile
         computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop
         computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording
         devices). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability
         to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do
         not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically
         employed in other information systems, organizational personnel use extreme caution in the types
         of information stored on telephone voicemail systems. A controlled area is any area or space for
         which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections are sufficient
         to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system.
         An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
         contained on that media requiring physical protection. Fewer protection measures are needed for
         media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be
         publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if
         accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical
         access controls to the facility where the media resides provide adequate protection.
         As part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting information
         at rest on selected secondary storage devices. The employment of cryptography is at the discretion
         of the information owner/steward. The selection of the cryptographic mechanisms used is based
         upon maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the information. The strength of mechanisms
         is commensurate with the classification and sensitivity of the information. Related controls: AC-
         3, AC-19, CP-6, CP-9, MP-2, PE-3.

MP-5     MEDIA TRANSPORT

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and non-digital
                media] during transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment: organization-defined
                security measures];
         b.     Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled
                areas; and
         c.     Restricts the activities associated with transport of such media to authorized personnel.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
         magnetic tapes, removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and
         non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile computing and
         communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers,
         personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices) that
         are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also considered information
         systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail
         systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication,

         and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational
         personnel use caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems that are
         transported outside of controlled areas. A controlled area is any area or space for which the
         organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to
         meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system.
         Physical and technical security measures for the protection of digital and non-digital media are
         commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information residing on the media, and
         consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
         standards, and guidance. Locked containers and cryptography are examples of security measures
         available to protect digital and non-digital media during transport. Cryptographic mechanisms can
         provide confidentiality and/or integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. An
         organizational assessment of risk guides: (i) the selection of media and associated information
         contained on that media requiring protection during transport; and (ii) the selection and use of
         storage containers for transporting non-digital media. Authorized transport and courier personnel
         may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial
         transport or delivery service). Related controls: AC-19, CP-9.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    [Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-5].
         (2)    The organization documents activities associated with the transport of information system media.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations establish documentation requirements for
                activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with the
                organizational assessment of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping
                methods for different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related
                records.
         (3)    The organization employs an identified custodian throughout the transport of information system
                media.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Custodial responsibilities can be transferred from one
                individual to another as long as an unambiguous custodian is identified at all times.
         (4)    The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
                information stored on digital media during transport outside of controlled areas.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement also applies to mobile devices.
                Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks, external hard disk
                drives) and portable computing and communications devices with storage capability (e.g.,

MP-6     MEDIA SANITIZATION

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Sanitizes information system media, both digital and non-digital, prior to disposal, release out
                of organizational control, or release for reuse; and
         b.     Employs sanitization mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the
                classification or sensitivity of the information.




APPENDIX F-MP                                                                                                PAGE F-74
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all media subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not
         considered removable. Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information
         system media such that there is reasonable assurance that the information cannot be retrieved or
         reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, and destroying media
         information, prevent the disclosure of organizational information to unauthorized individuals
         when such media is reused or released for disposal. The organization uses its discretion on the
         employment of sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed
         to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on the
         organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and disposal actions.
         (2)    The organization tests sanitization equipment and procedures to verify correct performance
                [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         (3)    The organization sanitizes portable, removable storage devices prior to connecting such devices
                to the information system under the following circumstances: [Assignment: organization-defined
                list of circumstances requiring sanitization of portable, removable storage devices].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Portable, removable storage devices (e.g., thumb drives,
                flash drives, external storage devices) can be the source of malicious code insertions into
                organizational information systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown
                sources and may contain various types of malicious code that can be readily transferred to the
                information system through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning such devices is
                always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the device is free of all
                malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider
                sanitization of portable, removable storage devices, for example, when such devices are first
                purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when the organization loses
                a positive chain of custody for the device. An organizational assessment of risk guides the
                specific circumstances for employing the sanitization process. Related control: SI-3.
         (4)    The organization sanitizes information system media containing Controlled Unclassified
                Information (CUI) or other sensitive information in accordance with applicable organizational
                and/or federal standards and policies.
         (5)    The organization sanitizes information system media containing classified information in
                accordance with NSA standards and policies.
         (6)    The organization destroys information system media that cannot be sanitized.

                environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental protection
                controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the physical and environmental protection family. The policy and procedures are consistent
         with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The physical and environmental protection policy
         can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Physical
         and environmental protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general and
         for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy
         is a key factor in the development of the physical and environmental protection policy. Related

PE-3     PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Enforces physical access authorizations for all physical access points (including designated
                entry/exit points) to the facility where the information system resides (excluding those areas
                within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible);
         b.     Verifies individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility;
         c.     Controls entry to the facility containing the information system using physical access devices
                and/or guards;
         d.     Controls access to areas officially designated as publicly accessible in accordance with the
                organization’s assessment of risk;
         e.     Secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;
         f.     Inventories physical access devices [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
         g.     Changes combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when keys
                are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the types of guards needed, for example,
         professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information
         system users, as deemed appropriate. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks,
         combinations, and card readers. Workstations and associated peripherals connected to (and part
         of) an organizational information system may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible
         with access to such devices being safeguarded. Related controls: MP-2, MP-4, PE-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization enforces physical access authorizations to the information system independent
                of the physical access controls for the facility.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to server rooms, media
                storage areas, communications centers, or any other areas within an organizational facility
                containing large concentrations of information system components. The intent is to provide
                additional physical security for those areas where the organization may be more vulnerable
                due to the concentration of information system components. Security requirements for
                facilities containing organizational information systems that process, store, or transmit
                Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) are consistent with applicable federal laws,
                Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. See also PS-3,
                security requirements for personnel access to SCI.
         (2)    The organization performs security checks at the physical boundary of the facility or information
                system for unauthorized exfiltration of information or information system components.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The extent/frequency or randomness of the checks is as
                deemed necessary by the organization to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.
         (3)    The organization guards, alarms, and monitors every physical access point to the facility where the
                information system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

PE-4     ACCESS CONTROL FOR TRANSMISSION MEDIUM

         Control: The organization controls physical access to information system distribution and
         transmission lines within organizational facilities.
         Supplemental Guidance: Physical protections applied to information system distribution and
         transmission lines help prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering.
         Additionally, physical protections are necessary to help prevent eavesdropping or in transit

PS-1     PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented personnel security policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
                responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
                compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personnel security
                policy and associated personnel security controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the personnel security family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal
         laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The personnel security policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Personnel security procedures can be developed
         for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The
         organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the personnel
         security policy. Related control: PM-9.

         b.     Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined list of conditions
                requiring rescreening and, where re-screening is so indicated, the frequency of such
                rescreening].
         Supplemental Guidance: Screening and rescreening are consistent with applicable federal laws,
         Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and the criteria established
         for the risk designation of the assigned position. The organization may define different rescreening
         conditions and frequencies for personnel accessing the information system based on the type of
         information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization ensures that every user accessing an information system processing, storing, or
                transmitting classified information is cleared and indoctrinated to the highest classification level of
                the information on the system.
         (2)    The organization ensures that every user accessing an information system processing, storing, or
                transmitting types of classified information which require formal indoctrination, is formally
                indoctrinated for all of the relevant types of information on the system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Types of information requiring formal indoctrination
                include, for example, Special Access Program (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), and Sensitive
                Compartment Information (SCI).

         Control: The organization, upon termination of individual employment:

         a.     Terminates information system access;
         b.     Conducts exit interviews;
         c.     Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property; and
         d.     Retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by
                terminated individual.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware
         authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and
         building passes. Exit interviews ensure that individuals understand any security constraints
         imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for all information
         system-related property. Exit interviews may not be possible for some employees (e.g., in the case
         of job abandonment, some illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors). Exit interviews are
         important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of this control is particularly
         essential for employees or contractors terminated for cause.

         systems/facilities when personnel are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the
         organization and initiates [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions]
         within [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the formal transfer action].
         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies when the reassignment or transfer of an employee is
         permanent or of such an extended duration as to make the actions warranted. In addition the
         organization defines the actions appropriate for the type of reassignment or transfer; whether
         permanent or temporary. Actions that may be required when personnel are transferred or
         reassigned to other positions within the organization include, for example: (i) returning old and
         issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; (ii) closing previous information
         system accounts and establishing new accounts; (iii) changing information system access
         authorizations; and (iv) providing for access to official records to which the employee had access

                systems sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access; and
         b.     Reviews/updates the access agreements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
         Supplemental Guidance: Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements,
         acceptable use agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access
         agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand, and agree to
         abide by the constraints associated with the information system to which access is authorized.
         Electronic signatures are acceptable for use in acknowledging access agreements unless
         specifically prohibited by organizational policy. Related control: PL-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization ensures that access to information with special protection measures is granted
                only to individuals who:

                compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy
                and associated risk assessment controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the risk assessment family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal
         laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing
         organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and
         procedures unnecessary. The risk assessment policy can be included as part of the general
         information security policy for the organization. Risk assessment procedures can be developed for
         the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The
         organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the risk assessment
         policy. Related control: PM-9.

         b.     Documents the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security
                plan for the information system; and
         c.     Ensures the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing
                official or authorizing official designated representative.
         Supplemental Guidance: A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective
         security categorization. Security categorization describes the potential adverse impacts to
         organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals should the information and
         information system be comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The
         organization conducts the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the
         involvement of the chief information officer, senior information security officer, information
         system owner, mission owners, and information owners/stewards. The organization also considers

         of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts in
         categorizing the information system. The security categorization process facilitates the creation of
         an inventory of information assets, and in conjunction with CM-8, a mapping to the information
         system components where the information is processed, stored, and transmitted. Related controls:
         CM-8, MP-4, SC-7.

RA-3     RISK ASSESSMENT

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the
                unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the
                information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;
         b.     Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report;
                [Assignment: organization-defined document]];
         c.     Reviews risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
         d.     Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there
                are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the
                identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the
                security state of the system.
         Supplemental Guidance: A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective
         risk assessment. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security
         controls planned or in place to determine the level of residual risk posed to organizational
         operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation of
         the information system. Risk assessments also take into account risk posed to organizational
         operations, organizational assets, or individuals from external parties (e.g., service providers,
         contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing
         organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and
         related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information
         systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such,
         organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems. The
         General Services Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment
         dealing with public access to federal information systems.
         Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at various steps in
         the Risk Management Framework including: information system categorization; security control
         selection; security control implementation; security control assessment; information system
         authorization; and security control monitoring. RA-3 is a noteworthy security control in that the
         control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to
         complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an
         important role in the security control selection process during the application of tailoring guidance
         for security control baselines and when considering supplementing the tailored baselines with
         additional security controls or control enhancements.

RA-4     RISK ASSESSMENT UPDATE

         [Withdrawn: Incorporated into RA-3].



RA-5     VULNERABILITY SCANNING

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined
                process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are
                identified and reported;
         b.     Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among
                tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
                - Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
                - Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
                - Measuring vulnerability impact;
         c.     Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
         d.     Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in
                accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
         e.     Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control
                assessments with designated personnel throughout the organization to help eliminate similar
                vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
         Supplemental Guidance: The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency
         and comprehensiveness of the vulnerability scans. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and
         applications may require additional, more specialized techniques and approaches (e.g., web-based
         application scanners, source code reviews, source code analyzers). Vulnerability scanning
         includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be
         accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information
         flow mechanisms. The organization considers using tools that express vulnerabilities in the
         Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open
         Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities. The
         Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are also
         excellent sources for vulnerability information. In addition, security control assessments such as
         red team exercises are another source of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Related
         controls: CA-2, CM-6, RA-3, SI-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update
                the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned.
         (2)    The organization updates the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.
         (3)    The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can demonstrate the breadth and
                depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).
         (4)    The organization attempts to discern what information about the information system is
                discoverable by adversaries.
         (5)    The organization includes privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-identified
                information system components] for selected vulnerability scanning activities to facilitate more
                thorough scanning.
         (6)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans
                over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.

         (7)    The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
                to detect the presence of unauthorized software on organizational information systems and notify
                designated organizational officials.
         (8)    The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the
                information system has been previously exploited.
         (9)    The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to:
                (a)    Conduct a vulnerability analysis on the information system; and
                (b) Perform penetration testing on the information system based on the vulnerability analysis to
                    determine the exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: A standard method for penetration testing includes: (i)
                pre-test analysis based on full knowledge of the target information system; (ii) pre-test
                identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pre-test analysis; and (iii) testing designed
                to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are
                agreed upon by all parties before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario.

SA-1     SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented system and services acquisition policy that includes information
                security considerations and that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
                commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services
                acquisition policy and associated system and services acquisition controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the system and services acquisition family. The policy and procedures are consistent with
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and services acquisition policy can be
         included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and
         services acquisition procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a
         particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a
         key factor in the development of the system and services acquisition policy. Related control: PM-

SA-4     ACQUISITIONS

         Control: The organization includes the following requirements and/or specifications, explicitly or
         by reference, in information system acquisition contracts based on an assessment of risk and in
         accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
         standards:
         a.     Security functional requirements/specifications;
         b.     Security-related documentation requirements; and
         c.     Developmental and evaluation-related assurance requirements.
         Supplemental Guidance: The acquisition documents for information systems, information system
         components, and information system services include, either explicitly or by reference, security
         requirements that describe: (i) required security capabilities (i.e., security needs and, as necessary,
         specific security controls and other specific FISMA requirements); (ii) required design and
         development processes; (iii) required test and evaluation procedures; and (iv) required
         documentation. The requirements in the acquisition documents permit updating security controls
         as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented. Acquisition
         documents also include requirements for appropriate information system documentation. The
         documentation addresses user and system administrator guidance and information regarding the
         implementation of the security controls in the information system. The level of detail required in
         the documentation is based on the security categorization for the information system. In addition,
         the required documentation includes security configuration settings and security implementation
         guidance. FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for
         federal information systems.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization requires in acquisition documents that vendors/contractors provide information
                describing the functional properties of the security controls to be employed within the information
                system, information system components, or information system services in sufficient detail to
                permit analysis and testing of the controls.
         (2)    The organization requires in acquisition documents that vendors/contractors provide information
                describing the design and implementation details of the security controls to be employed within
                the information system, information system components, or information system services
                (including functional interfaces among control components) in sufficient detail to permit analysis
                and testing of the controls.

         (3)    The organization requires software vendors/manufacturers to demonstrate that their software
                development processes employ state-of-the-practice software and security engineering methods,
                quality control processes, and validation techniques to minimize flawed or malformed software.
         (4)    The organization ensures that each information system component acquired is explicitly assigned
                to an information system, and that the owner of the system acknowledges this assignment.
         (5)    The organization requires in acquisition documents, that information system components are
                delivered in a secure, documented configuration, and that the secure configuration is the default
                configuration for any software reinstalls or upgrades.
         (6)    The organization:
                (a)    Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
                       information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products that composes an
                       NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit
                       the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and
                (b) Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by the NSA or in
                    accordance with NSA-approved procedures.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products
                used to protect classified information by cryptographic means, may be required to use NSA-
                approved key management.
         (7)    The organization:
                (a)    Limits the use of commercially provided information technology products to those products
                       that have been successfully evaluated against a validated U.S. Government Protection Profile
                       for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and
                (b) Requires, if no U.S. Government Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a
                    commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality
                    to enforce its security policy, then the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated.

         c.     Documents attempts to obtain information system documentation when such documentation is
                either unavailable or nonexistent.
         Supplemental Guidance: The inability of the organization to obtain necessary information system
         documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the system and/or lack of support from
         the vendor/contractor. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected information
         system documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation and/or
         operation of security controls.

         (1)    The organization obtains, protects as required, and makes available to authorized personnel,
                vendor/manufacturer documentation that describes the functional properties of the security
                controls employed within the information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
                testing.
         (2)    The organization obtains, protects as required, and makes available to authorized personnel,
                vendor/manufacturer documentation that describes the security-relevant external interfaces to the
                information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing.
         (3)    The organization obtains, protects as required, and makes available to authorized personnel,
                vendor/manufacturer documentation that describes the high-level design of the information system

         Supplemental Guidance: The application of security engineering principles is primarily targeted at
         new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades and is integrated
         into the system development life cycle. For legacy information systems, the organization applies
         security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given
         the current state of the hardware, software, and firmware within the system. Examples of security
         engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing
         sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating
         security into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security
         boundaries; (v) ensuring system developers and integrators are trained on how to develop secure
         software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; and (vii)
         reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

SA-9     EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational
                information security requirements and employ appropriate security controls in accordance
                with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
                and guidance;
         b.     Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
                to external information system services; and
         c.     Monitors security control compliance by external service providers.
         Supplemental Guidance: An external information system service is a service that is implemented
         outside of the authorization boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that
         is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external
         service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures,
         business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., contracts, interagency agreements, lines of
         business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The responsibility
         for adequately mitigating risks arising from the use of external information system services
         remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials require that an appropriate chain of
         trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated
         with information security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that
         the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the
         potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services
         rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the
         relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where a sufficient level of trust
         cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs
         compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk. The external information
         system services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles
         and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the
         expectations of performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes,
         and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization:
                (a)    Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
                       dedicated information security services; and
                (b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
                    approved by [Assignment: organization-defined senior organizational official].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Dedicated information security services include, for
                example, incident monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related
                devices such as firewalls, or key management services.

         a.     Perform configuration management during information system design, development,
                implementation, and operation;
         b.     Manage and control changes to the information system;
         c.     Implement only organization-approved changes;
         d.     Document approved changes to the information system; and
         e.     Track security flaws and flaw resolution.
         Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-3, CM-4, CM-9.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization requires that information system developers/integrators provide an integrity
                check of software to facilitate organizational verification of software integrity after delivery.
         (2)    The organization provides an alternative configuration management process with organizational
                personnel in the absence of dedicated developer/integrator configuration management team.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The configuration management process includes key
                organizational personnel that are responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes
                to the information system, and security personnel that conduct impact analyses prior to the
                implementation of any changes to the system.

SA-11    DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING

         Control: The organization requires that information system developers/integrators, in consultation
         with associated security personnel (including security engineers):
         a.     Create and implement a security test and evaluation plan;
         b.     Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies
                identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
         c.     Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.
         Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security test results are used to the greatest extent feasible
         after verification of the results and recognizing that these results are impacted whenever there have
         been security-relevant modifications to the information system subsequent to developer testing.
         Test results may be used in support of the security authorization process for the delivered
         information system. Related control: CA-2, SI-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization requires that information system developers/integrators employ code analysis
                tools to examine software for common flaws and document the results of the analysis.
         (2)    The organization requires that information system developers/integrators perform a vulnerability
                analysis to document vulnerabilities, exploitation potential, and risk mitigations.
         (3)    The organization requires that information system developers/integrators create a security test and
                evaluation plan and implement the plan under the witness of an independent verification and
                validation agent.

SA-12    SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION

         Control: The organization protects against supply chain threats by employing: [Assignment:
         organization-defined list of measures to protect against supply chain threats] as part of a
         comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.
         Supplemental Guidance: A defense-in-breadth approach helps to protect information systems
         (including the information technology products that compose those systems) throughout the
         system development life cycle (i.e., during design and development, manufacturing, packaging,
         assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). This is
         accomplished by the identification, management, and elimination of vulnerabilities at each phase
         of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to mitigate risk.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization purchases all anticipated information system components and spares in the
                initial acquisition.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Stockpiling information system components and spares
                avoids the need to use less trustworthy secondary or resale markets in future years.
         (2)    The organization conducts a due diligence review of suppliers prior to entering into contractual
                agreements to acquire information system hardware, software, firmware, or services.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews supplier claims with regard to
                the use of appropriate security processes in the development and manufacture of information
                system components or products.
         (3)    The organization uses trusted shipping and warehousing for information systems, information
                system components, and information technology products.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Trusted shipping and warehousing reduces opportunities
                for subversive activities or interception during transit. Examples of supporting techniques
                include the use of a geographically aware beacon to detect shipment diversions or delays.
                Related control: PE-16.
         (4)    The organization employs a diverse set of suppliers for information systems, information system
                components, information technology products, and information system services.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Diversification of suppliers is intended to limit the
                potential harm from a given supplier in a supply chain, increasing the work factor for an
                adversary.
         (5)    The organization employs standard configurations for information systems, information system
                components, and information technology products.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: By avoiding the purchase of custom configurations for
                information systems, information system components, and information technology products,
                the organization limits the possibility of acquiring systems and products that have been
                corrupted via the supply chain actions targeted at the organization.
         (6)    The organization minimizes the time between purchase decisions and delivery of information
                systems, information system components, and information technology products.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: By minimizing the time between purchase decisions and
                required delivery of information systems, information system components, and information
                technology products, the organization limits the opportunity for an adversary to corrupt the
                purchased system, component, or product.
         (7)    The organization employs independent analysis and penetration testing against delivered
                information systems, information system components, and information technology products.

SA-13    TRUSTWORTHINESS

         Control: The organization requires that the information system meets [Assignment: organization-
         defined level of trustworthiness].
         Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to ensure that organizations recognize the
         importance of trustworthiness and making explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing,
         developing, and implementing organizational information systems. Trustworthiness is a
         characteristic or property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system
         can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being
         processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. Trustworthy information systems are systems that
         are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental
         disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified
         environments of operation. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of an information system
         include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features or functions employed within the
         system); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality
         is effective in its application).
         Appropriate security functionality for the information system can be obtained by using the Risk
         Management Framework (Steps 1, 2, and 3) to select and implement the necessary management,
         operational, and technical security controls necessary to mitigate risk to organizational operations
         and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Appropriate security assurance can be
         obtained by: (i) the actions taken by developers and implementers of security controls with regard
         to the design, development, implementation, and operation of those controls; and (ii) the actions
         taken by assessors to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
         operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
         requirements for the information system.
         Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security controls by employing well-
         defined security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software
         development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles. Assurance is also
         based on the assessment of evidence produced during the initiation, acquisition/development,
         implementation, and operations/maintenance phases of the system development life cycle. For
         example, developmental evidence may include the techniques and methods used to design and
         develop security functionality. Operational evidence may include flaw reporting and remediation,
         the results of security incident reporting, and the results of the ongoing monitoring of security
         controls. Independent assessments by qualified assessors may include analyses of the evidence as
         well as testing, inspections, and audits. Minimum assurance requirements are described in
         Appendix E.
         Explicit trustworthiness decisions highlight situations where achieving the information system
         resilience and security capability necessary to withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with
         certain threat capabilities may require adjusting the risk management strategy, the design of
         mission/business processes with regard to automation, the selection and implementation rigor of
         management and operational protections, or the selection of information technology components
         with higher levels of trustworthiness. Trustworthiness may be defined on a component-by-
         component, subsystem-by-subsystem, or function-by-function basis. It is noted, however, that
         typically functions, subsystems, and components are highly interrelated, making separation by
         trustworthiness perhaps problematic and at a minimum, something that likely requires careful
         attention in order to achieve practically useful results. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.

SA-14    CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Determines [Assignment: organization-defined list of critical information system components
                that require re-implementation]; and
         b.     Re-implements or custom develops such information system components.
         Supplemental Guidance: The underlying assumption is that the list of information technology
         products defined by the organization cannot be trusted due to threats from the supply chain that the
         organization finds unacceptable. The organization re-implements or custom develops such
         components to satisfy requirements for high assurance. Related controls: SA-12, SA-13.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization:

                    for the information system components are not compromised.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Measures that the organization considers implementing
                include, for example, enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access,
                and protection from deletion of system and application files.

FAMILY: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION                                               CLASS: TECHNICAL


SC-1     SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented system and communications protection policy that addresses purpose,
                scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
                entities, and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and
                communications protection policy and associated system and communications protection
                controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the system and communications protection family. The policy and procedures are consistent
         with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and communications protection policy
         can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and
         communications protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general and
         for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy
         is a key factor in the development of the system and communications protection policy. Related
         control: PM-9.
         Control Enhancements: None.

SC-2     APPLICATION PARTITIONING

         Control: The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)
         from information system management functionality.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system management functionality includes, for example,
         functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and
         typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information
         system management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using
         different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the operating system,
         different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate. An
         example of this type of separation is observed in web administrative interfaces that use separate
         authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. This may include
         isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and with additional access controls.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related
                functionality at an interface for general (i.e., non-privileged) users.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control enhancement is to ensure that
                administration options are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of the
                grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). For example,
                administration options are not presented until the user has appropriately established a session
                with administrator privileges.

SC-3     SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION

         Control: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.

         Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
         functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains) that
         controls access to and protects the integrity of, the hardware, software, and firmware that perform
         those security functions. The information system maintains a separate execution domain (e.g.,
         address space) for each executing process. Related control: SA-13.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate
                security function isolation.
         (2)    The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control
                from both nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.
         (3)    The organization implements an information system isolation boundary to minimize the number of
                nonsecurity functions included within the boundary containing security functions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Nonsecurity functions contained within the isolation
                boundary are considered security-relevant.
         (4)    The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that avoid
                unnecessary interactions between modules.
         (5)    The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions
                between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or
                correctness of higher layers.

SC-4     INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES

         Control: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via
         shared system resources.
         Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to prevent information, including encrypted
         representations of information, produced by the actions of a prior user/role (or the actions of a
         process acting on behalf of a prior user/role) from being available to any current user/role (or
         current process) that obtains access to a shared system resource (e.g., registers, main memory,
         secondary storage) after that resource has been released back to the information system. Control of
         information in shared resources is also referred to as object reuse. This control does not address:
         (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been in some
         way nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels where shared resources are manipulated to
         achieve a violation of information flow restrictions; or (iii) components in the information system
         for which there is only a single user/role.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system does not share resources that are used to interface with systems
                operating at different security levels.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Shared resources include, for example, memory,
                input/output queues, and network interface cards.

SC-5     DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

         Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
         denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of denial of service
         attacks or reference to source for current list].
         Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
         effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
         types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network from being directly
         affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with
         service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some denial of service attacks. Related
         control: SC-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system restricts the ability of users to launch denial of service attacks against
                other information systems or networks.
         (2)    The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
                effects of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.

SC-6     RESOURCE PRIORITY

         Control: The information system limits the use of resources by priority.

         Supplemental Guidance: Priority protection helps prevent a lower-priority process from delaying or
         interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority process. This control does
         not apply to components in the information system for which there is only a single user/role.

SC-7     BOUNDARY PROTECTION

         Control: The information system:

         a.     Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key
                internal boundaries within the system; and




APPENDIX F-SC                                                                                              PAGE F-108

         b.     Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces
                consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational
                security architecture.
         Supplemental Guidance: Restricting external web traffic only to organizational web servers within
         managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing an internal address
         as the source are examples of restricting and prohibiting communications. Managed interfaces
         employing boundary protection devices include, for example, proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls,
         guards, or encrypted tunnels arranged in an effective security architecture (e.g., routers protecting
         firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a
         demilitarized zone or DMZ).
         The organization considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications
         services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services.
         Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and
         consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include
         third-party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting
         transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
         Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate
         compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. Related controls: AC-4,
         IR-4, SC-5.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization physically allocates publicly accessible information system components to
                separate subnetworks with separate physical network interfaces.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Publicly accessible information system components
                include, for example, public web servers.
         (2)    The information system prevents public access into the organization’s internal networks except as
                appropriately mediated by managed interfaces employing boundary protection devices.
         (3)    The organization limits the number of access points to the information system to allow for more
                comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications and network traffic.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an
                example of limiting the number of managed network access points.
         (4)    The organization:
                (a)   Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;
                (b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
                (c)   Employs security controls as needed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the
                      information being transmitted;
                (d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need
                    and duration of that need;
                (e)   Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
                      and
                (f)   Removes traffic flow policy exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit
                      mission/business need.
         (5)    The information system at managed interfaces, denies network traffic by default and allows
                network traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).
         (6)    The organization prevents the unauthorized release of information outside of the information
                system boundary or any unauthorized communication through the information system boundary
                when there is an operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms.
         (7)    The information system prevents remote devices that have established a non-remote connection
                with the system from communicating outside of that communications path with resources in
                external networks.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is implemented within the
                remote device (e.g., notebook/laptop computer) via configuration settings that are not



APPENDIX F-SC                                                                                               PAGE F-109
Special Publication 800-53          Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                configurable by the user of that device. An example of a non-remote communications path
                from a remote device is a virtual private network. When a non-remote connection is
                established using a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling.
                Split tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information
                system as an extension of that system and to communicate with local resources such as a
                printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote connection,
                becomes an extension of the information system, allowing dual communications paths such as
                split-tunneling would be, in effect, allowing unauthorized external connections into the
                system.
         (8)    The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic]
                to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers
                within the managed interfaces of boundary protection devices.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: External networks are networks outside the control of the
                organization. Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                sessions and blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and
                Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Proxy servers are also configurable with organization-
                defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.
         (9)    The information system, at managed interfaces, denies network traffic and audits internal users (or
                malicious code) posing a threat to external information systems.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Detecting internal actions that may pose a security threat
                to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection. Extrusion detection
                at the information system boundary includes the analysis of network traffic (incoming as well
                as outgoing) looking for indications of an internal threat to the security of external systems.
         (10) The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Measures to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of
                information from the information system include, for example: (i) strict adherence to protocol
                formats; (ii) monitoring for indications of beaconing from the information system; (iii)
                monitoring for use of steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except
                when explicitly needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi)
                employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume or types of traffic
                expected within the organization. Examples of devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol
                formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These
                devices verify adherence to the protocol specification at the application layer and serve to
                identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or
                transport layer.
         (11) The information system checks incoming communications to ensure that the communications are
              coming from an authorized source and routed to an authorized destination.
         (12) The information system implements host-based boundary protection mechanisms for servers,
              workstations, and mobile devices.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: A host-based boundary protection mechanism is, for
                example, a host-based firewall. Host-based boundary protection mechanisms are employed
                on mobile devices, such as notebook/laptop computers, and other types of mobile devices
                where such boundary protection mechanisms are available.
         (13) The organization isolates [Assignment: organization defined key information security tools,
              mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components via
              physically separate subnets with managed interfaces to other portions of the system.
         (14) The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections across the boundary
              protections implemented at [Assignment: organization-defined list of managed interfaces].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information systems operating at different security
                categories may routinely share common physical and environmental controls, since the
                systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these
                separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable
                distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for

                example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection
                frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls
                enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related control: PE-4.
         (15) The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed
              interface for purposes of access control and auditing.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AU-2.
         (16) The information system prevents discovery of specific system components (or devices)
              composing a managed interface.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is intended to protect the
                network addresses of information system components that are part of the managed interface
                from discovery through common tools and techniques used to identify devices on a network.
                The network addresses are not available for discovery (e.g., not published or entered in the
                domain name system), requiring prior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique
                is to periodically change network addresses.
         (17) The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce strict adherence to protocol format.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms used to enforce protocol formats
                include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These devices
                verify adherence to the protocol specification (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and serve to
                identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network
                or transport layer.
         (18) The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary
              protection device.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Fail secure is a condition achieved by the application of a
                set of information system mechanisms to ensure that in the event of an operational failure of a
                boundary protection device at a managed interface (e.g., router, firewall, guard, application
                gateway residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone),
                the system does not enter into an unsecure state where intended security properties no longer
                hold. A failure of a boundary protection device cannot lead to, or cause information external
                to the boundary protection device to enter the device, nor can a failure permit unauthorized
                information release.

         Control: The information system protects the integrity of transmitted information.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to communications across internal and external
         networks. If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for transmission
         services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more difficult to
         obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for
         transmission integrity. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary security
         controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, the
         organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts
         the additional risk. Related controls: AC-17, PE-4.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to recognize changes to information during
                transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.

SC-9     TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY

         Control: The information system protects the confidentiality of transmitted information.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to communications across internal and external
         networks. If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for transmission
         services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more difficult to
         obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for
         transmission confidentiality. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary security

SC-12    CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT

         Control: The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys for required cryptography
         employed within the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using
         manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. In addition to
         being required for the effective operation of a cryptographic mechanism, effective cryptographic
         key management provides protections to maintain the availability of the information in the event
         of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization maintains availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys
                by users.

         Supplemental Guidance: Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white
         boards, cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to
         users when collaborative computing devices are activated.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system provides physical disconnect of collaborative computing devices in a
                manner that supports ease of use.
         (2)    The information system or supporting environment blocks both inbound and outbound traffic
                between instant messaging clients that are independently configured by end users and external
                service providers.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Blocking restrictions do not include instant messaging
                services that are configured by an organization to perform an authorized function.
         (3)    The organization disables or removes collaborative computing devices from information systems
                in [Assignment: organization-defined secure work areas].

SC-17    PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATES

         Control: The organization issues public key certificates under an [Assignment: organization-
         defined certificate policy] or obtains public key certificates under an appropriate certificate policy
         from an approved service provider.
         Supplemental Guidance: For user certificates, each organization attains certificates from an
         approved, shared service provider, as required by OMB policy. For federal agencies operating a
         legacy public key infrastructure cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority at
         medium assurance or higher, this Certification Authority will suffice. This control focuses on
         certificates with a visibility external to the information system and does not include certificates
         related to internal system operations, for example, application-specific time services.

SC-18    MOBILE CODE

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Defines acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies;
         b.     Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for acceptable mobile code and
                mobile code technologies; and
         c.     Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational
         information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used
         maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF,
         Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and
         implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on
         organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.
         Policy and procedures related to mobile code, address preventing the development, acquisition, or
         introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the information system.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system implements detection and inspection mechanisms to identify unauthorized
                mobile code and takes corrective actions, when necessary.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Corrective actions when unauthorized mobile code is
                detected include, for example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrator. Disallowed
                transfers include, for example, sending word processing files with embedded macros.
         (2)    The organization ensures the acquisition, development, and/or use of mobile code to be deployed
                in information systems meets [Assignment: organization-defined mobile code requirements].
         (3)    The information system prevents the download and execution of prohibited mobile code.
         (4)    The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in [Assignment:
                organization-defined software applications] and requires [Assignment: organization-defined
                actions] prior to executing the code.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Actions required before executing mobile code, include,
                for example, prompting users prior to opening electronic mail attachments.

SC-20    SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)

         Control: The information system provides additional data origin and integrity artifacts along with
         the authoritative data the system returns in response to name/address resolution queries.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control enables remote clients to obtain origin authentication and
         integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution
         information obtained through the service. A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of
         an information system that provides name/address resolution service. Digital signatures and
         cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts. DNS resource records are examples of
         authoritative data. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between
         host/service names and network addresses provide other means to assure the authenticity and
         integrity of response data. The DNS security controls are consistent with, and referenced from,
         OMB Memorandum 08-23.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace, provides
                the means to indicate the security status of child subspaces and (if the child supports secure
                resolution services) enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An example means to indicate the security status of child
                subspaces is through the use of delegation signer (DS) resource records in the DNS.

SC-21    SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (RECURSIVE OR CACHING RESOLVER)

         Control: The information system performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification
         on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources when
         requested by client systems.
         Supplemental Guidance: A recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) server is an
         example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service for local clients.
         Authoritative DNS servers are examples of authoritative sources. Information systems that use
         technologies other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses
         provide other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on all
                resolution responses whether or not local clients explicitly request this service.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Local clients include, for example, DNS stub resolvers.

SC-22    ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

         Control: The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an
         organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external role separation.
         Supplemental Guidance: A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information
         system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to
         enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS)
         servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are
         commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located
         in the same physical facility). With regard to role separation, DNS servers with an internal role,
         only process name/address resolution requests from within the organization (i.e., internal clients).
         DNS servers with an external role only process name/address resolution information requests from
         clients external to the organization (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set
         of clients that can access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the
         organization (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).

SC-23    SESSION AUTHENTICITY

         Control: The information system provides mechanisms to protect the authenticity of
         communications sessions.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus
         packet, level. The intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a
         communications session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the
         information being transmitted. For example, this control addresses man-in-the-middle attacks
         including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. This control is only
         implemented where deemed necessary by the organization (e.g., sessions in service-oriented
         architectures providing web-based services).
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session
                termination.
         (2)    The information system provides a readily observable logout capability whenever authentication is
                used to gain access to web pages.
         (3)    The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session and recognizes only
                session identifiers that are system-generated.
         (4)    The information system generates unique session identifiers with [Assignment: organization-
                defined randomness requirements].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Employing the concept of randomness in the generation
                of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future
                session identifiers.

SC-24    FAIL IN KNOWN STATE

         Control: The information system fails to a [Assignment: organization-defined known-state] for
         [Assignment: organization-defined types of failures] preserving [Assignment: organization-defined
         system state information] in failure.
         Supplemental Guidance: Failure in a known state can address safety or security in accordance with
         the mission/business needs of the organization. Failure in a known secure state helps prevent a
         loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system
         or a component of the system. Failure in a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to
         a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving information
         system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the
         organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.

SC-25    THIN NODES

         Control: The information system employs processing components that have minimal functionality
         and information storage.
         Supplemental Guidance: The deployment of information system components with minimal
         functionality (e.g., diskless nodes and thin client technologies) reduces the need to secure every
         user endpoint, and may reduce the exposure of information, information systems, and services to a
         successful attack. Related control: SC-30.

         Control: The information system includes components specifically designed to be the target of
         malicious attacks for the purpose of detecting, deflecting, and analyzing such attacks.
         Supplemental Guidance: None.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system includes components that proactively seek to identify web-based
                malicious code.

SC-27    OPERATING SYSTEM-INDEPENDENT APPLICATIONS

         Control: The information system includes: [Assignment: organization-defined operating system-
         independent applications].
         Supplemental Guidance: Operating system-independent applications are applications that can run on
         multiple operating systems. Such applications promote portability and reconstitution on different
         platform architectures, increasing the availability for critical functionality within an organization
         while information systems with a given operating system are under attack.

SC-28    PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST

         Control: The information system protects the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of
         information at rest in nonmobile devices and covers user information and system information.
         Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage
         device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Configurations
         and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and filtering
         routers and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection.
         Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity
         protections, as appropriate.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
                modification of information at rest unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.

SC-29    HETEROGENEITY

         Control: The organization employs diverse information technologies in the implementation of the
         information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within the information
         system reduces the impact of the exploitation of a specific technology. Organizations that select

         this control should consider that an increase in diversity may add complexity and management
         overhead, both of which have the potential to lead to mistakes and misconfigurations which could
         increase overall risk.

SC-30    VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

         Control: The organization employs virtualization techniques to present information system
         components as other types of components, or components with differing configurations.
         Supplemental Guidance: Virtualization techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise
         information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of
         having multiple platforms.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of
                operating systems and applications that are changed [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: While frequent changes to operating systems and
                applications pose configuration management challenges, the changes result in an increased
                work factor for adversaries in order to carry out successful attacks. Changing the apparent
                operating system or application, as opposed to the actual operating system or application,
                results in virtual changes that still impede attacker success while helping to reduce the
                configuration management effort.
         (2)    The organization employs randomness in the implementation of the virtualization techniques.

SC-31    COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS

         Control: The organization requires that information system developers/integrators perform a covert
         channel analysis to identify those aspects of system communication that are potential avenues for
         covert storage and timing channels.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system developers/integrators are in the best position to
         identify potential avenues within the system that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel
         analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the potential for unauthorized information flows
         across security domains, for example, in the case of information systems containing export-
         controlled information and having connections to external networks (i.e., networks not controlled
         by the organization). Covert channel analysis is also meaningful in the case of multilevel secure
         (MLS) systems, multiple security level (MSL) systems, and cross domain systems.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization tests a subset of the vendor-identified covert channel avenues to determine if
                they are exploitable.

SC-32    INFORMATION SYSTEM PARTITIONING

         Control: The organization partitions the information system into components residing in separate
         physical domains (or environments) as deemed necessary.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection
         strategy. An organizational assessment of risk guides the partitioning of information system
         components into separate physical domains (or environments). The security categorization also
         guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict
         or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned information system
         components. Related controls: AC-4, SC-7.

                and
          b.    Loads and executes [Assignment: organization-defined applications] from hardware-
                enforced, read-only media.
         Supplemental Guidance:  In this control, the term operating environment is defined as the code upon
         which applications are hosted, for example, a monitor, executive, operating system, or application
         running directly on the hardware platform. Hardware-enforced, read-only media include, for

         example, CD-R/DVD-R disk drives. Use of non-modifiable storage ensures the integrity of the
         software program from the point of creation of the read-only image.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
                with no writeable storage that is persistent across component restart or power on/off.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement: (i) eliminates the possibility of
                malicious code insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated information
                system component; and (ii) requires no such removable storage be employed, a requirement
                that may be applied directly or as a specific restriction imposed through AC-19.
         (2)    The organization protects the integrity of the information on read-only media.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement covers protecting the integrity
                of information to be placed onto read-only media and controlling the media after information
                has been recorded onto the media. Protection measures may include, as deemed necessary by
                the organization, a combination of prevention and detection/response. This enhancement may
                be satisfied by requirements imposed by other controls such as AC-3, AC-5, CM-3, CM-5,
                CM-9, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SA-12, SC-28, SI-3, and SI-7.

         Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organization-
         defined frequency]:
         a.     A formal, documented system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope,
                roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities,
                and compliance; and
         b.     Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and
                information integrity policy and associated system and information integrity controls.
         Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are
         required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
         in the system and information integrity family. The policy and procedures are consistent with
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional
         specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and information integrity policy can be
         included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and
         information integrity procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a
         particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a
         key factor in the development of the system and information integrity policy. Related control:

SI-2     FLAW REMEDIATION

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws;
         b.     Tests software updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects
                on organizational information systems before installation; and
         c.     Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.
         Supplemental Guidance: The organization identifies information systems containing software
         affected by recently announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those
         flaws) and reports this information to designated organizational officials with information security
         responsibilities (e.g., senior information security officers, information system security managers,
         information systems security officers). The organization (including any contractor to the
         organization) promptly installs security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs,
         and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident
         response activities, or information system error handling, are also addressed expeditiously.
         Organizations are encouraged to use resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration
         (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws
         discovered in organizational information systems. By requiring that flaw remediation be
         incorporated into the organizational configuration management process, it is the intent of this
         control that required/anticipated remediation actions are tracked and verified. An example of
         expected flaw remediation that would be so verified is whether the procedures contained in US-

         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization centrally manages the flaw remediation process and installs software updates
                automatically.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Due to information system integrity and availability
                concerns, organizations give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out
                automatic updates.
         (2)    The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
                to determine the state of information system components with regard to flaw remediation.
         (3)    The organization measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation, comparing
                with [Assignment: organization-defined benchmarks].

         a.     Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points
                and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network to detect and
                eradicate malicious code:
                - Transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, web accesses, removable
                  media, or other common means; or
                - Inserted through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities;
         b.     Updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including signature definitions) whenever
                new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management
                policy and procedures;

                - Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
                  frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources as the files are downloaded,
                  opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and
                - [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; send alert to
                  administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code
                  detection; and
         d.     Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and
                the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
         electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code
         includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be
         encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed file.
         Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A variety of

         preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software,
         malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example,
         logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions
         and business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms are not built to detect
         such code. In these situations, organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to
         include, for example, secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration
         management and control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
         functions other than those intended. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SI-4, SI-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.
         (2)    The information system automatically updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including
                signature definitions).
         (3)    The information system prevents non-privileged users from circumventing malicious code
                protection capabilities.
         (4)    The information system updates malicious code protection mechanisms only when directed by a
                privileged user.
         (5)    The organization does not allow users to introduce removable media into the information system.
         (6)    The organization tests malicious code protection mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency] by introducing a known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system
                and subsequently verifying that both detection of the test case and associated incident reporting
                occur, as required.

SI-4     INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Monitors events on the information system in accordance with [Assignment: organization-
                defined monitoring objectives] and detects information system attacks;
         b.     Identifies unauthorized use of the information system;
         c.     Deploys monitoring devices: (i) strategically within the information system to collect
                organization-determined essential information; and (ii) at ad hoc locations within the system
                to track specific types of transactions of interest to the organization;
         d.     Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication
                of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or
                the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible
                sources of information; and
         e.     Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance
                with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring.
         External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part
         of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of
         events occurring within the system (e.g., within internal organizational networks and system
         components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and
         techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code
         protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic
         locations for monitoring devices include, for example, at selected perimeter locations and near



APPENDIX F-SI                                                                                               PAGE F-126

         server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the
         managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network monitoring
         device from the Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device.
         The granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its
         monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such activities. An
         example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring
         is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when
         use of such proxies is required. Related controls: AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, SI-3, SI-7.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization interconnects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into a
                systemwide intrusion detection system using common protocols.
         (2)    The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time analysis of events.
         (3)    The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access
                control and flow control mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of
                these mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination.
         (4)    The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications for unusual or
                unauthorized activities or conditions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions include, for
                example, internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code within an information
                system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or
                signaling to an external information system. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify
                potentially compromised information systems or information system components.
         (5)    The information system provides near real-time alerts when the following indications of
                compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined list of compromise
                indicators].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Alerts may be generated, depending on the organization-
                defined list of indicators, from a variety of sources, for example, audit records or input from
                malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion detection or prevention mechanisms, or
                boundary protection devices such as firewalls, gateways, and routers.
         (6)    The information system prevents non-privileged users from circumventing intrusion detection and
                prevention capabilities.
         (7)    The information system notifies [Assignment: organization-defined list of incident response
                personnel (identified by name and/or by role)] of suspicious events and takes [Assignment:
                organization-defined list of least-disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The least-disruptive actions may include initiating a
                request for human response.
         (8)    The organization protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized
                access, modification, and deletion.
         (9)    The organization tests/exercises intrusion-monitoring tools [Assignment: organization-defined
                time-period].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of testing/exercises is dependent upon the
                type and method of deployment of the intrusion-monitoring tools.
         (10) The organization makes provisions so that encrypted traffic is visible to information system
              monitoring tools.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The enhancement recognizes the need to balance
                encrypting traffic versus the need to have insight into that traffic from a monitoring
                perspective. For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of traffic is
                paramount; for others, the mission-assurance concerns are greater.
         (11) The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the system
              (i.e., system perimeter) and, as deemed necessary, at selected interior points within the system
              (e.g., subnets, subsystems) to discover anomalies.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Anomalies within the information system include, for
                example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in
                use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.
         (12) The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following
              inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined
              list of inappropriate or unusual activities that trigger alerts].
         (13) The organization:
                (a)    Analyzes communications traffic/event patterns for the information system;
                (b) Develops profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events; and
                (c)    Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of
                       false positives to [Assignment: organization-defined measure of false positives] and the
                       number of false negatives to [Assignment: organization-defined measure of false negatives].
         (14) The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices
              and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.
         (15) The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
              traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.
         (16) The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
              information system to achieve organization-wide situational awareness.
         (17) The organization correlates results from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to
              achieve integrated situational awareness.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Integrated situational awareness enhances the capability
                of the organization to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the methods
                and techniques employed to carry out the attacks.

SI-5     SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Receives information system security alerts, advisories, and directives from designated
                external organizations on an ongoing basis;
         b.     Generates internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;
         c.     Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to [Assignment: organization-defined
                list of personnel (identified by name and/or by role)]; and
         d.     Implements security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notifies the
                issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.
         Supplemental Guidance: Security alerts and advisories are generated by the United States Computer
         Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to maintain situational awareness across the federal
         government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the
         responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential
         due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse affects
         on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the
         directives not be implemented in a timely manner.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization employs automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information
                available throughout the organization as needed.

SI-6     SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

         Control: The information system verifies the correct operation of security functions [Selection (one
         or more): [Assignment: organization-defined system transitional states]; upon command by user
         with appropriate privilege; periodically every [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]]
         and [Selection (one or more): notifies system administrator; shuts the system down; restarts the
         system; [Assignment: organization-defined alternative action(s)]] when anomalies are discovered.
         Supplemental Guidance: The need to verify security functionality applies to all security functions.
         For those security functions that are not able to execute automated self-tests, the organization
         either implements compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the risk of not performing
         the verification as required. Information system transitional states include, for example, startup,
         restart, shutdown, and abort.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The information system provides notification of failed automated security tests.
         (2)    The information system provides automated support for the management of distributed security
                testing.
         (3)    The organization reports the result of security function verification to designated organizational
                officials with information security responsibilities.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizational officials with information security
                responsibilities include, for example, senior information security officers, information system
                security managers, and information systems security officers.

         information system to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. The
         organization employs good software engineering practices with regard to commercial off-the-shelf
         integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and
         uses tools to automatically monitor the integrity of the information system and the applications it
         hosts.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization reassesses the integrity of software and information by performing [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] integrity scans of the information system.
         (2)    The organization employs automated tools that provide notification to designated individuals upon
                discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.

                revealing [Assignment: organization-defined sensitive or potentially harmful information] in
                error logs and administrative messages that could be exploited by adversaries; and
         c.     Reveals error messages only to authorized personnel.
         Supplemental Guidance: The structure and content of error messages are carefully considered by the
         organization. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error
         conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Sensitive information
         includes, for example, account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

SI-13    PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION

         Control: The organization:

         a.     Protects the information system from harm by considering mean time to failure for
                [Assignment: organization-defined list of information system components] in specific
                environments of operation; and
         b.     Provides substitute information system components, when needed, and a mechanism to
                exchange active and standby roles of the components.
         Supplemental Guidance: While mean time to failure is primarily a reliability issue, this control
         focuses on the potential failure of specific components of the information system that provide
         security capability. Mean time to failure rates are defendable and based on considerations that are
         installation-specific, not industry-average. The transfer of responsibilities between active and
         standby information system components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or
         security (e.g., state variables are preserved). The standby component is available at all times
         except where a failure recovery is in progress or for maintenance reasons. Related control: CP-2.
         Control Enhancements:
         (1)    The organization takes the information system component out of service by transferring
                component responsibilities to a substitute component no later than [Assignment: organization-
                defined fraction or percentage] of mean time to failure.
         (2)    The organization does not allow a process to execute without supervision for more than
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
         (3)    The organization manually initiates a transfer between active and standby information system
                components at least once per [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] if the mean time to
                failure exceeds [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
         (4)    The organization, if an information system component failure is detected:
                (a)    Ensures that the standby information system component successfully and transparently
                       assumes its role within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
                (b) [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm]; automatically
                    shuts down the information system].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Automatic or manual transfer of roles to a standby unit
                may occur upon detection of a component failure.

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS
ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS




T
        he Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires organizations to
        develop and implement an organization-wide information security program to address
        information security for the information and information systems that support the
operations and assets of the organization, including those provided or managed by another
organization, contractor, or other source. The information security program management (PM)
controls described in this appendix complement the security controls in Appendix F and focus on
the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any particular
information system and are essential for managing information security programs. Organizations
specify the individuals within the organization responsible for the development, implementation,
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the information security program management
controls. Organizations document program management controls in the information security
program plan. The organization-wide information security program plan supplements the
individual security plans developed for each organizational information system. Together, the
security plans for the individual information systems and the information security program cover
the totality of security controls employed by the organization.

In addition to documenting the information security program management controls, the security
program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central repository, to document all
security controls from Appendix F that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security
controls inherited by organizational information systems). The information security program
management controls and common controls contained in the information security program plan
are implemented, assessed for effectiveness,74 and authorized by a senior organizational official,
with the same or similar authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization
officials for information systems.75 Plans of action and milestones are developed and maintained
for the program management and common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less
than effective. Information security program management and common controls are also subject
to the same continuous monitoring requirements as security controls employed in individual
organizational information systems.


                                                   Cautionary Note
     Organizations are required to implement security program management controls to provide a foundation
     for the organization’s information security program. The successful implementation of security controls
     for organizational information systems depends on the successful implementation of the organization’s
     program management controls.




74
  Assessment procedures for program management controls and common controls can be found in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.
75
   In situations where common controls are inherited from external environments, organizations should consult the
guidance provided in Section 3.4.



APPENDIX G                                                                                                   PAGE G-1
Special Publication 800-53       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

PM-1     INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN

         Control: The organization:

         a.   Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:
              - Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of the
                security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
                meeting those requirements;
              - Provides sufficient information about the program management controls and common
                controls (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection operations
                either explicitly or by reference) to enable an implementation that is unambiguously
                compliant with the intent of the plan and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the
                plan is implemented as intended;
              - Includes roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
                organizational entities, and compliance;
              - Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being
                incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation),
                organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
         b.   Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organization-
              defined frequency]; and
         c.   Revises the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan
              implementation or security control assessments.
         Supplemental Guidance: The information security program plan can be represented in a single
         document or compilation of documents at the discretion of the organization. The plan documents
         the organization-wide program management controls and organization-defined common controls.
         The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information
         security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed
         within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s
         information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for
         an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system
         providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational
         information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate
         which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
         Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple
         documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are
         included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security
         program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the
         organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,
         authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization
         may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and
         continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family
         when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support
         multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: None.



PM-2     SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER

         Control: The organization appoints a senior information security officer with the mission and
         resources to coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information
         security program.



APPENDIX G                                                                                              PAGE G-2
Special Publication 800-53       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________


         Supplemental Guidance: The security officer described in this control is an organizational official.
         For a federal agency (as defined in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
         or regulations) this official is the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
         also refer to this organizational official as the Senior Information Security Officer or Chief
         Information Security Officer.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: None.



PM-3     INFORMATION SECURITY RESOURCES

         Control: The organization:

         a.   Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to
              implement the information security program and documents all exceptions to this
              requirement;
         b.   Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required; and
         c.   Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned.
         Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board
         (or similar group) to manage and provide oversight for the information security-related aspects of
         the capital planning and investment control process. Related controls: PM-4, SA-2.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: NIST Special Publication 800-65.



PM-4     PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PROCESS

         Control: The organization implements a process for ensuring that plans of action and milestones for
         the security program and the associated organizational information systems are maintained and
         document the remedial information security actions to mitigate risk to organizational operations
         and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
         Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information
         security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. The plan
         of action and milestones updates are based on the findings from security control assessments,
         security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA reporting guidance
         contains instructions regarding organizational plans of action and milestones. Related control:
         CA-5.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: OMB Memorandum 02-01; NIST Special Publication 800-37.



PM-5     INFORMATION SYSTEM INVENTORY

         Control: The organization develops and maintains an inventory of its information systems.

         Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the inventory requirements in FISMA. OMB
         provides guidance on developing information systems inventories and associated reporting
         requirements.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: None.




APPENDIX G                                                                                              PAGE G-3
Special Publication 800-53       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
________________________________________________________________________________________________

PM-6     INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE

         Control: The organization develops, monitors, and reports on the results of information security
         measures of performance.
         Supplemental Guidance: Measures of performance are outcome-based metrics used by an
         organization to measure the effectiveness or efficiency of the information security program and
         the security controls employed in support of the program.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: NIST Special Publication 800-55.



PM-7     ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE

         Control: The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for information
         security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
         organizations, and the Nation.
         Supplemental Guidance: The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with
         the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and
         associated security controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that
         security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle
         and are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s mission/business processes. This also
         embeds into the enterprise architecture, an integral security architecture consistent with
         organizational risk management and information security strategies. Security requirements and
         control integration are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk
         Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment
         Architecture Methodology provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and
         security controls into enterprise architectures. Related controls: PL-2, PM-11, RA-2.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: NIST Special Publication 800-39; Web: WWW.FSAM.GOV.



PM-8     CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN

         Control: The organization addresses information security issues in the development,
         documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.
         Supplemental Guidance: The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure and key
         resources and for preparing an associated critical infrastructure protection plan are found in
         applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
         guidance. Related controls: PM-1, PM-9, PM-11, RA-3.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: HSPD 7.



PM-9     RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

         Control: The organization:

         a.   Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets,
              individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of
              information systems; and
         b.   Implements that strategy consistently across the organization.
         Supplemental Guidance: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an
         unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment



APPENDIX G                                                                                              PAGE G-4

         methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the
         organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk
         over time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide
         application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can
         be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization
         to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive. Related control: RA-3.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: NIST Special Publications 800-30, 800-39.



PM-10    SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS

         Control: The organization:

         a.   Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of organizational information
              systems through security authorization processes;
         b.   Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational
              risk management process; and
         c.   Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk
              management program.
         Supplemental Guidance: The security authorization process for information systems requires the
         implementation of the Risk Management Framework and the employment of associated security
         standards and guidelines. Specific roles within the risk management process include a designated
         authorizing official for each organizational information system. Related control: CA-6.
         Control Enhancements: None.

         References: NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-39.



PM-11    MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION

         Control: The organization:

         a.   Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the
              resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
              organizations, and the Nation; and
         b.   Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes
              and revises the processes as necessary, until an achievable set of protection needs is obtained.
         Supplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required
         capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise
         of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs
         are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business
         processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.
         Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the
         associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an
         organization’s information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that
         could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to
         make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated
         information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with
         organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2.
         Control Enhancements: None.

APPENDIX H

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS
SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS FOR ISO/IEC 27001




T       he mapping tables in this appendix provide organizations with a general indication of
        security control coverage with respect to ISO/IEC 27001, Information technology–Security
        techniques–Information security management systems–Requirements.76 ISO/IEC
27001 applies to all types of organizations (e.g., commercial, government) and specifies
requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and
improving a documented information security management system (ISMS) within the context of
the organization’s overall business risks. While the risk management approach established by
NIST originally focused on managing risk from information systems (as required by FISMA and
described in NIST Special Publication 800-39), the approach is being expanded to include risk
management at the organizational level. A forthcoming version of NIST Special Publication 800-
39 will incorporate ISO/IEC 27001 to manage organizational information security risk through
the establishment of an ISMS. Since NIST’s mission includes the adoption of international and
national standards where appropriate, NIST intends to pursue convergence to reduce the burden
on organizations that must conform to both sets of standards. The convergence initiative will be
carried out in three phases. Phase I, the subject of this appendix, provides a two-way mapping
between the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and the controls in ISO/IEC
27001 (Annex A). Phase II will provide a two-way mapping between the organization-level risk
management concepts in NIST Special Publication 800-39 (forthcoming version) and general
requirements in ISO/IEC 27001. Phase III will use the results from Phase I and II to fully
integrate ISO/IEC 27001 into NIST’s risk management approach such that an organization that
complies with NIST standards and guidelines can also comply with ISO/IEC 27001 (subject to
appropriate assessment requirements for ISO/IEC 27001 certification).

Table H-1 provides a forward mapping from the security controls in NIST Special Publication
800-53 to the controls in ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A). The mappings are created by using the
primary security topic identified in each of the Special Publication 800-53 security controls and
associated control enhancements (if any) and searching for a similar security topic in ISO/IEC
27001 (Annex A). Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the mapping
table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 27001
(Annex A) business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not the same, functionality. In
some cases, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different
context, perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information
flow control broadly in terms of approved authorizations for controlling access between source
and destination objects, whereas ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A) addresses the information flow more
narrowly as it applies to interconnected network domains. Table H-2 provides a reverse mapping
from the security controls in ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A) to the security controls in Special
Publication 800-53.77


76
   ISO/IEC 27001 was published in October 2005 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
77
  The use of the term XX-1 controls in mapping Table H-2 refers to the set of security controls represented by the first
control in each family in NIST Special Publication 800-53, where XX is a placeholder for the two-letter family
identifier. These security controls primarily focus on policies and procedures for each topic area addressed by the
respective security control family.



APPENDIX H                                                                                                      PAGE H-1

Organizations are encouraged to use the mapping tables as a starting point for conducting further
analyses and interpretation of the extent of compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 from compliance
with the NIST security standards and guidelines and visa versa. Organizations that use the
security controls in Special Publication 800-53 as an extension to the security controls in Annex
A in their ISO/IEC 27001 implementations will have a higher probability of complying with
NIST security standards and guidelines than those organizations that use only Annex A.

APPENDIX I

INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE




I
    ndustrial control systems (ICS)78 are information systems that differ significantly from
    traditional administrative, mission support, and scientific data processing information
    systems. ICS typically have many unique characteristics—including a need for real-time
response and extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. These types of
specialized systems are pervasive throughout the critical infrastructure, often being required to
meet several and often conflicting safety, operational, performance, reliability, and security
requirements such as: (i) minimizing risk to the health and safety of the public; (ii) preventing
serious damage to the environment; (iii) preventing serious production stoppages or slowdowns
that result in negative impact to the Nation’s economy and ability to carry out critical functions;
(iv) protecting the critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and common human error; and (v)
safeguarding against the compromise of proprietary information.79

Previously, ICS had little resemblance to traditional information systems in that they were
isolated systems running proprietary software and control protocols. However, as these systems
have been increasingly integrated more closely into mainstream organizational information
systems to promote connectivity, efficiency, and remote access capabilities, portions of these ICS
have started to resemble the more traditional information systems. Increasingly, ICS use the
same commercially available hardware and software components as are used in the organization’s
traditional information systems. While the change in ICS architecture supports new information
system capabilities, it also provides significantly less isolation from the outside world for these
systems, introducing many of the same vulnerabilities that exist in current networked information
systems. The result is an even greater need to secure ICS.

FIPS 200, supported by NIST Special Publication 800-53, requires that federal agencies (and
organizations subordinate to those agencies) implement minimum security controls for their
organizational information systems based on the FIPS 199 security categorization of those
systems. This includes implementing the baseline security controls described in this document in
ICS that are operated by or on behalf of federal agencies. Section 3.3, Tailoring the Initial
Baseline, allows organizations80 to modify or adjust recommended security control baselines
when certain conditions exist that require that flexibility. NIST recommends that ICS owners
take advantage of the ability to tailor the initial baselines applying the ICS-specific guidance in
this appendix. This appendix also contains additions to the initial security control baselines that
have been determined to be generally required for ICS.




78
  An ICS is an information system used to control industrial processes such as manufacturing, product handling,
production, and distribution. Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICS are typically found in the
electric, water, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing
(automotive, aerospace, and durable goods) industries as well as in air and rail transportation control systems.

     See Executive Order 13231 on Critical Infrastructure Protection, October 16, 2001.

  NIST Special Publication 800-53 employs the term organization to refer to the owner or operator of an information
system. In this Appendix, organization may refer to the owner or operator of an ICS.



APPENDIX I                                                                                                    PAGE I-1

NIST has worked cooperatively with ICS communities in the public and private sectors to
develop specific guidance on the application of the security controls in this document to ICS.
That guidance, contained in this Appendix, includes ICS-specific:
•     Tailoring guidance;
•     Supplements to the security control baselines; and
•     Supplemental guidance.

ICS Tailoring Guidance
Tailoring guidance for ICS can include scoping guidance and the application of compensating
security controls. Due to the unique characteristics of ICS, these systems may require a greater
use of compensating security controls than is the case for general-purpose information systems.


                                             Implementation Tip
    In situations where the ICS cannot support, or the organization determines it is not advisable to
    implement particular security controls or control enhancements in an ICS (e.g., performance, safety,
    or reliability are adversely impacted), the organization provides a complete and convincing rationale
    for how the selected compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of
    protection for the ICS and why the related baseline security controls could not be employed.
    In accordance with the Technology-related Considerations of the Scoping Guidance in Section 3.3, if
    automated mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or technically feasible in the ICS,
    compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures are
    employed.
    Compensating controls are not exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are
    alternative safeguards and countermeasures employed within the ICS that accomplish the intent of
    the original security controls that could not be effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the
    use of compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the ICS.


The security controls and control enhancements listed in Table I-1 are likely candidates for
tailoring with the applicability of scoping guidance indicated for each control/enhancement. In
Table I-1, the citation of a control without enhancements (e.g., AC-17) refers only to the base
control without any enhancements, while reference to an enhancement by a parenthetical number
following the control identification (e.g., AC-17(1)) refers only to the specific control
enhancement.

In addition to the security controls added for ICS in the table above, the security control
supplement process described in Section 3.4 is still applicable to ICS. Organizations are required
to conduct a risk assessment taking into account the tailoring and supplementing performed in
arriving at the agreed-upon set of security controls for the ICS and the risk to the organization’s
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation being incurred by
operation of the ICS with the intended controls. The organization decides whether that risk is
acceptable, and if not, supplements the control set with additional controls until an acceptable
level of risk is obtained.

ICS Supplemental Guidance

ICS Supplemental Guidance provides organizations with additional information on the
application of the security controls and control enhancements in Appendix F to ICS and the
environments in which these specialized systems operate. The Supplemental Guidance also
provides information as to why a particular security control or control enhancement may not be
applicable in some ICS environments and may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of
scoping guidance and/or compensating controls). ICS Supplemental Guidance does not replace
the original Supplemental Guidance in Appendix F.

ACCESS CONTROL


AC-2     ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where physical access to the ICS (e.g., workstations,
         hardware components, field devices) predefines account privileges or where the ICS (e.g., certain
         remote terminal units, meters, relays) cannot support account management, the organization
         employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel
         security, intrusion detection, auditing measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
         Control Enhancement: (1)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS (e.g., field devices) cannot
         support the use of automated mechanisms for the management of information system accounts, the
         organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
         accordance with the general tailoring guidance.


AC-3     ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that access enforcement mechanisms do not
         adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS.
         References: NIST Special Publication 800-82.



AC-5     SEPARATION OF DUTIES

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the differentiation of roles,
         the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased personnel
         security and auditing) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. The organization
         carefully considers the appropriateness of a single individual performing multiple critical roles.


AC-6     LEAST PRIVILEGE

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support differentiation of privileges,
         the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased personnel
         security and auditing) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. The organization
         carefully considers the appropriateness of a single individual having multiple critical privileges.


AC-7     UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support account/node locking or
         delayed login attempts, or the ICS cannot perform account/node locking or delayed logins due to
         significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs
         appropriate compensating controls (e.g., logging or recording all unsuccessful login attempts and
         alerting ICS security personnel though alarms or other means when the number of organization-
         defined consecutive invalid access attempts is exceeded) in accordance with the general tailoring

AC-10    CONCURRENT SESSION CONTROL

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support concurrent session control,
         the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased auditing
         measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.


AC-11    SESSION LOCK

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: The ICS employs session lock to prevent access to specified
         workstations/nodes. The ICS activates session lock mechanisms automatically after an
         organization-defined time period for designated workstations/nodes on the ICS. In some cases,
         session lock for ICS operator workstations/nodes is not advised (e.g., when immediate operator
         responses are required in emergency situations). Session lock is not a substitute for logging out of
         the ICS. In situations where the ICS cannot support session lock, the organization employs
         appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel security,
         and auditing measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

         Control Enhancement: (1)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
         automated mechanisms for monitoring and control of remote access methods, the organization
         employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls (e.g., following
         manual authentication [see IA-2 in this appendix], dial-in remote access may be enabled for a
         specified period of time or a call may be placed from the ICS site to the authenticated remote
         entity) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
         Control Enhancement: (2)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: ICS security objectives typically follow the priority of
         availability, integrity and confidentiality, in that order. The use of cryptography is determined
         after careful consideration of the security needs and the potential ramifications on system
         performance. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the use of
         cryptography would adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS. The organization
         explores all possible cryptographic mechanism (e.g., encryption, digital signature, hash function).
         Each mechanism has a different delay impact. In situations where the ICS cannot support the use
         of cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote sessions, or the
         components cannot use cryptographic mechanisms due to significant adverse impact on safety,
         performance, or reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g.,
         providing increased auditing for remote sessions or limiting remote access privileges to key
         personnel) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

         guidance.


SECURITY ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION


CA-2     SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: Assessments are performed and documented by qualified assessors
         (i.e., experienced in assessing ICS) authorized by the organization. The organization ensures that
         assessments do not interfere with ICS functions. The individual/group conducting the assessment
         fully understands the organizational information security policies and procedures, the ICS security
         policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a
         particular facility and/or process. A production ICS may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to
         the extent feasible, before an assessment can be conducted. If an ICS must be taken off-line to
         conduct an assessment, the assessment is scheduled to occur during planned ICS outages
         whenever possible. In situations where the organization cannot, for operational reasons, conduct a
         live assessment of a production ICS, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g.,
         providing a replicated system to conduct the assessment) in accordance with the general tailoring
         guidance.


CA-7     CONTINUOUS MONITORING

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: Assessments are performed and documented by qualified assessors
         (i.e., experienced in assessing ICS) authorized by the organization. The organization ensures that

CP-4     CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING AND EXERCISES

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the organization cannot test or exercise the
         contingency plan on production ICS due to significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or
         reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., using scheduled and
         unscheduled system maintenance activities including responding to ICS component and system
         failures, as an opportunity to test or exercise the contingency plan) in accordance with the general
         tailoring guidance.


CP-10    INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: Reconstitution of the ICS includes restoration of system state variables
         (e.g., valves are restored to their appropriate settings as part of the reconstitution).


IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION


IA-2     USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: Where users function as a single group (e.g., control room operators),
         user identification and authentication may be role-based, group-based, or device-based. For
         certain ICS, the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions
         for ICS are not hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these
         systems may be restricted by appropriate physical security controls. In situations where the ICS
         cannot support user identification and authentication, or the organization determines it is not
         advisable to perform user identification and authentication due to significant adverse impact on
         performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls
         (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing measures) in
         accordance with the general tailoring guidance. For example, manual voice authentication of
         remote personnel and local, manual actions may be required in order to establish a remote access.
         See AC-17 ICS Supplemental Guidance in this appendix. Local user access to ICS components is
         enabled only when necessary, approved, and authenticated.
         Control Enhancements: (1) (2) (3)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support multifactor

SI-3     MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: The use of malicious code protection is determined after careful
         consideration and after verification that it does not adversely impact the operational performance
         of the ICS.
         Control Enhancement: (1)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the organization cannot centrally
         manage malicious code protection mechanisms, the organization employs appropriate
         compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
         Control Enhancement: (2)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
         automated mechanisms to update malicious code protection mechanisms, the organization
         employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with
         the general tailoring guidance.
         References: NIST Special Publication 800-82.



SI-4     INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING

         ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that the use of monitoring tools and
         techniques does not adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS.
         Control Enhancement: (2)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
         automated tools to support near-real-time analysis of events, the organization employs
         nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general
         tailoring guidance.
         Control Enhancement: (6)

         ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot prevent non-privileged
         users from circumventing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, the organization
         employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., enhanced auditing) in accordance with the
         general tailoring guidance.
