  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a unique responsibility for computer
systems technology within the Federal Government. NIST's National Computer Systems Laboratory
(NCSL) develops standards and guidelines, provides technical assistance, and conducts research for comput-
ers and related telecommunications systems to achieve more effective utilization of Federal information
technology resources. NCSL's responsibilities include development of technical, management, physical, and
administrative standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive unclassified
information processed in Federal computers. NCSL assists agencies in developing security plans and in
improving computer security awareness training. This Special Publication 800 series reports NCSL research
and guidelines to Federal agencies as well as to organizations in industry, government, and academia.

                                                INTRODUCTION

          In recognition       of theneed for better dissemination of computer security
                                          critical

information throughout government and industry, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) has produced this selected bibliography of key computer security literature
published from January 1980 through October 1989. This bibHography was compiled by Rein
Turn of Rein Turn Associates under contract to NIST.

          The bibliography is organized into the following 10 sections and 2 appendices:

                   1.   General
                  2.    Management
                  3. Foundations
                  4. Access Control
                  5. Trusted Systems
                  6. Database Security
                  7. Communication and Network Security
                  8. Cryptography

                  9. Privacy
                 10. Pre- 1980 Publications
                 Appendix A: Periodicals
                 Appendix B: List of Key Words



        Citations in sections 1 through 9 are organized by subject matter; section 10 is a listing
of pre- 1980 publications. To have been selected, an article had to be substantial in content and
have been published in professional or technical journals, magazines, or conference
proceedings. Only very substantial articles from the popular or trade press were included.
EngHsh language articles from foreign journals were included as available.

          The individual citations have the following        structure (an     example       is   shown at the
right):

       Each citation is uniquely identified by the first letters of the principal author's last
name                      organization's acronym, if no author is identified or listing by
          (or the publishing
organization is more meaningful) and the last two digits of the year of publication. A
lowercase letter following the year serves to distinguish otherwise identical citation identifiers.



                                                      1
Section numbers are used to distinguish identical citations identifiers from different sections
and multiple citations from the same publication [e.g. (2: NBS-81) and (7: NBS-81)],

        Appendix A contains a list of the periodicals from which citations in this bibliography
have been taken. The list contains publisher and editor information where appropriate in order
to assist the user of this bibliography to obtain more information about documents cited.


        Appendix B contains a list of all the key words used in each of the 10 sections. This
list                      who would like information on a topic that spans more than one
       will assist the reader
section. As  an example, information   on viruses can been found in each of the first three
sections (General, Management, and Foundations).

          This section cites general, mostly nontechnical publications on computer threats and
vulnerabilities (including the hacker and computer viruses), the need for computer security, and
other aspects of computer security.

Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Reports NIST research
and development in those disciplines of the physical and engineering sciences in which the Institute
is active. These include physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences.
Papers cover a broad range of subjects, with major emphasis on measurement methodology and
the basic technology underlying standardization. Also included from time to time are survey articles
on topics closely related to the Institute's technical and scientific programs. Issued six times a year.


Nonperiodicals

Monographs  — Major contributions to the technical literature on various subjects related to the
Institute's scientific and technical activities.
Handbooks — Recommended codes of engineering and industrial practice (including safety codes) de-
veloped in cooperation with interested industries, professional organizations, and regulatory bodies.
Special Publications — Include proceedings of conferences sponsored by NIST, NIST annual reports,
and other special publications appropriate to this grouping such as wall charts, pocket cards, and
bibliographies.
Applied Mathematics Series    —Mathematical tables, manuals, and studies of special interest to physi-
cists,engineers, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, computer programmers, and others engaged in
scientific and technical work.
                                            —
National Standard Reference Data Series Provides quantitative data on the physical and chemical
properties of materials, compiled from the world's literature and critically evaluated. Developed un-
der a worldwide program coordinated by NIST under the authority of the National Standard Data
Act (Public Law 90-396). NOTE: The Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data (JPCRD)
is published quarterly for NIST by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Insti-
tute of Physics (AIP). Subscriptions, reprints, and supplements are available from ACS, 1155 Six-
teenth St., NW., Washington,        DC
                                    20056.
                          —
Building Science Series Disseminates technical information developed at the Institute on building
materials, components, systems, and whole structures. The series presents research results, test
methods, and performance criteria related to the structural and environmental functions and the
durability and safety characteristics of building elements and systems.
                 —
Technical Notes Studies or reports which are complete in themselves but restrictive in their treat-
ment of a subject. Analogous to monographs but not so comprehensive in scope or definitive in
treatment of the subject area. Often serve as a vehicle for final reports of work performed at NIST
under the sponsorship of other government agencies.
                                —
Voluntary Product Standards Developed under procedures published by the Department of Com-
merce in Part 10, Title 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. The standards establish nationally
recognized requirements for products, and provide all concerned interests with a basis for common
understanding of the characteristics of the products. NIST administers this program as a supplement
to the activities of the private sector standardizing organizations.
                                —
Consumer Information Series Practical information, based on NIST research and experience, cov-
ering areas of interest to the consumer. Easily understandable language and illustrations provide use-
ful background knowledge for shopping in today's technological marketplace.
Order the above NIST publications from: Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington,   DC   20402.
Order the following NIST publications—FIPS and NISTIRs—from the National Technical Information
Service, Springfield,   VA 22161.
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUB)— Publications in 'this series col-
lectively constitute the Federal Information Processing Standards Register. The Register serves as
the official source of information in the Federal Government regarding standards issued by NIST
pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended, Public Law
89-306 (79 Stat. 1127), and as implemented by Executive Order 11717 (38 FR 12315, dated May 11,
1973) and Part 6 of Title 15 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).

by NIST for outside sponsors (both government and non-govemment). In general, initial distribu-
tion is handled by the sponsor; public distribution is by the National Technical Information Service,
Springfield,  VA  22161, in paper copy or microfiche form.
