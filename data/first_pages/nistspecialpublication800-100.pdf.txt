The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for
the Nation's measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods,
reference data, proof-of-concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL's responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines
for the cost-effective security and privacy of nonnational-security-related information in federal
information systems. This Special Publication 800 series reports on ITL's research, guidelines,
and outreach efforts in information system security and its collaborative activities with industry,
government, and academic organizations.

Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
and for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright regulations.

Chapter 1
1. Introduction
    This Information Security Handbook provides a broad overview of information
security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish and
implement an information security program. Typically, the organization looks to the
program for overall responsibility to ensure the selection and implementation of
appropriate security controls and to demonstrate the effectiveness of satisfying their
stated security requirements. The topics within this document were selected based
on the laws and regulations relevant to information security, including the Clinger-
Cohen Act of 1996, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of
2002, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. The material in
this handbook can be referenced for general information on a particular topic or can
be used in the decision-making process for developing an information security
program. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISTIR) Interagency
Report 7298 provides a summary glossary for the basic security terms used
throughout this document. While reading this handbook, please consider that the
guidance is not specific to a particular agency. Agencies should tailor this guidance
according to their security posture and business requirements.

1.1    Purpose and Applicability
    The purpose of this publication is to inform members of the information security
management team (agency heads; chief information officers [CIOs]; senior agency
information security officers [SAISOs], also commonly referred to as Chief
Information Security Officers [CISOs]; and security managers) about various aspects
of information security that they will be expected to implement and oversee in their
respective organizations. In addition, the handbook provides guidance for facilitating
a more consistent approach to information security programs across the federal
government. Even though the terminology in this document is geared toward the
federal sector, the handbook can also be used to provide guidance on a variety of
other governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements.

1.2    Relationship to Existing Guidance
   This handbook summarizes and augments a number of existing NIST standards
and guidance documents and provides additional information on related topics. Such
documents are referenced within appropriate subchapters.

1.3    Audience
    The intended audience includes agency heads, CIOs, SAISOs (also commonly
referred to as CISOs), and security managers. The handbook provides information
that the audience can use in building their information security program strategy.
While there are differences between federal and private sector environments,
especially in terms of priorities and legal requirements, the underlying principles of
information security are the same. The handbook is therefore useful to any manager
who requires a broad overview of information security practices.

Chapter 2
2. Information Security Governance
    Federal agencies rely heavily on information technology (IT) to run their daily
operations and deliver products and services. With an increasing reliability on IT, a
growing complexity of federal government IT infrastructure, and a constantly
changing information security threat and risk environment, information security has
become a mission-essential function. This function must be managed and governed
to reduce the risks to federal government operations and to ensure the federal
government’s ability to do business and serve the American public.
    The purpose of information security governance is to ensure that agencies are
proactively implementing appropriate information security controls to support their
mission in a cost-effective manner, while managing evolving information security
risks. As such, information security governance has its own set of requirements,
challenges, activities, and types of possible structures. Information security
governance also has a defining role in identifying key information security roles and
responsibilities, and it influences information security policy development and
oversight and ongoing monitoring activities.
   To ensure an appropriate level of support of agency missions and the proper
implementation of current and future information security requirements, each agency
should establish a formal information security governance structure.
   Information security governance can be defined as the process of establishing
   and maintaining a framework and supporting management structure and
   processes to provide assurance that information security strategies are aligned
   with and support business objectives, are consistent with applicable laws and
   regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provide
   assignment of responsibility, all in an effort to manage risk.

2.1 Information Security Governance Requirements
    The United States (U.S.) Congress and the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) have instituted a number of laws, regulations, and directives that govern
establishment and implementation of federal information security practices. These
laws, regulations, and directives establish federal- and agency-level responsibilities
for information security, define key information security roles and responsibilities,
identify minimum information security controls, specify compliance reporting rules
and procedures, and provide other essential requirements and guidance. These laws
and regulations place responsibility and accountability for information security at all
levels within federal agencies, from the agency head to IT users. They also provide
an infrastructure for developing and promulgating detailed standards and
implementation guidance to federal agencies and overseeing implementation of
required practices through NIST and the Government Accountability Office (GAO),
respectively.
    These three entities, the U.S. Congress, OMB, and GAO, define and influence
federal agency governance and information security requirements. Congress creates
laws and oversight measures to establish objectives, present timely analyses to
establish overall governance standards across the federal government, and provide
aid in economic and budget decisions, including decisions about public IT assets and


                                                                                        2
CHAPTER 2                                                Information Security Governance


those funds needed to secure them. Agencies must establish clear reporting
requirements that meet legislative requirements set by Congress and must also
provide Congress with the necessary information and estimates required for the
congressional budget process. OMB assists the President in overseeing the
preparation of the federal budget and supervises its administration by the executive
branch agencies. OMB provides further guidance to the agencies on implementing
legislative information requirements in the form of circulars and memoranda. GAO
also provides oversight of agency information security activities as a part of its
mission “to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to
help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal
government for the benefit of the American people.” 1 GAO reviews agency
implementation of legislative and regulatory requirements and reports to Congress
and the American public on its findings.
    At a minimum, information security governance in a federal department or
agency must meet the requirements as they are detailed in applicable legislation,
regulations, and directives. Furthermore, agencies can benefit from identifying
overall good governance practices for establishing strong management and
oversight. Agencies should tailor their information security governance practices to
their organization’s own missions, operations, and needs.
   The following are a few key legislative acts that define overall federal agency
governance requirements:
      • The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 establishes the
        foundation for budget decision making to achieve strategic goals in order to
        meet agency mission objectives.
      • The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 requires agencies to perform their
        information resource management activities in an efficient, effective, and
        economical manner.
      • The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996 requires
        accountability of financial and program managers for financial results of actions
        taken, control over the federal government's financial resources, and protection
        of federal assets.
      • The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 requires ongoing
        evaluations and reports from each executive on the adequacy of administrative
        control for internal accounting systems.
      • The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agencies to use a disciplined capital
        planning and investment control (CPIC) process to acquire, use, maintain, and
        dispose of IT resources, and establishes a role of chief information officer (CIO)
        within each federal agency.
      • The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347) promotes better use of
        the Internet and other IT resources to improve government services for citizens
        and internal government operations, and provide opportunities for citizen
        participation in government. The Act also requires agencies to:
        – Comply with FISMA, included as Title III of the E-Government Act;
        – Support governmentwide e-government initiatives;
        – Leverage cross-agency opportunities to further e-government through the
          Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) initiative; and

      – Conduct and submit to OMB privacy impact assessments for all new IT
        investments administering information in identifiable form collected from or
        about members of the public.
   Supporting these acts, three legislative documents emerge as the foundational
sources for specific information security governance requirements:
    • The Federal Information Security Management (FISMA) Act is the primary
      legislation governing federal information security programs, building upon
      earlier legislation through added emphasis on the management dimension of
      information security.
      – FISMA delegates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
        (NIST) the responsibility to develop detailed information security standards
        and guidance for federal information systems, with the exception of national
        security systems.
      – FISMA designates to OMB the oversight of federal agencies’ information
        security implementation.
      – FISMA provides a comprehensive framework for securing federal government
        IT resources, including defining key federal government and agency roles
        and responsibilities, requiring agencies to integrate information security into
        their capital planning and enterprise architecture processes, requiring
        agencies to conduct annual information security reviews of all programs and
        systems, and reporting the results of those reviews to OMB. 2
    • OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix
      III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, establishes a
      minimum set of controls to be included in federal automated information
      security programs, assigns federal agency responsibilities for the security of
      automated information, and links agency automated information security
      programs and agency management control systems. 3
    • Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), released in August
      2004, specifies a "policy for a common identification standard for all Federal
      employees and contractors." 4 HSPD-12 intends to increase identification
      security and interoperability by standardizing the process to issue a Federal
      employee or contractor an identification credential, and also by specifying the
      electronic and physical properties of the credential itself. The HSPD-12
      credential is known as the Personal Identity Verification card.
   Figure 2-1 illustrates key roles of legislative, regulatory, and oversight bodies in
establishing governance and information security governance requirements for the
federal enterprise.

              Figure 2-1. Key Legislative, Regulatory, and Oversight Roles


    The need to identify and implement appropriate federal government and agency-
specific information security governance practices can be daunting. Agencies should
identify applicable requirements based on relevant legislation, regulations, federal
directives, and agency-level directives. Agencies should also ensure that information
security governance structures are implemented in a manner that best supports their
unique missions and operations.

2.2 Information Security Governance Components
    Agencies should integrate their information security governance activities with
the overall agency structure and activities by ensuring appropriate participation of
agency officials in overseeing implementation of information security controls
throughout the agency. The key activities that facilitate such integration are
strategic planning, organizational design and development, establishment of roles
and responsibilities, integration with the enterprise architecture, and documentation
of security objectives in policies and guidance. Figure 2-2 illustrates the relative
relationship of these various components.

2.2.1 Information Security Strategic Planning
      “Strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual program performance
      reports are the main elements of GPRA. Together these elements create a
      recurring cycle of reporting, planning, and execution.” 5
    GPRA requires federal agencies to develop and submit to OMB and Congress a
“strategic plan for program activities” and “prepare an annual performance plan
covering each program activity set forth in the budget of such agency.“6 Agencies
are required to refresh their strategic plans within three years of submitting their
previous strategic plans, while submitting performance plans is required annually.
    Agencies should integrate information security into the agency strategic planning
processes by establishing and documenting information security strategies that
directly support agency strategic and performance planning activities. The
organization’s information security strategy should establish a comprehensive
framework to enable the development, institutionalization, assessment, and
improvement of the agency’s information security program. The information security
strategy should support the overall agency strategic and performance plans and IT
strategic plan (if applicable) with its content clearly traceable to these higher-level
sources. Each agency should define the following for its information security
program:

CHAPTER 2                                         Information Security Governance


   • Clear and comprehensive mission, vision, goals, and objectives and how they
     relate to agency mission;
   • High-level plan for achieving information security goals and objectives,
     including short- and mid-term objectives and performance targets, specific for
     each goal and objective, to be used throughout the life of this plan to manage
     progress toward successfully fulfilling the identified objectives; and
   • Performance measures to continuously monitor accomplishment of identified
     goals and objectives and their progress toward stated targets.
    Agencies should document their information security strategy in an information
security strategic plan or another document, if appropriate. Regardless of how the
information security strategy is documented, its contents should be aligned with the
overall agency strategic planning activities. The document should be revisited when a
major change in the agency information security environment occurs, including:
   • Change in applicable legislation, regulations, or directives;
   • Change in agency mission priorities; and
   • Emerging information security issues, such as changes in threat and
     vulnerability environment or the introduction of new technologies.

2.2.2 Information Security Governance Structures
   Information security governance structures can be characterized in a number of
ways. There are two basic models of information security governance structures:
centralized and decentralized. While agency heads are ultimately responsible for
managing and governing their respective agency, the authority and responsibility
over information security differs in the two types of structures. Key characteristics of
the two structures are:
   • Centralized. Departmental CIO or, in some instances, the SAISO has line-item
     budget control over all information security activities throughout the
     department. All information security practitioners within the department report
     to the departmental SAISO, who is responsible for ensuring implementation
     and monitoring of information security controls throughout the entire
     department.
   • Decentralized. Departmental SAISOs have policy development and oversight
     responsibilities. Departmental SAISOs have budget responsibilities over the
     departmental information security program, but not over the operating units’
     information security programs. Operating unit SAISOs report to the unit head,
     not to the departmental SAISO. Operating unit SAISOs are responsible for
     implementing and monitoring information security practices within their
     respective operating units.
    Completely centralized or decentralized information security governance
implementations are quite rare. In reality, the variety of implemented information
security governance structures spans the continuum from a centralized structure at
one end to a decentralized structure at the other. Agencies usually adopt hybrid
structures that include some characteristics of both centralized and decentralized
types of structures, and they adopt the particular mix of these characteristics to fit
their agency mission, size, homogeneity of their components, and existing
governance structure.




                                                                                         7
CHAPTER 2                                                      Information Security Governance


    Agencies in the process of establishing or changing their information security
governance structure should consider the following key factors to determine the
optimal extent of the centralization or decentralization:
      • Agency size;
      • Agency mission and its level of diversification or homogeneity;
      • Existing agency IT infrastructure;
      • Existing federal and internal governance requirements;
      • Size of agency budget;
      • Agency information security capabilities;
      • Number of, and distance between, physical locations; and
      • Decision-making practices and desired rate of change in information security
        practices.
    To the degree that these factors are limited or varied, an organization’s hybrid
information security governance structure will fall somewhere between the extremes
of a completely centralized or decentralized structure, as depicted in Figure 2-3. An
organization’s placement on this continuum may also shift over time in response to
changing internal factors or external requirements.
    Since information security governance structure is highly dependent on the
overall organizational structure, organizations are often limited in their choices about
how to organize their information security governance activities. Agencies should be
cognizant of the characteristics and challenges that a centralized or decentralized
structure presents and work within their respective organizations to ensure the best
use of information security resources within the boundaries of their own structure.

2.2.3 Key Governance Roles and Responsibilities 7
    There are several governance stakeholders common to most organizations that
span the organization. These stakeholders include senior leadership, a CIO,
information security personnel, and a chief financial officer (CFO), among others. The
specific requirements of each role may differ with the degree of information security
governance centralization or in response to the specific missions and needs of an
organization.

2.2.3.1 Agency Head
    The Clinger-Cohen Act assigns the responsibility for ensuring “that the
information security policies, procedures, and practices of the executive agency are
adequate.” 8 FISMA provides the following details on agency head responsibilities for
information security:
       • Providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and
         magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
         disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained
         by or on behalf of an agency, and on information systems used or operated by
         an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an
         agency;
       • Ensuring that an information security program is developed, documented, and
         implemented to provide security for all systems, networks, and data that
         support the operations of the organization;
       • Ensuring that information security processes are integrated with strategic and
         operational planning processes to secure the organization’s mission;
       • Ensuring that senior agency officials within the organization are given the
         necessary authority to secure the operations and assets under their control;

       • Developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program;
       • Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and
         control techniques to address all applicable requirements;
       • Ensuring compliance with applicable information security requirements; and
       • Reporting annually, in coordination with the other senior agency officials, to the
         agency head on the effectiveness of the agency information security program,
         including progress of remedial actions.

2.2.3.3 Senior Agency Information Security Officer 9
       FISMA assigns SAISO the following responsibilities:
       • Performing information security duties as the primary duty;

   • Ensuring preparation and maintenance of plans and procedures to provide
     continuity of operations for information systems that support the operations
     and assets of the agency; and
   • Supporting the agency CIO in annual reporting to the agency head on the
     effectiveness of the agency information security program, including progress of
     remedial actions.

2.2.3.4 Chief Enterprise Architect
   The chief enterprise architect or comparable position in an organization is
responsible for:
   • Leading agency enterprise architecture development and implementation
     efforts;
   • Collaborating with lines of business within the agency to ensure proper
     integration of lines of business into enterprise architecture;
   • Participating in agency strategic planning and performance planning activities to
     ensure proper integration of enterprise architecture;
   • Facilitating integration of information security into all layers of enterprise
     architecture to ensure agency implementation of secure solutions; and

     architecture requirements are adequately addressed by applying FEA and the
     Security and Privacy Profile (SPP).

2.2.3.5 Related Roles
    Many other individuals within an organization have a stake in information
security, from top senior management down to individual users. A few of the
primary senior management roles and their coinciding responsibilities are listed
below. The scope of each role will depend on whether or not these roles should be
redundant in the decentralized governance structure. These individuals should work
collaboratively to ensure that information security exists within their organizational
responsibility.
    Inspector General (IG). The IG is a statutory office within an organization that,
in addition to other responsibilities, works to assess an organization’s information
security practices and identifies vulnerabilities and the possible need to modify
security measures. The IG completes this task by:
   • Detecting fraud or instances of waste, abuse, or misuse of an organization’s
     funds;
   • Identifying operational deficiencies within the organization;
   • Ensuring that the underlying problems that permit such failings are rectified;
     and
   • Offering recommendations for preventing problems in the future.
    Chief Financial Officer. The CFO is the senior financial advisor to the
investment review board (IRB) and the agency head. Information security
investments fall within the purview of the CFO and are included in the CFO’s reports.
In this capacity, the CFO is responsible for:
   • Reviewing cost goals of each major information security investment;
   • Reporting financial management information to OMB as part of the President’s
     budget;
   • Complying with legislative and OMB-defined responsibilities as they relate to IT
     capital investments;
   • Reviewing systems that impact financial management activities; and
   • Forwarding investment assessments to the IRB.
    Chief Privacy Officer or other designated official with privacy
responsibilities. The chief privacy officer is responsible for privacy compliance
across an organization, including privacy compliance measures that apply to
information security assets and activities. The chief privacy officer works to maintain
a balance between security and privacy requirements, and works to ensure that one
is not compromised for the sake of the other. To this end, the chief privacy officer
serves as the senior official responsible for:
   • Developing, promoting, and supporting the organization’s privacy programs;
   • Encouraging awareness of potential privacy issues and policies; and
   • Reviewing and implementing privacy regulations and legislation.
    Physical Security Officer or other designated official with physical
security responsibilities. The physical security officer is responsible for the overall
implementation and management of physical security controls across an
organization, to include integration with applicable information security controls. As
information security programs are developed, senior agency officials should work to




                                                                                      11
CHAPTER 2                                        Information Security Governance


ensure this coordination of complementary controls. In consideration of information
security, the physical security officer serves as the senior official responsible for:
   • Developing, promulgating, implementing, and monitoring the organization’s
     physical security programs, to include appropriate controls for alternate work
     sites;
   • Ensuring organizational implementation and monitoring of access controls (i.e.,
     authorization, access, visitor control, transmission medium, display medium,
     logging)
   • Coordinating organizational environmental controls (i.e., ongoing and
     emergency power support and backups, fire protection, temperature and
     humidity controls, water damage); and
   • Overseeing and managing controls for delivery and removal of assets.
    Personnel Security Officer or other designated official with personnel
security responsibilities. This responsibility is often resident within the Human
Resources or Human Capital organization. The personnel security officer is
responsible for the overall implementation and management of personnel security
controls across an organization, to include integration with specific information
security controls. As information security programs are developed, senior agency
officials should work to ensure this coordination of complementary controls. In
consideration of information security, the personnel security officer serves as the
senior official responsible for:
   • Developing, promulgating, implementing, and monitoring the organization’s
     personnel security programs;
   • Developing and implementing position categorization (including third-party
     controls), access agreements, and personnel screening, termination, and
     transfers; and
   • Ensuring consistent and appropriate sanctions for personnel violating
     management, operation, or technical information security controls.

Acquisitions/Contracting. The Acquisitions/Contracting function is responsible for
managing contracts and overseeing their implementation. Personnel executing this
function have the following responsibilities in regards to information security:
   • Collaborating with the agency’s SAISO or other appropriate official to ensure
     that the agency’s contracting policies adequately address the agency’s
     information security requirements;
   • Coordinating with the SAISO or other appropriate official as required to ensure
     that all agency contracts and procurements are compliant with the agency’s
     information security policy;
   • Ensuring that all personnel with responsibilities in the agency’s procurement
     process are properly trained in information security; and
   • In concert with the SAISO, facilitating the monitoring of contract performance
     for compliance with the agency’s information security policy.

2.2.4 Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)
   FEA is a business-based framework for governmentwide improvement. The
purpose of FEA is to facilitate cross-agency analyses and identify duplicative


                                                                                      12
CHAPTER 2                                                    Information Security Governance


investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across federal
agencies. 10 FEA facilitates identification of duplicative or wasteful investments, areas
where investments should be made, and where departments and agencies can
collaborate to improve government operations or services.
       The FEA consists of five reference models:
       • The Performance Reference Model (PRM) is a common framework for
         performance measurement that can be applied throughout the FEA.
       • The Business Reference Model (BRM) is a function-driven framework for
         describing the business operations of the federal government independent of
         the agencies.
       • The Service Component Reference Model (SRM) is a business- and
         performance-driven functional framework that classifies service components
         with respect to how they support business and/or performance objectives.
       • The Data and Information Reference Model (DRM) describes, at an aggregate
         level, the data and information that support program and business line
         operations.
       • The Technical Reference Model (TRM) is a component-driven technical
         framework used to identify the standards, specifications, and technologies that
         support and enable the delivery of service components and capabilities.
    OMB requires agencies to integrate security into their enterprise architecture
development life cycle. 11 In addition to complying with OMB requirements, the
integration of information security into the agency enterprise architecture efforts
benefits both the agencies and the federal government:
       • Reduction of the reporting burden. The FEA requires agencies to collect and
         analyze significant amounts of data. The security efforts already under way
         can provide information relevant to the data, technology, and performance
         metrics in place throughout a department, such as the information contained in
         FISMA quarterly and annual reports, accreditation letters, and plan of actions
         and milestones (POA&M).
       • Integration of security data. Organizations should use existing information
         security data sources to identify data for their FEA submissions, thus allowing
         for a continuous and reliable transmission and roll-up of security requirements
         and controls from initial security certification and accreditation documentation
         and POA&Ms into the FEA.
       • Preservation of security requirements. Documenting and preserving
         information about applicable security requirements ensures that it can be used
         as a part of any higher-level federal management or decision-making process.
         If, for example, the federal government were to try and implement a large-
         scale reorganization (such as creating a new department or agency), a
         security-aware FEA would be able to clearly outline not only the intersections of
         common business lines but also the corresponding security requirements. In
         another example, if a department were to mandate using a specific type of
         technological tool, the FEA would be able to highlight the security and privacy
         requirements for the technology as well as the requirements for the data that

         the tool would handle. Since the federal government has numerous IT-related
         efforts under way, including critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and COOP
         processes that seek to preserve national resources as well as the ability of
         departments and agencies to operate in adverse or emergency conditions, a
         security-enabled FEA will provide support to those other efforts while
         simultaneously ensuring that information is appropriately protected within
         these efforts.

2.2.5 Information Security Policy and Guidance
       Information security policy is an aggregate of directives, rules, and practices that
       prescribes how an organization manages, protects, and distributes information. 12
    Information security policy is an essential component of information security
governance—without the policy, governance has no substance and rules to enforce.
Information security policy should be based on a combination of appropriate
legislation, such as FISMA; applicable standards, such as NIST Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) and guidance; and internal agency requirements.
    Agency information security policy should address the fundamentals of agency
information security governance structure, including:
       • Information security roles and responsibilities;
       • Statement of security controls baseline and rules for exceeding the baseline;
         and
       • Rules of behavior that agency users are expected to follow and minimum
         repercussions for noncompliance.
    Supporting guidance and procedures on how to effectively implement specific
controls across the enterprise should be developed to augment an agency’s security
policy. This subsequent guidance on information security, created by the agency, in
consideration of external guidance (e.g. NIST Special Publications and OMB
memoranda), should be consistent with the information security policy and may not
supersede it, unless the policy itself is being modified. Agencies should ensure that
their information security policy is sufficiently current to accommodate the
information security environment and agency mission and operational requirements.
To ensure that information security does not become obsolete, agencies should
implement a policy review and revision cycle. As a part of the periodic review and
the initial development of the information security policies, agencies should work to
ensure that all internal security policies (i.e., physical and personnel) are sufficiently
coordinated to ensure effective implementation of crosscutting and convergent
security objectives, such as access control initiatives.

2.2.6 Ongoing Monitoring
   An effective information security governance program requires constant review.
Agencies should monitor the status of their programs to ensure that:
       • Ongoing information security activities are providing appropriate support to the
         agency mission;
       • Policies and procedures are current and aligned with evolving technologies, if
         appropriate; and
       • Controls are accomplishing their intended purpose.

                                                                                                     14
CHAPTER 2                                                            Information Security Governance


    Over time, policies and procedures may become inadequate because of changes
in agency mission and operational requirements, threats, environment, deterioration
in the degree of compliance, changes in technology or infrastructure, or business
processes. Periodic assessments and reports on activities can be a valuable means of
identifying areas of noncompliance, reminding users of their responsibilities and
demonstrating management's commitment to the security program. While an
organization’s mission does not frequently change, the agency may expand its
mission to secure agency programs and assets and, by extension, require
modification to its information security requirements and practices. It is important
that a change in an organization’s internal requirements is checked against external
federal requirements as, for example, a change to an information system’s security
posture may alter its subsequent reporting requirements.
    To facilitate ongoing monitoring, the SAISO and other officials can compare and
correlate a variety of real-time and static information available from a number of
ongoing activities within and outside of their programs. FISMA requires agencies to
perform an annual assessment of their information security programs and report
information security performance measures quarterly and annually. The intent of
these reporting requirements is to facilitate close to real-time assessment and
monitoring of information security program activities. Ongoing monitoring combines
the use of existing data to oversee a security program, and typically occurs
throughout all phases of the program life cycle. Agencies can use a variety of data
originating from the ongoing information security program activities to monitor
performance of programs under their purview, including POA&Ms, performance
measurements and metrics, continuous assessment, configuration management and
control, network monitoring, and incident statistics.
  Table 2-1 provides a broad overview of key ongoing activities that can assist in
monitoring and improving an agency’s information governance activities.

2.3 Information Security Governance Challenges and Keys to Success
    There are many diverse, and sometimes conflicting, priorities an organization
must account for in meeting information security governance requirements. These
criteria present challenges an organization is likely to face in its efforts to establish
information security governance.
       Some of the most common challenges include:
       • Balancing extensive requirements originating from multiple governing
         bodies. Several different governing and oversight bodies establish governance
         and information security requirements for the federal government. While these
         requirements are seldom contradictory, they are not always complementary,
         and organizations may be faced with the challenge of implementing different
         compliance measures and monitoring these measures for reporting purposes.
       • Balancing legislation and agency-specific policy. Agencies may have more
         stringent requirements that go beyond those required by information security
         legislation, regulation, and directives.
       • Maintaining currency. Governance standards and guidance evolve to support
         different requirements, and new legislation is frequently introduced.
       • Prioritizing available funding according to requirements. Increased
         competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that agencies
         allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security
         investments.
   Information security governance provides a framework for establishing and
maintaining an information security program that will evolve with the organization it

   monitoring.

   See NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, and Chapter 13, Incident Response,
   of this guide for additional guidance on incident and event statistics.



                                                                                                                       17
CHAPTER 2                                           Information Security Governance


supports. The following list is a summary of good information security governance
practices that are critical for ensuring the security of enterprise information assets:
    • Information security activities should be governed based on relevant
      requirements, including laws, regulations, and organizational policies.
    • Senior managers should be actively involved in establishing information
      security governance framework and the act of governing the agency’s
      implementation of information security.
    • Information security responsibilities must be assigned and carried out by
      appropriately trained individuals.
    • Individuals responsible for information security within the agency should be
      held accountable for their actions or lack of actions.
    • Information security priorities should be communicated to stakeholders of all
      levels within an organization to ensure a successful implementation of an
      information security program.
    • Information security activities must be integrated into other management
      activities of the enterprise, including strategic planning, capital planning, and
      enterprise architecture.
    • Information security organization structure should be appropriate for the
      organization it supports and should evolve with the organization, if the
      organization undergoes change.
    • Information security managers should continuously monitor the performance of
      the security program/effort for which they are responsible, using available tools
      and information.
    • Information discovered through monitoring should be used as an input into
      management decisions about priorities and funding allocation to effect the
      improvement of security posture and the overall performance of the
      organization.

Chapter 3
3. System Development Life Cycle
     The system development life cycle (SDLC) is the overall process of developing,
implementing, and retiring information systems through a multistep process from
initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance to disposal. There are
many different SDLC models and methodologies, but each generally consists of a
series of defined steps or phases.
    Various SDLC methodologies have been developed to guide the processes
involved, and some methods work better than others for specific types of projects.
Regardless of the type of the life cycle used by an organization, information security
must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the
information that the system is intended to transmit, process, and store. Security is
most useful and cost-effective when such integration begins with a system
development or integration project initiation, and is continued throughout the SDLC
through system disposal. A number of federal laws and directives require integrating
security into the SDLC, including the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III.
    This section provides a general overview of security integration into the SDLC and
is not intended to prescribe any particular model or methodology. Each phase of the
SDLC includes a minimum set of information security-related activities required to
effectively incorporate security into a system. An organization can either use a
generic SDLC as described in this section or develop a tailored SDLC that meets its
specific needs. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
Publication (SP) 800-64 Rev. 1, Security Considerations in the Information System
Development Life Cycle, presents a framework for incorporating security into all
phases of the SDLC, depicted in Figure 3-1, to ensure the selection, acquisition, and
use of appropriate and cost-effective security controls. 19

3.1 Initiation Phase
     All information technology (IT) projects have a starting point, what is commonly
referred to as the initiation phase. During the initiation phase, the organization
establishes the need for a particular system and documents its purpose. The
information to be processed, transmitted, or stored is typically evaluated, as well as
who is required access to such information and how (in high-level terms). In
addition, it is often determined whether the project will be an independent
information system or a component of an already-defined system. A preliminary risk
assessment is typically conducted in this phase, and security planning documents are
initiated (system security plan).

     Federal Information and Information Systems; NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information
     and Information Systems to Security Categories; and NIST 800-37, (Guide for the Security Certification
     and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems); for additional guidance on security and the SDLC
     process.



                                                                                                        19
CHAPTER 3                                           System Development Life Cycle




                       Figure 3-1. System Development Life Cycle

    Once these tasks have been completed and a need has been recognized for a
new or enhanced IT product or service, several processes must take place before the
project is approved, to include clearly defining project goals and defining high-level
information security requirements. Typically, during this phase, the organization
defines high-level information security policy requirements as well as the enterprise
security system architecture.

3.2 Development/Acquisition Phase
    During this phase, the system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed,
or otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other defined cycles, such as
the system development cycle or the acquisition cycle.
    During the first part of the development/acquisition phase, the organization
should simultaneously define the system’s security and functional requirements.
These requirements can be expressed as technical features (e.g., access control),
assurances (e.g., background checks for system developers), or operational practices
(e.g., awareness and training). During the last part of this phase, the organization
should perform developmental testing of the technical and security
features/functions to ensure that they perform as intended prior to launching the
implementation and integration phase.

3.3 Implementation Phase
    In the implementation phase, the organization configures and enables system
security features, tests the functionality of these features, installs or implements the
system, and finally, obtains a formal authorization to operate the system. Design
reviews and system tests should be performed before placing the system into


                                                                                      20
CHAPTER 3                                                        System Development Life Cycle


operation to ensure that it meets all required security specifications. In addition, if
new controls are added to the application or the support system, additional
acceptance tests of those new controls must be performed. This approach ensures
that new controls meet security specifications and do not conflict with or invalidate
existing controls. The results of the design reviews and system tests should be fully
documented, updated as new reviews or tests are performed, and maintained in the
official organization records.

3.4 Operations/Maintenance Phase
    An effective security program demands comprehensive and continuous
understanding of program and system weaknesses. In the operation and
maintenance phase, systems and products are in place and operating, enhancements
and/or modifications to the system are developed and tested, and hardware and/or
software is added or replaced. During this phase, the organization should
continuously monitor performance of the system to ensure that it is consistent with
preestablished user and security requirements, and needed system modifications are
incorporated.
    For configuration management (CM) and control, it is important to document the
proposed or actual changes in the security plan of the system. Information systems
are typically in a constant state of evolution with upgrades to hardware, software,
firmware, and possible modifications to the surrounding environment where the
system resides. Documenting information system changes and assessing the
potential impact of these changes on the security of a system is an essential part of
continuous monitoring, and key to avoiding a lapse in the system security
accreditation. 20
    Monitoring security controls helps to identify potential security-related problems
in the information system that are not identified during the security impact analysis,
which is conducted as part of the CM and control process.

3.5 Disposal Phase
    The disposal phase of the system life cycle refers to the process of preserving (if
applicable) and discarding system information, hardware, and software. This step is
extremely important because during this phase, information, hardware, and software
are moved to another system, archived, discarded, or destroyed. If performed
improperly, the disposal phase can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
data. When archiving information, organizations should consider the need and
methods for future retrieval. While electronic information is relatively easy to store
and retrieve, problems can arise if the technology used to create the records is no
longer available in the future as a result of obsolescence or incompatibility with new
technologies. Additionally, the organization should consider what measures must be
taken for the future use of data that has been encrypted, such as taking appropriate
steps to ensure the secure long-term storage of cryptographic keys. It is equally
important to consider legal requirements for records retention when disposing of
information systems. For federal systems, system management officials should
consult with their office responsible for retaining and archiving federal records.
    The removal of information from a storage medium, such as a hard disk or tape,
is called sanitization. There are four categories of media sanitization: disposal,

                                                                                                        21

clearing, purging, and destroying. 21 Because different kinds of sanitization provide
different levels of information protection, organizations should use information
security requirements as a guide for selecting the sanitization method that best suits
their needs.

3.6 Security Activities within the SDLC
    Security activities must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure proper
identification, design, integration, and maintenance of applicable security controls
throughout an information system’s life cycle as summarized in Table 3-1.

                             Table 3-1. Security Activities in the SDLC

  SDLC Activities                                  Security Activities and Definitions
A. Initiation Phase
Needs                   Define a problem that might be solved through product acquisition. Traditional components
Determination            of needs determination are establishing a basic system idea, defining preliminary
                         requirements, assessing feasibility, assessing technology, and identifying a form of approval
                         to further investigate the problem.
                        Establish and document need and purpose of the system.
Security                Identify information that will be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system and define
Categorization           applicable levels of information categorization according to NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS
                         199. 22 The handling and safeguarding of personally identifiable information should be
                         considered.
Preliminary Risk        Establish an initial description of the basic security needs of the system. A preliminary risk
Assessment 23            assessment should define the threat environment in which the system or product will operate.

B. Development/Acquisition Phase
Requirements            Conduct a more in-depth study of the need that draws on and further develops the work
Analysis/                performed during the initiation phase.
Development             Develop and incorporate security requirements into specifications.
                        Analyze functional requirements that may include system security environment (e.g.,
                         enterprise information security policy and enterprise security architecture) and security
                         functional requirements.
                        Analyze assurance requirements that address the acquisition and product integration
                         activities required and assurance evidence needed to produce the desired level of confidence
                         that the product will provide required information security features correctly and effectively.
                         The analysis, based on legal, regulatory, protection, and functional security requirements, will
                         be used as the basis for determining how much and what kinds of assurance are required.
Risk Assessment 24      Conduct formal risk assessment to identify system protection requirements. This analysis
                         builds on the initial risk assessment performed during the initiation phase, but will be more in-
                         depth and specific. Security categories derived from FIPS 199 are typically considered during
                         the risk assessment process to help guide the initial selection of security controls for an
                         information system.

Cost                    Determine how much of the product acquisition and integration cost can be attributed to
Considerations and       information security over the life cycle of the system. These costs include hardware,
Reporting 25             software, personnel, and training.

Security Planning 26    Fully document agreed-upon security controls, planned or in place.
                        Develop the system security plan.
                        Develop documents supporting the agency’s information security program (e.g., CM plan,
                         contingency plan, incident response plan, security awareness and training plan, rules of
                         behavior, risk assessment, security test and evaluation results, system interconnection
                         agreements, security authorizations/accreditations, and plans of action and milestones
                         [POA&M]).
                        Develop awareness and training requirements, including user manuals and
                         operations/administrative manuals.
Security Control        Develop, design, and implement security controls described in the respective security plans.
Development 27           For information systems currently in operation, the security plans for those systems that may
                         call for developing additional security controls to supplement the controls already in place or
                         for those that may call for modifying selected controls that are deemed to be less than
                         effective.
Developmental           Test security controls developed for a new information system or product for proper and
Security Test and        effective operation. Some types of security controls (primarily those controls of a
Evaluation               nontechnical nature) cannot be tested and evaluated until the information system is deployed;
                         these controls are typically management and operational controls.
                        Develop test plan/script/scenarios.
Other Planning          Ensure that all necessary components of the product acquisition and integration process are
Components               considered when incorporating security into the life cycle. These components include
                         selection of the appropriate contract type, participation by all necessary functional groups
                         within an organization, participation by the certifier and accreditor, and development and
                         execution of necessary contracting plans and processes.
C. Implementation Phase

Evaluation              Test unit, subsystem, and entire system.
                        Ensure system undergoes technical evaluation (e.g., according to federal laws [Sec. 508],
                         regulations, policies, guidelines, and standards).
Inspection and          Verify and validate that the functionality described in the specification is included in the

                         Security certification also uncovers and describes the known vulnerabilities in the information
                         system. Existing security certification may need to be updated to include acquired products.
                         NIST SP 800-37 states that security certification determines the extent to which the security
                         controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
                         producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements for the system.

Security                   Provide the necessary security authorization of an information system to process, store, or
Accreditation 29            transmit information that is required. This authorization is granted by a senior organization
                            official and is based on the verified effectiveness of security controls to some agreed-upon
                            level of assurance and on an identified residual risk to agency assets or operations. This
                            process determines whether the remaining known vulnerabilities in the information system
                            pose an acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Upon
                            successful completion of this phase, system owners will either have authority to operate,
                            interim authorization to operate, or denial of authorization to operate the information system.
D. Operations/Maintenance Phase

Management and              information system or its surrounding environment. CM and configuration control procedures
Control 30                  are critical to establishing an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components
                            for the information system and for subsequently controlling and maintaining an accurate
                            inventory of any changes to the system.

Continuous                 Monitor security controls to ensure that controls continue to be effective in their application
Monitoring                  through periodic testing and evaluation. Security control monitoring (i.e., verifying the
                            continued effectiveness of those controls over time) and reporting the security status of the
                            information system to appropriate agency officials is an essential activity of a comprehensive
                            information security program. Monitor to ensure system security controls are functioning as
                            required.
                           Perform self-administered or independent security audits or other assessments periodically.
                            Types: using automated tools, internal control audits, security checklists, and penetration
                            testing.
                           Monitor system and/or users. Methods: review system logs and reports, use automated
                            tools, review change management, monitor external sources (trade literature, publications,
                            electronic news, etc.), and perform periodic reaccreditation.

Chapter 4
4. Awareness and Training
    The security awareness and training program is a critical component of the
information security program. It is the vehicle for disseminating security information
that the workforce, including managers, need to do their jobs. In terms of the total
security solution, the importance of the workforce in achieving information security
goals and the importance of training as a countermeasure cannot be overstated.
Establishing and maintaining a robust and relevant information security awareness
and training program as part of the overall information security program is the
primary conduit for providing the workforce with the information and tools needed to
protect an agency’s vital information resources. These programs will ensure that
personnel at all levels of the organization understand their information security
responsibilities to properly use and protect the information and resources entrusted
to them. Agencies that continually train their workforce in organizational security
policy and role-based security responsibilities will have a higher rate of success in
protecting information.
    As cited in audit reports, periodicals, and conference presentations, people are
arguably the weakest element in the security formula that is used to secure systems
and networks. The people factor, not technology, is a critical factor that is often
overlooked in the security equation. It is for this reason that the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
have mandated that more and better attention must be devoted to awareness
activities and role-based training, as they are the only security controls that can
minimize the inherent risk that results from the people who use, manage, operate,
and maintain information systems and networks. 31 Robust and enterprise-wide
awareness and training programs are needed to address this growing concern.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training
Program, provides guidelines that can help federal departments and agencies meet
their information security awareness and training responsibilities defined in FISMA
and in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy. The publication identifies
models for building and maintaining a comprehensive awareness and training
program as part of an organization’s information security program.
   NIST SP 800-50 is a companion publication to NIST SP 800-16, Information
Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model.
NIST SP 800-50 works at a higher strategic level and discusses how to build and
maintain an information security awareness and training program; NIST SP 800-16
addresses a more tactical level and discusses the awareness-training-education
continuum, role-based training, and course content considerations. The learning
continuum is shown in Figure 4-1.

4.1 Awareness and Training Policy
    All users have information security responsibilities. FISMA mandates that all
users complete “awareness training,” though NIST publications call this “awareness.”
FISMA also tasks agencies with identifying and training those individuals who have
significant responsibilities for information security, a requirement formalized by
OPM’s information security awareness and training policy promulgated in June 2004.
OPM’s policy strengthens the FISMA requirement for user exposure to “awareness
training” by adding “at least annually,” and requires agencies to provide “role-
specific training” in accordance with NIST guidance. Although there is no federal

mandate for formal education (provided by colleges or universities) and certification
of information security professionals, they are mentioned in this section since some
agencies include them as part of a comprehensive training solution for federal
employees.

4.2 Components: Awareness, Training, Education, and Certification
    An agency’s information security program policy should contain a clear and
distinct section devoted to agency-wide requirements for the awareness and training
program. Although security awareness and training is generally referred to as “a”
program, many organizations consider awareness and training to be two distinct
functions, each with separate purposes, goals, and approaches. Proper
implementation of these components (with consideration of options like education
and professional certification) promotes professional development, which leads to a
high-performance workforce.
   Requirements for the security awareness and training program should be
documented in the enterprise-level policy and should include:
       • Definition of security roles and responsibilities;
       • Development of program strategy and a program plan;
       • Implementation of the program plan; and
       • Maintenance of the security awareness and training program. 32

4.2.1 Awareness
   Security awareness is a blended solution of activities that promote security,
establish accountability, and inform the workforce of security news. Awareness
seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues. Awareness is a
program that continually pushes the security message to users in a variety of
formats.
   An awareness program includes a variety of tools, communication, outreach, and
metrics development.
       • Tools. Awareness tools are used to promote information security and inform
         users of threats and vulnerabilities that impact their agency and “personal”
         work environment by explaining the “what” but not the “how” of security, and
         communicating what is and what is not allowed. Awareness not only
         communicates information security policies and procedures that need to be
         followed, but also provides the foundation for any sanctions and disciplinary
         actions imposed for noncompliance. Awareness is used to explain the rules of
         behavior for using an agency’s information systems and information and
         establishes a level of expectation on the acceptable use of the information and
         information systems. Types of tools include:
         – Events, such as a security awareness day;
         – Promotional materials;
         – Briefings (program- or system-specific- or issue-specific); and
         – Rules of behavior.
       • Communication. A large part of an awareness effort is communication with
         users, managers, executives, system owners, and others. A communications

        plan is needed to identify stakeholders, types of information that is to be
        disseminated, channels for disseminating information, and the frequency of
        information exchanges. The plan also identifies whether the communications
        are one-way or two-way. Activities that support communication include:
        – Assessment (as is/to be models);
        – Strategic plan; and
        – Program implementation.
   • Outreach. Outreach is critical for leveraging best practices within the federal
     sector. It has two elements for intra- and interagency awareness. The intra-
     agency element promotes internal awareness of information security. A Web
     portal that provides a one-stop-shop for security information can be an
     effective outreach tool. Policy, frequently asked questions (FAQs), security e-
     newsletters, links to resources, and other useful information are easily
     accessible to all employees. This tool promotes a consistent and standard
     message. The interagency element promotes sharing among agencies and is
     used to leverage awareness and training resources.

4.2.2    Training
    Information security training strives to produce relevant and needed security
knowledge and skills within the workforce. Training supports competency
development and helps personnel understand and learn how to perform their security
role. The most important difference between training and awareness is that training
seeks to teach skills that allow a person to perform a specific function, while
awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues.
   Role-based training provides security courses that are tailored to the specific
needs of each group of people who have been identified as having significant
responsibilities for information security in their organization. NIST SP 800-16
provides guidance for establishing role- and performance-based security training
programs.

4.2.3    Education
    Education integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various
functional specialties into a common body of knowledge and adds a multidisciplinary
study of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social). Information
security education strives to produce information security specialists and
professionals who are capable of vision and proactive response. Several colleges and
universities provide academic programs to support the information security needs of
the public and private sectors. Many of these schools partner with the federal sector
to accomplish research and development tasks to improve information security.

4.2.4    Certification
     In response to the growing demand for information security personnel within
federal agencies, there has been a movement toward increased professional
standards for federal and contracted security personnel. This “professionalization”
integrates training, education, and experience with an assessment mechanism to
validate knowledge and skills, resulting in the “certification” of a predefined level of
competence. The relationship among these professional development elements is
illustrated in Figure 4-2.




                                                                                       29

                      Figure 4-2. Elements of Professional Development

    It should be noted that there are distinct differences among certifications that are
offered by a variety of organizations. Primarily, one will encounter certificates of
completion, certifications awarded by an industry and/or vendors, and graduate-level
certificates awarded by academic institutions:
      • Certificates of completion are provided to individuals solely as a testament
        to completion of a particular course—these certificates do not make any claims
        that the individual actually gained knowledge and/or skills.
      • Industry and/or vendor certification requires a combination of training,
        education, and experience. These certifications validate knowledge and skills
        through testing—they provide varying degrees of assurance that an individual
        has a baseline level of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) with regard to a
        predefined body of knowledge. The preparatory work for knowledge-based or
        skill-based certifications normally includes training in a prescribed body of
        knowledge or technical curriculum and is supplemented frequently by on-the-
        job experience.
      • Graduate certificates in information security are awarded by an academic
        institution to individuals who successfully complete all graduation requirements
        for a particular program. These graduate certificates generally require 18 to 21
        credit hours of academic study, have at least four required courses, allow for
        one or two electives, and may require some form of research paper, project, or
        case study.

4.3    Designing, Developing, and Implementing an Awareness and Training
       Program
   The development of an information security awareness and training program
involves three major steps:
      1. Designing the program (including the development of the information security
         awareness and training program plan);



                                                                                       30
CHAPTER 4                                                   Awareness and Training


   2. Developing the awareness and training material; and
   3. Implementing the program.
   Even a small amount of information security awareness and training can go a
long way toward improving the security posture of, and vigilance within, an
organization.

4.3.1   Designing an Awareness and Training Program
    Awareness and training programs must be designed with the mission of the
agency in mind. The awareness and training program must support the business
needs of the organization and be relevant to the organization’s culture and
information technology architecture. The most successful programs are those that
users feel are relevant to the subject matter and issues presented.
   Designing an information security awareness and training program answers the
question “What is our plan for developing and implementing awareness and training
opportunities that are compliant with existing directives?” In the design step of the
program, the agency’s awareness and training needs are identified, an effective
agency-wide awareness and training plan is developed, organizational buy-in is
sought and secured, and priorities are established.

4.3.2   Developing an Awareness and Training Program
   Once the awareness and training program has been designed, supporting
material can be developed. Material should be developed with the following in mind:
   • “What behavior do we want to reinforce?” (awareness)
   • “What skill or skills do we want the audience to learn and apply?” (training and
     education).
    In both cases, the focus should be on specific material that the participants
should integrate into their jobs. Attendees will pay attention and incorporate what
they see or hear in a session if they feel that the material was developed specifically
for them. Any presentation that feels so impersonal and general that it could be
given to any audience, will be filed away as just another of the annual “we’re here
because we have to be here” sessions. An awareness and training program can be
effective, however, if the material is interesting, current, and relevant.
    The awareness audience must include all users in an organization. Users may
include employees, contractors, foreign or domestic guest researchers, other agency
personnel, visitors, guests, and other collaborators or associates requiring access.
The message to be spread through an awareness program, or campaign, should
make all individuals aware of their commonly shared information security
responsibilities.
   On the other hand, the message in a training class is directed at a specific
audience. The message in training material should include everything related to
security that attendees need to know in order to perform their jobs. Training
material is usually far more in-depth than material used in an awareness session or
campaign.

4.3.3   Implementing an Awareness and Training Program
   An information security awareness and training program should be implemented
only after a needs assessment has been conducted, a strategy has been developed,



                                                                                     31
CHAPTER 4                                                                Awareness and Training


an awareness and training program plan for implementing that strategy has been
completed, and awareness and training material has been developed.
    The program’s implementation must be fully explained to the organization to
achieve support for its implementation and commitment of necessary resources.
This explanation includes expectations of agency management and staff support, as
well as expected results of the program and benefits to the organization. Funding
issues must also be addressed. For example, agency managers must know if the
cost to implement the awareness and training program will be totally funded by the
chief information officer (CIO) or information security program budget, or if their
budgets will be impacted to cover their share of the expense of implementing the
program. It is essential that everyone involved in the implementation of the
program understand their roles and responsibilities. In addition, schedules and
completion requirements must be communicated.
   Once the plan for implementing the awareness and training program has been
explained to (and accepted by) agency management, the implementation can begin.
Since there are several ways to present and disseminate awareness and training
material throughout an organization, agencies should tailor their implementation to
the size, organization, and complexity of their enterprise. 33

4.4 Post-Implementation
    An organization’s information security awareness and training program can
quickly become obsolete if sufficient attention is not paid to technology
advancements, IT infrastructure changes, organizational changes, and shifts in
organizational mission and priorities. CIOs and senior agency information security
officers (SAISOs) need to be cognizant of this potential problem and incorporate
mechanisms into their strategy to ensure that the program continues to be relevant
and compliant with overall objectives. Continuous improvement should always be
the theme for security awareness and training initiatives, as this is one area where
“you can never do enough.” Efforts supporting this post-implementation feedback
loop should be developed in consideration of the security organization’s overall
ongoing performance measures program. 34

4.4.1      Monitoring Compliance
   Once the program has been implemented, processes must be put in place to
monitor compliance and effectiveness. An automated tracking system should be
designed to capture key information on program activity (e.g., courses, dates,
audience, costs, sources). The tracking system should capture this data at an
agency level, so it can be used to provide enterprise-wide analysis and reporting
regarding awareness, training, and education initiatives.
    Tracking compliance involves assessing the status of the program as indicated by
the database information and mapping it to standards established by the agency.
Reports can be generated and used to identify gaps or problems. Corrective action
and necessary follow-up can then be taken. This follow-up may take the form of
formal reminders to management; additional awareness, training, or education
offerings; and/or the establishment of a corrective plan with scheduled completion
dates.

4.4.2   Evaluation and Feedback

    Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any
security awareness and training program. Continuous improvement cannot occur
without a good sense of how the existing program is working. In addition, the
feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives initially established for
the program. Once the baseline requirements have been solidified, a feedback
strategy can be designed and implemented. Various evaluation and feedback
mechanisms that can be used to update the awareness and training program plan
include surveys, evaluation forms, independent observation, status reports,
interviews, focus groups, technology shifts, and/or benchmarking.

   A feedback strategy should incorporate elements that address quality, scope,
deployment method (e.g., Web-based, onsite, offsite), level of difficulty, ease of use,
duration of session, relevancy, currency, and suggestions for modification.
   Metrics are essential to feedback and evaluation. They can be used to:
   • Measure the effectiveness of the security awareness and training program;
   • Provide information for many of the data requests that an agency must provide
     with regard to compliance; and,
   • Provide an important gauge for demonstrating progress and identifying areas
     for improvement.

4.5 Managing Change
    It is necessary to ensure that the program, as structured, continues to evolve as
new technology and associated security issues emerge. Training needs will shift as
new skills and capabilities become necessary to respond to new architectural and
technology changes. A change in the organizational mission and/or objectives can
also influence ideas on how best to design training solutions and content. Emerging
issues, such as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of security
awareness and training activities necessary to keep users informed and/or trained
about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. New laws and court
decisions may also impact agency policy that, in turn, may affect the development
and/or implementation of awareness and training material. Finally, as security
policies evolve, awareness and training material should reflect these changes.

4.6 Program Success Indicators
    CIOs, program officials, and SAISOs should be primary advocates for awareness,
training, education, and professionalization. Securing an organization’s information
and infrastructure is a team effort, requiring the dedication of capable individuals to
carry out their assigned security roles within the organization. Listed below are
some key indicators to gauge the support for, and acceptance of, the program:
   • Key stakeholder demonstrates commitment and support;
   • Sufficient funding is budgeted and available to implement the agreed-upon
     awareness and training strategy;
   • Appropriate organizational placement of senior officials with key security
     responsibilities (CIO, program officials, and SAISO) facilitates strategy
     implementation;




                                                                                     33
CHAPTER 4                                                   Awareness and Training


    • Infrastructure to support broad distribution (e.g., Web, e-mail, learning
      management systems) and posting of security awareness and training
      materials is funded and implemented;
    • Executive/senior-level officials deliver messages to staff regarding security
      (e.g., staff meetings, broadcasts to all users by agency head), champion the
      program, and demonstrate support for training by committing financial
      resources to the program;
    • Metrics indicate improved security performance by the workforce (e.g., to
      explain a decline in security incidents or violations, indicate that the gap
      between existing awareness and training coverage and identified needs is
      shrinking, the percentage of users being exposed to awareness material is
      increasing, the percentage of users with significant security responsibilities
      being appropriately trained is increasing);
    • Executives and managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid
      security controls that are consistently adhered to by the rank and file;
    • Level of attendance at security forums/briefings/training is consistently high.
    • Recognition of security contributions (e.g., awards, contests) is a standard
      practice within an agency; and
    • Individuals playing key roles in managing/coordinating the security program
      demonstrate commitment to the program and motivation to promote the
      program.

Chapter 5
5. Capital Planning and Investment
   Control
    Increased competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that
agencies allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security
investments to afford the agency and its systems and data, the appropriate degree
of security for their needs. This goal can be achieved through a formal enterprise
capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process designed to facilitate and
control the expenditure of agency funds. The Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) and other existing federal regulations charge federal
agencies with integrating information security activities and the capital planning and
investment control process. The practices discussed in this chapter are designed to
help security practitioners and managers identify funding needs to secure systems
and provide strategies for obtaining the necessary funding.

5.1 Legislative Overview
   Implementation of information security within the federal government is guided
by a combination of legislation, rules and regulations, and agency-specific policies.
FISMA is the overarching information security legislation for federal information
systems. Signed into law in 2002, FISMA:
     • Charges the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NIST to develop
       security standards and identify tolerable security risk levels;
     • Makes NIST standards compulsory for all agencies; FISMA eliminated an
       agency’s ability to obtain waivers on NIST standards (Federal Information
       Processing Standard [FIPS]); and
     • Charges agencies to integrate information security into CPIC.
     • NIST SP 800-53 identifies a set of minimum security controls applicable to
       information systems based on FIPS 199 categorization (low, moderate, high).
     • OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to complete Exhibit 300s and an Exhibit
       53. The Exhibit 300 reflects an investment’s plan for capital asset management.
       The Exhibit 300 is an input to the Exhibit 53, which provides the total
       information technology (IT) and information security spending for the year.
     • FISMA Report is an annual report to OMB detailing the agency’s security
       posture and any areas of weakness. 35
     • Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) documents each agency security
       weakness, associated corrective action, and the corrective action cost. 36
   As Figure 5-1 illustrates, the corrective action and cost information contained in
the POA&M serve as inputs to the Exhibit 300s and are then rolled into the Exhibit



35
   See Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments, of this guide for additional
   guidance on FISMA reporting.

                                                                                                          35
CHAPTER 5                                 Capital Planning and Investment Control


53. Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are part of the agency’s budget submission to OMB
and provide an overview of an agency’s IT portfolio.
    To facilitate effective implementation of OMB capital planning and NIST security
requirements, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) offers a Select-Control-
Evaluate investment life-cycle model as a best practices approach to investment
management. While not compulsory, the framework articulates key activities for
managing IT investments throughout the life cycle. The three phases ensure that
investment management practices, including security, are disciplined and thorough
throughout each phase of the investment life cycle. Figure 5-1 illustrates the three
phases.
    The Select phase refers to activities involved with assessing and prioritizing
current and proposed IT projects based on mission needs and improvement
priorities, and then creates a portfolio of IT projects to address these needs and
priorities. Typical Select phase activities include screening new projects; analyzing
and ranking all projects based on benefit, cost, and risk criteria; selecting a portfolio
of projects; and establishing project review schedules.
   The Control phase refers to activities designated to monitor the investment
during its operational phase to determine whether the investment is within the cost
and schedule milestones established at the beginning of the investment life cycle.
Typical processes involved in the Control phase include using a set of performance
measures to monitor the developmental progress for each IT project to enable early
problem identification and resolution.
   The Evaluate phase refers to determining the efficacy of the investment,
answering the question, “Did the investment achieve the desired results and
performance goals identified during the Select phase?”

                                                                                       36

    Figure 5-1 illustrates the relationship between security drivers in the GAO Select-
Control-Evaluate investment lifecycle and the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC). During the Select phase, security drivers include assessment activities to
ensure that IT security investments comply with security requirements. During the
Control phase, investments are monitored through the use of security metrics to
ensure that security controls are in place and operational, and that investments
remain compliant with requirements. During the Evaluate phase, security drivers
include self-assessment activities to ensure compliance and media sanitization efforts
following removal from operation and prior to disposition.

5.2      Integrating Information Security into the CPIC Process
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-65, Integrating IT Security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control
Process, provides a seven-step process, illustrated in Figure 5-2, for prioritizing
security activities and corrective actions:
      1. Identify the Baseline: use
         information security metrics or
         other available data to baseline
         the current security posture.
      2. Identify Prioritization
         Requirements: evaluate
         security posture against
         legislative and chief information
         officer (CIO)-articulated
         requirements and agency
         mission.
      3. Conduct Enterprise-Level
         Prioritization: prioritize
         potential enterprise-level
         information security investments
         against the mission and the
         financial impact of implementing
         appropriate security controls.
      4. Conduct System-Level
         Prioritization: prioritize
         potential system-level corrective
         actions against system category
         and corrective action impact.
      5. Develop Supporting Materials:
         for enterprise-level investments,    Figure 5-2. Integrating Information Security
                                                         into the CPIC Process
         develop concept paper, business
         case analysis, and Exhibit 300. For system-level investments, adjust Exhibit
         300 to request additional funding to mitigate prioritized weaknesses.
      6. Implement Investment Review Board (IRB) and Portfolio
         Management: prioritize agency-wide business cases against requirements
         and CIO priorities and determine investment portfolio.
      7. Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management:
         ensure approved 300s become part of the agency’s Exhibit 53; ensure
         investments are managed through their life cycle.


                                                                                        37
CHAPTER 5                                           Capital Planning and Investment Control


   The following sections provide an overview of the integration of information
security into the CPIC process to help ensure that corrective actions identified in the
annual FISMA reporting process through POA&Ms are incorporated into the CPIC
process to deliver maximum security in a cost-effective manner.

5.3 Capital Planning and Investment Control Roles and Responsibilities 37
    Integrating information security into the CPIC process requires input and
collaboration across operating units and lines of business throughout the life cycle of
technology investments. Figure 5-3 depicts a hierarchical approach to the CPIC
process in which investment decisions are made at both the enterprise and
operating-unit levels.




                            Figure 5-3. Notional IT Management Hierarchy

    While specific practices for investment management can differ at the operating-
unit level because of varying mission scopes, the process generally mirrors the
process at the departmental level. The CIO formulates and articulates information
security priorities to the organization to be considered within the context of all
agency investments. Priorities may be based on agency mission and executive
branch guidance such as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), OMB guidance,
or other external/internal priorities. Examples of security priorities include certifying
and accrediting all systems or implementing public key infrastructure (PKI)
throughout the enterprise. It is important to note that OMB/executive branch
guidance or laws should be ranked highest among these priorities.
   Once operating units finalize their IT portfolios and budget requests for the
budget year, they forward their requests to the agency-level decision makers. At the

     See Chapter 2, Information Security Governance, Chapter 8, Security Planning, Chapter 11,
     Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments, and Chapter 14, Configuration Management, of
     this guide for additional guidance on roles and responsibilities.



                                                                                                        38
CHAPTER 5                               Capital Planning and Investment Control


agency level, several committees evaluate IT portfolios from the operating units as
referenced in Figure 5-3, culminating in a review by the IRB. The IRB then decides
on an agency-level IT portfolio and forwards recommendations to the agency head
for review. Once the agency-level IT portfolio is approved by the agency head, the
necessary Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are forwarded to OMB for funding
consideration.
    Many different stakeholders, from information security, capital planning, and
executive leadership areas, have key roles and make decisions on integrating
information security into the CPIC process with the ultimate goal of forming a well-
balanced IT portfolio. Involvement at the enterprise and operating-unit levels
throughout the process allows agencies to ensure that CPIC and information security
goals and objectives are met. Figure 5-4 identifies typical leading, supporting, or
approving roles for each stakeholder as they apply to the integration of security into
the CPIC process phases.




          Figure 5-4. Roles and Responsibilities throughout the CPIC Process


5.4 Identify Baseline
    The first step in integrating information security and the CPIC process is to
assess the security baseline. The security baseline provides a snapshot of the
agency’s compliance with baseline security requirements (BLSRs) and is instrumental
in identifying information security strengths and weaknesses. The result of a
security baseline analysis enables agency executives to evaluate their information
security posture and identify areas for improvement. Agencies can identify their
baselines for enterprise-level and system-level investments. System-level
investments are those security investments designed to strengthen a discrete
system’s security posture, such as strengthening password controls or testing a
contingency plan for a particular system. Enterprise-level investments are those
security investments that are ubiquitous across the agency and will improve the
overall agency’s security posture, such as the acquisition of an enterprise-wide
firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS).




                                                                                    39
CHAPTER 5                                            Capital Planning and Investment Control


    NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems,
provides guidance on developing and implementing an information security metrics
program. Metrics can provide baseline compliance percentages that indicate the
existence of adequate security controls, highlight current weaknesses, and identify
gaps between actual and desired implementation status of information security
controls. The goal of the security baseline establishment exercise is to provide
agency officials an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities
that exist within the agency’s security controls and to help identify investments that
are required to mitigate weaknesses. The resulting vulnerabilities and weaknesses
then serve as inputs into the next step of the CPIC process: identifying prioritization
criteria.

5.5 Identify Prioritization Criteria
    Available funding does not always allow all security needs identified in the
baseline assessment to be addressed immediately. Therefore, requirements must be
prioritized to address the most pressing security investment needs first. Specific
prioritization criteria will vary from agency to agency depending on specific agency
mission and goals and applicable legislation and regulations. Examples of
information security priorities include:
       • Complying with statutory requirements in Clinger-Cohen Act, FISMA, and OMB
         Circular A-130 guidance;
       • Implementing a risk-based security program (FISMA, Executive Orders, and
         supporting NIST standards and guidance); for example, implementing the
         security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53;
       • Safeguarding national and agency mission-critical assets (Homeland Security
         Presidential Directives);
       • Improving information security program status; and
       • Completing a security certification and accreditation of all systems in
         accordance with NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
         Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.
   A variety of taxonomies can be used to organize prioritization criteria, including
FIPS 200 security control families or other agency-specific categories.

5.6 Conduct System- and Enterprise-Level Prioritization 38
    Once agency management and stakeholders agree on the prioritization of
investments, the agency can begin the prioritizing process by rank-ordering
requirements against the prioritization criteria. The objective of this activity is to
fund first the most critical security investment. The next layer of funding should
then be applied to the next critical security investment and so forth, until the
security budget is entirely expended, or priorities met, whichever comes first.
   Before conducting corrective action prioritization, the agency should allocate the
funding necessary to mitigate significant deficiencies and other needs that obviously
require attention. These initiatives should then be removed from the prioritization
process to avoid duplication of effort.
    After identifying the security baseline and prioritization criteria, an agency can
prioritize corrective actions at two levels:

38
     The information presented in this special publication provides an overview of the prioritization process.
     For a detailed explanation of suggested system- and enterprise-level prioritization procedures, see NIST
     SP 800-65, pages 28-36.



                                                                                                           40

        1. System-level prioritization: prioritize corrective actions to address
           system-level security weaknesses and vulnerabilities found during the
           baseline assessment against the predefined prioritization criteria. This
           prioritization is performed at the operating unit level by system owners and
           program managers. 39
        2. Enterprise-level prioritization: prioritize enterprise-wide security
           corrective actions identified during the baseline assessment based on
           predefined prioritization criteria. This prioritization is performed at the
           enterprise level by agency information security stakeholders.
   The prioritization methodology relies primarily on existing data sources and
inputs. Specific data inputs for the two types of prioritization are highlighted in
Table 5-1.

    Some of the data inputs need to be manipulated further to support the corrective
action prioritization process:

       • Compliance gap: the difference between the desired and actual compliance
         with the security requirements. For example, if an information system has
         completed 80 percent of security certification and accreditation activities, that
         investment would have a security certification and accreditation compliance gap
         of 20 percent. (The actual compliance of 80 percent is subtracted from the
         desired compliance of 100 percent to yield a 20 percent compliance gap.) The
         smaller the compliance gap, the more compliant the system or enterprise
         control. For key information security activities, this information is part of the
         FISMA report.
       • Corrective action impact: the ratio of compliance gap to corrective action
         cost. As shown in Figure 5-5, the corrective action impact is calculated by
         dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to implement the
         corresponding corrective
         action(s). This ratio
         provides a proportion of
         result to cost. The
         higher the impact
         proportion, the more
         “bang for the buck” the        Figure 5-5. Corrective Action Impact Calculation
         corrective action will provide. The resulting proportion is multiplied by 100,000
         to facilitate further calculations.
    After assembling process inputs, conduct the following four steps to complete the
prioritization process:
           1. Rank-order prioritized corrective action categories according to selected
              prioritization criteria in order of importance to the agency;
           2. Rank-order agency systems according to system category;
           3. Calculate the security compliance gaps at the enterprise and investment
              levels; and
           4. Calculate the corrective action impact at the enterprise and investment
              levels.
    Both enterprise- and system-level prioritization should be performed and then
overlapped to ensure that appropriate agency priorities receive funding
commensurate with their risk levels. Prioritization may be facilitated using a
spreadsheet or a more sophisticated automation tool. 41 Visualization of the
prioritization may be used to facilitate the decision-making process.
    Figure 5-6 demonstrates an example of a corrective action prioritization
visualization approach using notional data. From a system-level perspective, Figure
5-6 plots system category along the vertical axis and corrective action impact along
the horizontal axis. The notional agency systems are denoted as the small letters at
the top of each quadrant. In this example, systems “N” and “F” were found to have
category rankings of “high” and corrective action impacts of “great.”




41
     Figures 4-6 and 4-8 on pages 31 and 34 (respectively) in NIST SP 800-65 provide examples of how
     spreadsheets can be used to facilitate the prioritization process.



                                                                                                       42
CHAPTER 5                                 Capital Planning and Investment Control




                          Figure 5-6. Joint Prioritization with Costs

   Drawn from the perspective of the enterprise, Figure 5-6 plots agency-
determined security controls importance along the vertical axis and corrective action
impact along the horizontal axis. The numbers (1-17) represent the seventeen NIST
SP 800-53 security control areas used for this example. Security control area 12
ranked “high” in importance but had a “basic” corrective action impact.
    The dollar figures in Figure 5-6 represent the total cost to implement all
corrective actions within that cell. For example, looking at cell HG, it would cost the
agency $85,961 to implement corrective actions for systems “N” and “F” and topic
area “4.” After plotting all of its systems, the agency should perform executive
validation of the placement of the various systems to ensure that stakeholders’
priorities are met.
    Agency information security stakeholders should review the prioritization results
to ensure that the prioritization is appropriate and given the opportunity to
reprioritize their inputs if the results of the process are found to be unsatisfactory.
Assuming the agency stakeholders agree that all prioritized corrective actions are
appropriate, as displayed in Figure 5-6, the analysis can proceed accordingly. As
indicated by the axes, the implementation of corrective actions should begin with cell
HG and proceed diagonally down to cell LB to ensure that the agency implements the
most cost-effective, high-impact corrective actions.
    To continue with the example, assume the notional agency has a $2,000,000
budget to implement information security corrective actions. As Figure 5-6
demonstrates, adding the three highest priority cells together (HG, HA, and MG)
brings a total of $891,775, which is nearly half of the corrective action budget. The
agency would then move to the next tier of prioritization, or cells HB, MA, and LG.
Totaling these cells yields a total of $503,350, which combined with the previous



                                                                                      43
CHAPTER 5                                            Capital Planning and Investment Control


total from HG, HA, and MG, yields a running total of $1,395,125. With $604,875
remaining in the corrective action budget, the agency would proceed with
prioritization into cells MB and LA. Totaling those two cells yields $2,619,505.
Clearly, this total exceeds the remaining corrective action budget, so stakeholders
will have to decide on how to allocate the remaining dollars. Should stakeholders
determine that the corrective action impact order (G, A, B) is the driving factor, the
corrective actions in cell LA will be implemented. If the stakeholders determine that
the system and security control category (H, M, L) is the driving factor, the
corrective actions from cell MB will be implemented until the remaining $604,875 is
expended. 42

5.7 Develop Supporting Materials
    Once prioritizing against requirements is completed, operating units are poised to
select their investments for the budget year and begin the process of requesting
funding from OMB for the next year to implement the corrective actions and security
controls.
    The Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities
required for full internal review (e.g., IRB, CIO). More importantly, Exhibit 300 is
the document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding
decisions, and therefore should be leveraged by agencies to clearly demonstrate the
need for life cycle and annual funding requests. The Exhibit 300 is completed for
new IT investments and is resubmitted annually for mixed life-cycle and steady-state
investments. Operating units should evaluate their prioritized corrective actions and
security controls identified during the prioritization process and determine whether
the outputs need to be incorporated into an existing investment’s Exhibit 300 or
whether they will need to create an independent Exhibit 300 for a new investment.

5.8 IRB and Portfolio Management
   The IRB reviews and selects investments for the agency portfolio based on the
Exhibit 300s forwarded by the operating units. Like the prioritization that occurs at
the operating-unit level, the IRB typically uses strategic selection criteria to rank-
order the investment pool and usually makes decisions based on agency mission and
goals, not just on cost. While security is not the typical driving force behind portfolio
management, it is a critical element in the investment strategy because it serves as
a qualifier for receiving funding and as a business enabler for those functions which
support the agency’s mission. After prioritizing and approving select Exhibit 300s,
the IRB creates an investment portfolio request for review by OMB.

5.9 Exhibits 53 and 300 and Program Management
    Following selection into the agency’s IT portfolio, the agency aggregates Exhibit
300s into the Exhibit 53. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire
IT portfolio by listing every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year cost
information.
   In addition to containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 also
contains other IT investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (e.g., legacy systems
with costs below agency thresholds). OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and

Exhibit 300s and determines appropriate funding amounts for the budget year based
on the justification articulated in the Exhibit 300s. Agencies then receive their
budget year funding and must implement or maintain their investments throughout
the year by applying allocated funding.

Chapter 6
6. Interconnecting Systems
     A system interconnection is defined as the direct connection of two or more
information systems for sharing data and other information resources. Organizations
choose to interconnect their information systems for a variety of reasons based on
their organizational needs. For example, they may interconnect information systems
to exchange data, collaborate on joint projects, or securely store data and backup
files.
   An interconnection is a direct connection between one organization’s system with
another system of the same or different organization through a mechanism by which
they are joined (the “pipe” through which data is made available, exchanged, or
passed one way only). The “pipe” may be a dedicated line that is owned by one of
the organizations or is leased from a third party (e.g., Integrated Services Digital
Network [ISDN], T1 or T3 line). Alternately, the systems may be connected over a
public network (e.g., Internet) using a virtual private network (VPN).
   Figure 6-1 depicts the concept of information system interconnection.




                    Figure 6-1. Information System Interconnection

   The following are examples of interconnections:
   • System A is connected to System B over a subscriber line leased by System A
     or System B.
   • System A is segmented such that System A1 is integrated with System A but is
     under different management control: Authorizing Official (AO).
   • System B provides data transport services between System A and System C.
     Here, System B is engaged in two interconnections with Systems A and C.
    Levels of system interconnection may vary. For example, some organizations
may choose to establish a limited interconnection, whereby users are restricted to a
single application or file location with rules governing access. Other organizations
may establish a broader interconnection, enabling users to access multiple
applications or databases. Still other organizations may establish an interconnection
that permits full transparency and access across their respective enterprises.
    Interconnecting information systems can expose the participating organizations
to risk. If the interconnection is not properly designed, security failures could
compromise the connected systems and their data. Similarly, if one of the connected
systems is compromised, the interconnection could be used as a conduit to
compromise the other system and its data.
   Federal policy requires that federal agencies establish interconnection security
agreements. Specifically, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Appendix III, requires that agencies obtain written management authority before
connecting their information systems to other systems, based on a mutually
acceptable level of risk. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)


                                                                                   46
CHAPTER 6                                                                  Interconnecting Systems


Special Publication (SP) 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information
Technology Systems, provides detailed guidance on interconnecting information
systems.

6.1 Managing System Interconnections
    All federal agencies must explicitly address the subject of interconnecting
information systems by establishing formal agreements that specify the technical
and security requirements of the interconnection, define the responsibilities of the
participating organizations, and specify the rules governing these interconnections.
In addition to an A-130, Appendix III, requirement to obtain written management
authority before interconnecting information systems, OMB recommends that
agencies use NIST SP 800-47 to ensure compliance for connections to non-agency
systems. 43
    When organizations are properly managing interconnected systems, the added
benefits include greater efficiency, centralized access to data, and greater
functionality. The security controls of each of the interconnected systems should be
evaluated and meet each other’s requirements for implementing security controls
that are appropriate for the particular interconnection. Both organizations should
specify their requirements regarding the security controls to be implemented in
accordance with NIST FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems.
    Each system involved in interconnection should be governed by an organization’s
AO who has the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating a system at
an acceptable level of risk. NIST SP 800-53 specifically defines an information
systems connections control (specified in Table 6-1) that organizations are required
to implement based on an information system’s security categorization. Since these
categorizations and guidance apply to individual systems, agencies should carefully
weigh the associated risks when systems differing in configuration or security
controls are interconnected.

                Table 6-1. NIST SP 800-53 Information System Connections Control
Identifier         Title                                         Control
CA-3          Information     The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to
              System          other information systems outside of the accreditation boundary and regularly
              Connections     monitors/controls the system interconnections. Appropriate organizational
                              officials approve information system interconnection agreements.

       It is critical that both organizations maintain clear lines of communication to:
       • Ensure that the interconnection is properly maintained and that security
         controls remain effective;
       • Facilitate effective change management activities by making it easy for both
         sides to notify each other about planned system changes that could affect the
         interconnection; and
       • Enable prompt notification by both sides of security incidents and system
         disruptions and facilitate coordinated response, if necessary.

     Agency Privacy Management.’



                                                                                                         47

     Identifying and implementing security controls is vital in protecting the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and the data that
is transferred between the systems. If security controls are not in place or if they
are configured improperly, the process of establishing the interconnection could
expose the information systems to unauthorized access. Agencies should select
applicable controls from NIST SP 800-53, based on the security categorization of the
systems involved in the interconnection from FIPS 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-
60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories. The security controls should be appropriately selected in consideration
of the systems that will be connected and the environment in which the
interconnection will operate.
    One or both organizations should review the security controls for the
interconnection at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs to either
system or the operational environment. This review is intended to ensure that all
controls are operating properly and still provide the requisite degree of system and
data security. 44

6.2 Life-Cycle Management Approach
    NIST SP 800-47 details a four-phase “life-cycle management” approach for
interconnecting information systems that emphasizes proper attention to information
security:
       • Phase 1: Planning the Interconnection;
       • Phase 2: Establishing the Interconnection;
       • Phase 3: Maintaining the Interconnection; and
       • Phase 4: Disconnecting the Interconnection.

6.2.1 Phase 1: Planning the Interconnection
   The process of connecting two or more information systems begins with a
planning phase, where the participating organizations perform preliminary activities
and examine all relevant technical, security, and administrative issues. The planning
phase ensures that the interconnection will operate as efficiently and securely as
possible. Six steps are recommended for planning a system interconnection. Figure
6-2 illustrates the step-by-step process to plan a system interconnection. A more
detailed process is described in the following paragraphs.




44
     See NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems; Chapter 10, Risk
     Management, and Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments, of this guide can
     be consulted for additional guidance on security control reviews.



                                                                                                        48
CHAPTER 6                                                                 Interconnecting Systems




                          Figure 6-2. Steps to Plan a System Interconnection

Step 1: Establish a Joint Planning Team
    The organizations should consider establishing a joint planning team composed of
appropriate management and technical staff that includes program managers,
system security officers, system administrators, network administrators, and system
architects. The typical joint planning team is responsible for coordinating all aspects
of the planning process and ensuring that it has both clear direction and sufficient
resources. It also must have the commitment and support of the system and data
owners, and other senior managers.

Step 2: Define the Business Case
    Both organizations should work together to define the purpose of the
interconnection, determine how it will support their mission requirements, and
identify potential costs and risks. Defining the business case will establish the basis
of the interconnection and facilitate the planning process. Factors that should be
considered are estimated costs (e.g., staffing, equipment, facilities), expected
benefits (e.g., improved efficiency), and potential risks (e.g., technical, legal, and
financial).

Step 3: Perform Certification and Accreditation
    Establishing an interconnection may represent a significant change to the
connected systems. Before proceeding further, each organization should consider
recertification and reaccreditation of its respective system(s) to verify that security
protections remain acceptable. A full security certification and accreditation might
not be necessary, however, if the system continues to operate within an acceptable
level of risk; in that case, an abbreviated certification and accreditation would
suffice. 45

Step 4: Determine Interconnection Requirements
   The joint planning team should identify and examine all relevant technical,
security, and administrative requirements surrounding the proposed interconnection.

Step 5: Document Interconnection Agreement
   The interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a security document that
specifies the technical and security requirements for establishing, operating, and
maintaining the interconnection. It also supports the memorandum of

45
     See NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
     Systems, and Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments, of this guide can be
     consulted for additional guidance on C&A.



                                                                                                         49
CHAPTER 6                                                   Interconnecting Systems


understanding/memorandum of agreement (MOU/MOA) between the organizations.
Specifically, the ISA documents the requirements for connecting the information
systems, describes the security controls that will be used to protect the systems and
data, contains a topological drawing of the interconnection, and provides a signature
line.
    The joint planning team should document an agreement governing the
interconnection and the terms under which the organizations will abide. The
agreement should be based on the team’s review of all relevant technical, security,
and administrative requirements identified and examined in Step 4.
    The MOU/MOA documents the terms and conditions for sharing data and
information resources. It defines the purpose of the interconnection, identifies
relevant authorities, specifies the responsibilities of each organization, defines the
apportionment of costs, and identifies the timeline for terminating or reauthorizing
the interconnection. In order to operate as an instrument that can be enforced by
any agency that is a party to the interconnection, the MOU/MOA must be signed by
an organization official, typically the authorizing official (AO). Lastly, because the ISA
and the MOU/MOA may contain sensitive information, the original document and any
copies should be protected appropriately against unauthorized disclosure or
modification, damage, or destruction.

Step 6: Approve or Reject System Interconnection
    The joint planning team should submit the ISA and the MOU/MOA to the AO of
each organization, requesting approval for the interconnection. Upon receipt, the
AOs should review the ISA, the MOU/MOA, and any other relevant documentation or
activities. Organizations may combine ISAs and MOU/MOAs to simplify their
management processes and reduce paperwork if these two documents fall within the
purview of the same AO. When combining ISAs and MOU/MOAs, organizations must
ensure that the contents and the intent of these two documents remain unaltered.
   Based on this review, the AOs should decide on one of the following:
   • Approve the interconnection;
   • Grant interim approval; or
   • Reject the interconnection.

6.2.2 Phase 2: Establishing the Interconnection
    After the system interconnection is planned and approved, it can be
implemented. The recommended steps for establishing the system interconnection
are provided in Figure 6-3.




          Figure 6-3. Recommended Steps for Establishing the Interconnection

Step 1: Develop an Implementation Plan
    To ensure that the information systems are connected properly and securely, the
joint planning team should develop a system interconnection implementation plan. At
a minimum, the implementation plan should:


                                                                                       50
CHAPTER 6                                                   Interconnecting Systems


   • Describe the information systems that will be connected;
   • Identify the sensitivity or classification level of data that will be made available,
     exchanged, or passed one way across the interconnection;
   • Identify personnel who will establish and maintain the interconnection and
     specify their responsibilities;
   • Identify implementation tasks and procedures;
   • Identify and describe security controls that will be used to protect the
     confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and data;
   • Provide test procedures and measurement criteria to ensure that the
     interconnection operates properly and securely;
   • Specify training requirements for users, including a training schedule; and
   • Cite or include all relevant documentation, such as system security plans,
     design specifications, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Step 2: Execute the Implementation Plan
   After the implementation plan is developed, it should be reviewed and approved
by senior members of the planning team and then executed. A list of recommended
tasks for establishing an interconnection includes:
   • Implement or configure security controls;
   • Install or configure hardware and software;
   • Integrate applications;
   • Conduct operational and security assessments;
   • Conduct security training and awareness;
   • Update system security plans; and
   • Perform recertification and reaccreditation.
   Procedures associated with each task should be described in the implementation
plan.

Step 3: Activate the Interconnection
   Both parties should activate the interconnection following the implementation
plan execution. Each agency should closely and frequently examine the system’s
audit logs and the types of assistance requested by the system’s users during this
time to ensure that it operates properly and securely. Lastly, the appropriate agency
should promptly document and address any security weaknesses or problems.

6.2.3 Phase 3: Maintaining the Interconnection
    After the interconnection is established, the participating organizations must
actively maintain it to ensure that it operates properly and securely. The following
activities are recommended for maintaining the interconnection:
   • Maintain the equipment;
   • Manage user profiles;
   • Conduct security reviews;
   • Analyze audit logs;
   • Report and respond to security incidents;
   • Coordinate contingency planning activities;
   • Perform change management; and
   • Maintain system security plans.




                                                                                       51
CHAPTER 6                                                 Interconnecting Systems


6.2.4 Phase 4: Disconnecting the Interconnection
   Phase-out may either be planned or it may be an emergency. Organizations may
wish to restore some of the disconnections but not others.

6.3 Terminating Interconnection
    An organization might have a variety of reasons to terminate an interconnection,
for instance, changed business needs, cost considerations, or changes in system
configuration. The decision to terminate the interconnection should be made by the
system owner with the advice of appropriate management and technical staff. Before
terminating the interconnection, the initiating party should provide written notice to
the receiving party. In turn, the receiving party should acknowledge receipt of the
notification. The notification should describe the reason(s) for the disconnection,
provide the proposed timeline for the disconnection, and identify technical and
management staff that will conduct the disconnection.
    The schedule for terminating the interconnection should permit a reasonable time
period for internal business planning so both sides can make appropriate
arrangements. In addition, staff from both organizations should coordinate to
determine the logistics of the disconnection and the disposition of shared data,
including purging and overwriting sensitive data. The disconnection should be
conducted when the impact on users is minimal. Following the disconnection, each
organization should update its system security plan and related documents.

6.3.1 Emergency Disconnection
    If one or both organizations detect an attack, intrusion attempt, or other
contingency that exploits or jeopardizes the connected systems or their data, it
might be necessary to abruptly terminate the interconnection without providing
written notice to the other party. This extraordinary measure should be taken only
in extreme circumstances and only after consultation with appropriate technical staff
and senior management.
    The decision to make the emergency disconnection should be made by the
system owner (or a designated staff member) and implemented by technical staff.
The system owner or designee should immediately notify the other party verbally
and receive confirmation of the notification. Both parties should work together to
isolate and investigate the incident, in accordance with incident response procedures.
If necessary, law enforcement authorities should be notified, and evidence should be
preserved.
    The initiating party should provide a written notification to the other party in a
timely manner (e.g., within five days). The notification should describe the nature of
the incident, explain why and how the interconnection was terminated, and identify
actions taken to isolate and investigate the incident. The notification should also
specify when and under what conditions the interconnection may be restored, if
appropriate.

6.3.2 Restoration of Interconnection
   Both organizations may choose to restore the system interconnection after it has
been terminated. The decision to restore the interconnection should be based on the
cause and duration of the disconnection. For example, if the interconnection was
terminated because of an attack, intrusion, or other contingency, both parties should
implement appropriate countermeasures to prevent a recurrence of the problem. If


                                                                                   52
CHAPTER 6                                                Interconnecting Systems


necessary, they also should modify the ISA and MOU/MOA to address issues
requiring attention. Alternately, if the interconnection has been terminated for more
than 90 days, each party should perform a risk assessment on its respective system
and reexamine all relevant planning and implementation requirements, including
developing a new ISA and MOU/MOA.
   Sample MOU/MOA and ISA Checklist follow.




                                                                                   53

Annex 6.A Sample MOU/MOA
This annex provides a sample MOU/MOA template that agencies can use as a starting point for
developing their own MOU/MOAs. This sample does not cover all possible scenarios and should
be used as an example only.


                      FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
    (MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING / MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT)

SUPERSEDES: (None or document title and date)

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this memorandum is to establish a management agreement
between “Organization A” and “Organization B” regarding the development, management,
operation, and security of a connection between "System A," owned by Organization A, and
"System B,” owned by Organization B. This agreement will govern the relationship between
Organization A and Organization B, including designated managerial and technical staff, in the
absence of a common management authority.

AUTHORITY The authority for this agreement is based on "Proclamation A" issued by the
Agency Head on (date).

BACKGROUND It is the intent of both parties to this agreement to interconnect the following
information technology (IT) systems to exchange data between "ABC database" and "XYZ
database." Organization A requires the use of Organization B's ABC database, and Organization
B requires the use of Organization A's XYZ database, as approved and directed by the Agency
Head in Proclamation A. The expected benefit of the interconnection is to expedite the processing
of data associated with "Project R" within prescribed timelines. Each information system is
described below:

   SYSTEM A
– Name
– Function
– Location
– Description of data, including sensitivity or classification level and security categorization/impact
  level

  SYSTEM B
– Name
– Function
– Location
– Description of data, including sensitivity or classification level and security categorization/impact
  level

COMMUNICATIONS

Frequent formal communications are essential to ensure the successful management and
operation of the interconnection. The parties agree to maintain open lines of communication
between designated staff at both the managerial and technical levels. All communications
described herein must be conducted in writing unless otherwise noted. The owners of System A
and System B agree to designate and provide contact information for technical leads for their
respective system, and to facilitate direct contacts between technical leads to support the
management and operation of the interconnection. To safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and




                                                                                                    54
CHAPTER 6                                                           Interconnecting Systems


availability of the connected systems and the data they store, process, and transmit, the parties
agree to provide notice of specific events within the time frames indicated below:

   Security Incidents: Technical staff will immediately notify their designated counterparts by
telephone or e-mail when a security incident(s) is detected, so the other party may take steps to
determine whether its system has been compromised and to take appropriate security
precautions. The system owner will receive formal notification in writing within five (5) business
days after detection of the incident(s).

  Disasters and Other Contingencies: Technical staff will immediately notify their designated
counterparts by telephone or e-mail in the event of a disaster or other contingency that disrupts
the normal operation of one or both of the connected systems.

   Material Changes to System Configuration: Planned technical changes to the system
architecture will be reported to technical staff before such changes are implemented. The
initiating party agrees to conduct a risk assessment based on the new system architecture and to
modify and re-sign the ISA within one (1) month of implementation.

  New Interconnections: The initiating party will notify the other party at least one (1) month
before it connects its information system with any other information system, including systems
that are owned and operated by third parties.

  Personnel Changes: The parties agree to provide notification of the separation or long-term
absence of their respective system owner or technical lead. In addition, both parties will provide
notification of any changes in point of contact information. Both parties also will provide
notification of changes to user profiles, including users who resign or change job responsibilities.

INTERCONNECTION SECURITY AGREEMENT

The technical details of the interconnection will be documented in an Interconnection Security
Agreement (ISA). The parties agree to work together to develop the ISA, which must be signed
by both parties before the interconnection is activated. Proposed changes to either system or the
interconnecting medium will be reviewed and evaluated to determine the potential impact on the
interconnection. The ISA will be renegotiated before changes are implemented. Signatories to the
ISA shall be the AO for each system.

SECURITY

Both parties agree to work together to ensure the joint security of the connected systems and the
data they store, process, and transmit, as specified in the ISA. Based on National Institute of
Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems, both parties should authorize all connections from the information
system to other information systems outside of that accreditation boundary and monitor and
control the system interconnections on an ongoing basis. Each party should identify security
controls that apply to the interconnection based on each system’s information security
categorization and impact level and agree on a mutual set of applicable controls. Each party
certifies that its respective system is designed, managed, and operated in compliance with all
relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies, and will ensure that appropriate security controls
are maintained throughout the life of this MOU/MOA.

PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS

Both parties agree to examine privacy issues related to data that will be exchanged or passed
over the interconnection and determine whether such use is restricted under current statutes,
regulations, or policies. Examples of data that might be restricted include personally identifiable
information such as names and social security numbers, or confidential business information


                                                                                                  55
CHAPTER 6                                                           Interconnecting Systems


such as contractor bid rates and trade secrets. Each party should consult with its Privacy Officer
or Legal Counsel to determine whether such information may be shared or transferred.
Permission to exchange or transfer data should be documented, along with a commitment to
protect such data.

COST CONSIDERATIONS

Both parties agree to equally share the costs of the interconnecting mechanism and/or media, but
no such expenditures or financial commitments shall be made without the written concurrence of
both parties. Modifications to either system that are necessary to support the interconnection are
the responsibility of the respective system owners’ organization.

TIMELINE

This agreement will remain in effect for one (1) year after the last date on either signature in the
signature block below. After one (1) year, this agreement will expire without further action. If the
parties wish to extend this agreement, they may do so by reviewing, updating, and reauthorizing
this agreement. The newly signed agreement should explicitly supersede this agreement, which
should be referenced by title and date. If one or both of the parties wish to terminate this
agreement prematurely, they may do so upon 30 days' advanced notice or in the event of a
security incident that necessitates an immediate response.

Chapter 7
7. Performance Measures
    A performance measures program provides numerous organizational and financial
benefits to federal agencies. Agencies can develop information security metrics that
measure the effectiveness of their security program, and provide data to be analyzed
and used by program managers and system owners to isolate problems, justify
investment requests, and target funds specifically to the areas in need of
improvement. By using metrics to target security investments, agencies can get the
best value from available resources. The typical information performance
management program consists of four interdependent components: senior
management support, security policies and procedures, quantifiable performance
metrics, and analyses.
    Strong senior management support establishes a focus on security within the
highest levels of the organization. Without a solid foundation (e.g., proactive support
of those persons in positions that control information resources), the effectiveness of
the security metrics program can fail when pressured by politics and budget
limitations. The second component of an effective security metrics program is
practical security policies and procedures backed by the authority necessary to
enforce compliance. Metrics are not easily obtainable in the absence of policies and
procedures. The third component is developing and establishing quantifiable
performance metrics that are designed to capture and provide meaningful
performance data. To provide meaningful data, quantifiable security metrics must be
based on information security performance goals and objectives, and be easily
obtainable, repeatable, relevant, useful, and measurable. Finally, the security
metrics program itself must emphasize consistent, periodic analysis of the metrics
data. The results of this analysis are used to apply lessons learned, improve the
effectiveness of existing security controls, and plan future controls to meet new
security requirements as they occur. Accurate data collection must be a priority with
stakeholders and users if the collected data is to be meaningful to the management
and improvement of the overall security program.
    A number of existing laws, rules, and regulations cite information technology (IT)
performance measurement in general and information security performance
measurement in particular, as requirements. These laws include the Clinger-Cohen
Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Government Paperwork
Elimination Act (GPEA), and the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA).
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides
guidance on how an organization, by using metrics, identifies the adequacy of in-
place security controls, policies, and procedures. It provides an approach to help
management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or
how to identify and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metrics
development and implementation process and how it can also be used to adequately
justify security control investments. The results of an effective metrics program can
provide useful data for directing the allocation of information security resources and
should simplify the preparation of performance-related reports.




                                                                                    59
CHAPTER 7                                                                   Performance Measures


    Fiscal constraints and market conditions compel government and industry to
operate on reduced budgets. In such an environment, it is difficult to justify broad
investments in the information security infrastructure. Historically, arguments for
investing in specific areas of information security lack detail and specificity and fail to
adequately mitigate specific system risk. Information security metrics can facilitate
the capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process by providing quantifiable
information for business case development. 46 Information security metrics can also
assist with determining the effectiveness of implemented information security
processes, procedures, and controls by relating results of information security
activities (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to the respective
requirements and to information security investments.
    Departments and agencies can also demonstrate compliance with applicable laws,
such as FISMA, rules, and regulations by implementing and maintaining an
information security metrics program as described in this handbook. Information
security metrics will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA reporting requirement by
providing an infrastructure for organized data collection, analysis, and reporting.
Information security metrics can also be used as input into the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) audits.

7.1 Metric Types
   Metrics are tools that support decision making. Like experience, external
mandates, and strategies, metrics are one element of a manager’s toolkit for making
and substantiating decisions. Metrics are used to answer three basic questions:
       •   “Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?” Consider the
           example of a program manager with responsibility for 250 information
           systems. Among other things, that manager is responsible for the security
           certification and accreditation of those systems. A commonly used
           implementation metric for security certification and accreditation is the
           percentage of systems accredited.
       •   “How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?” Such metrics
           often answer more complex questions after an activity is fully implemented.
           For example, federal law requires that security certification and accreditation
           take place following a major system change. One might measure the
           efficiency of a security certification and accreditation program by determining
           the time lag between each major system change and that system’s renewed
           accreditation. Or one might measure the effectiveness of a security
           certification and accreditation program by determining the number of
           accredited systems whose certification process included the creation of a
           system security plan.
       •   “What impact are those tasks having on the mission?” Activities are initially
           selected with the belief that they will contribute to the mission. After an
           activity is shown to be fully implemented, managers must validate that the
           activity is delivering the expected benefit. These metrics are the most difficult
           to generate. A security certification and accreditation process may prove to
           have an impact by showing that fewer interruptions or losses of data due to
           security incidents are experienced among correctly accredited systems than
           among incorrectly accredited or nonaccredited systems.

CHAPTER 7                                                     Performance Measures


7.2 Metrics Development and Implementation Approach
   Two processes guide the establishment and operation of an information security
metrics program: metrics development and metrics implementation. The metrics
development process establishes the initial set of metrics and selection of the metrics
subset appropriate for an organization at a given time. The metrics program
implementation process operates a metrics program that is iterative by nature and
ensures that appropriate aspects of information security are measured for a specific
time period.

7.3 Metrics Development Process
   Figure 7-1 illustrates the place of information security metrics within a larger
organizational context and demonstrates that information security metrics can be
used to progressively measure implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and the
business impact of information security activities within organizations or for specific
systems.




              Figure 7-1. Information Security Metrics Development Process


    The information security metrics development process consists of two major
activities:
       1. Identifying and defining the current information security program; and
       2. Developing and selecting specific metrics to measure implementation,
           efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the security controls.
    The process steps do not need to be sequential. Rather, the process illustrated in
Figure 7-1 provides a framework for thinking about metrics and aids in identifying
metrics to be developed for each system. The type of metric depends on where the
system is within its life cycle and on the maturity of the information system security
program. This framework facilitates tailoring metrics to a specific organization and to
the different stakeholder groups present within each organization.



                                                                                      61
CHAPTER 7                                                                    Performance Measures


    Phases 5, 6, and 7, depicted in Figure 7-1, involve developing metrics that
measure process implementation, effectiveness and efficiency, and mission impact.
The specific aspect of information security that metrics will focus on at any given
point will depend on information security program maturity. Implementation
evidence, required to prove higher levels of effectiveness, will change from
establishing existence of policy and procedures to quantifying implementation of
these policies and procedures, then to quantifying results of implementation of
policies and procedures, and ultimately to identifying the impact of implementation
on the organization’s mission.
    Based on existing policies and procedures, the universe of possible metrics can
be prohibitively large; therefore, agencies should prioritize metrics to ensure that the
final set selected for initial implementation has the following attributes:
       • Facilitates improvement of high-priority security control implementation. High
         priority may be defined by the latest GAO or IG reports, results of a risk
         assessment, or an internal organizational goal;
       • Uses data that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data
         repositories; and
       • Measures processes that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring
         nonexistent or unstable processes will not provide meaningful information
         about security performance and will therefore not be useful for targeting
         specific aspects of performance. On the other hand, attempting such
         measurement may not be entirely useless, because such a metric will certainly
         produce poor results and will therefore identify an area that needs
         improvement.
    Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including security certification
and accreditation, security assessments, plan of action and milestones (POA&M),
incident statistics, and agency-initiated or independent reviews. 47 Agencies may
decide to use a weighting scale to differentiate the importance of selected metrics
and to ensure that the results accurately reflect existing security program priorities.
This process would involve assigning values to each metric based on the importance
of a metric in the context of the overall security program. Metrics weighting should
be based on the overall risk mitigation goals, is likely to reflect higher criticality of
department-level initiatives versus smaller-scale initiatives, and is a useful tool that
facilitates integration of information security into the departmental capital planning
process.
    A phased approach may be required to identify short-, mid-, and long-term
metrics in which the implementation time frame depends on a combination of
system-level effectiveness, metric priority, data availability, and process stability.
Once applicable metrics that contain the qualities described above are identified,
they will need to be documented with supporting detail, including frequency of data
collection, data source, formula for calculation, implementation evidence for
measured activity, and a guide for metric data interpretation. Other information
about each metric can be defined based on an organization’s processing and
business requirements.

7.4 Metrics Program Implementation
   Information security metrics should be used for monitoring information security
control performance and initiating performance improvement actions. This iterative
process consists of six phases, depicted in Figure 7-2.




        Figure 7-2. Information Security Metrics Program Implementation Process

7.4.1   Prepare for Data Collection
    Phase 1 of the process, Prepare for Data Collection, involves activities that are
key for establishing a comprehensive information security metrics program. These
activities include the information security metrics identification, definition,
development, and selection activities, and developing a metrics program
implementation plan.
    After the metrics have been identified, specific implementation steps should be
defined on how to collect, analyze, and report the metrics. These steps should be
documented in the metrics program implementation plan. The following items may
be included in the plan:
   • Metrics roles and responsibilities, including responsibilities for data collection
     (both soliciting and submitting), analysis, and reporting;
   • An audience for the plan;
   • Process of metrics collection, analysis, and reporting that is tailored to the
     specific organizational structure, processes, policies, and procedures;
   • Details of coordination with the chief information officer (CIO), such as with risk
     assessment, security certification and accreditation, and FISMA reporting
     activities;
   • Details of coordination between the CIO and other functions within the agency,
     external to the CIO (e.g., Information Assurance (IA), if separate from the CIO;
     physical security; personnel security; and critical infrastructure protection
     [CIP]) to ensure that the metrics data collection is streamlined and
     nonintrusive;
   • Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools;


                                                                                          63
CHAPTER 7                                                       Performance Measures


   • Modifications of data collection and tracking tools; and
   • Metrics summary reporting formats.

7.4.2   Collect Data and Analyze Results
    Phase 2 of the process, Collect Data and Analyze Results, involves activities that
are essential for ensuring that the collected metrics are used to gain an
understanding of system security and to identify appropriate improvement actions.
This phase includes the following activities:
   • Collect metrics data according to the processes defined in the metrics program
     implementation plan;
   • Consolidate collected data and store in a format (i.e., a database or a
     spreadsheet) conducive to data analysis and reporting;
   • Conduct gap analysis, compare collected measurements with targets if defined,
     and identify gaps between actual and desired performance;
   • Identify causes of poor performance; and
   • Identify areas requiring improvement.
    The causes of poor performance can often be identified using the data from more
than one metric. For example, determining that the percentage of approved security
plans is unacceptably low would not be helpful for determining how to correct the
problem. To determine the cause of low compliance, collect information on the
reasons for low percentages (e.g., lack of guidance, insufficient expertise, or
conflicting priorities). This information can be collected as separate metrics or as
implementation evidence for the percentage of approved security plans. Once this
information is collected and compiled, the agency should develop a correction plan to
address the root cause of the problem.
   Root causes for faulty security run the gamut between highly technical
misconfiguration issues to lack of training or outdated policies or practices. Below
are examples of causation factors that contribute to poor security control
implementation and effectiveness:
   • Resources—insufficient human, monetary, or other resources;
   • Training—lack of appropriate training for the personnel installing, administering,
     maintaining, or using the systems;
   • System Upgrades—security patches that have been removed but not replaced
     during the operating system upgrades;
   • Configuration Management (CM) Practices—new or upgraded systems that are
     not configured with required security settings and patches;
   • Software Compatibility—security patches or upgrades that are incompatible
     with software applications supported by the system;
   • Awareness and Commitment—lack of management awareness and/or
     commitment to security;
   • Policies and Procedures—lack of policies and procedures that are required to
     ensure existence, use, and audit of required security functions;
   • Architectures—poor system and security architectures that make systems
     vulnerable; and




                                                                                       64
CHAPTER 7                                                                   Performance Measures


       • Inefficient Processes—inefficient planning and communication processes that
         influence the metrics.

7.4.3      Identify Corrective Actions
   Phase 3 of the process, Identify Corrective Actions, involves developing a plan
that will provide the roadmap of how to close the implementation gap identified in
Phase 2. This phase includes the following activities:
       • Determine Range of Corrective Actions. Based on the results and causation
         factors, identify corrective actions that could be applied to each performance
         issue. Corrective actions may include changing system configurations; training
         security staff, system administrator staff, or regular users; purchasing security
         tools; changing system architecture; establishing new processes and
         procedures; and updating security policies.
       • Prioritize Corrective Actions Based on Overall Risk Mitigation Goals.
         Several corrective actions may be applicable to a single performance issue;
         however, some may be inappropriate if they are inconsistent with the
         magnitude of the problem or are too costly. Applicable corrective actions
         should be prioritized for each performance issue in the ascending order of cost
         and descending order of impact. The risk management process, described in
         NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems,
         should be used for prioritizing corrective actions. 48 If weights were assigned to
         metrics in Phase 1, Prepare for Data Collection, they should be used to
         prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively, weights may be assigned to
         corrective actions in Phase 3, Identify Corrective Actions, based on the
         criticality of implementing specific corrective actions, the cost of corrective
         actions, and the magnitude of corrective actions’ impact on the organization’s
         security posture.
       • Select Most Appropriate Corrective Actions. Up to three corrective actions
         from the top of the list of prioritized corrective actions should be selected for
         conducting a full cost-benefit analysis. These selections should then be
         appropriately reflected in the agency or system POA&Ms.

7.4.4      Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources
    Phases 4 and 5, Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources, respectively,
address the budgeting cycle required for obtaining resources needed for
implementing the remediation actions identified in Phase 3. The steps to develop a
business case are based on industry practices and mandated guidance, including
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and
GPRA. The results of the prior three phases will be included in the business case as
supporting evidence. NIST SP 800-55 provides guidance on security practitioners’
inputs into the CPIC process and on their role in core development.
   Each agency should follow agency-specific business case guidance during this
phase. Typically, the components and analysis of the business facilitate the
completion of internal and external budget requests. A thorough examination of the
business case will support and facilitate the obtaining resources process.

     Assessments, of this guide for additional guidance on prioritizing corrective actions.



                                                                                                        65
CHAPTER 7                                                    Performance Measures


7.4.5    Apply Corrective Actions
    Phase 6 of the process, Apply Corrective Actions, involves implementing
corrective actions as determined through data analysis and as defined in an
applicable business case or a POA&M. After corrective actions are applied, the cycle
completes itself and restarts with subsequent data collection and analysis. Iterative
data collection, analysis, and reporting will track the progress of corrective actions
through the POA&M, among others, measure improvement, and identify areas for
further improvement to be included in tactical plans, Program Management Plans, or
other agency planning mechanisms. The iterative nature of the cycle ensures that
the progress is monitored, and the corrective actions are affecting system security
control implementation in an intended way. Frequent performance measurements
will ensure that if corrective actions are not implemented as planned, or if their
actual effect is not the desired effect, quick course corrections can be made
internally by the agency, thus avoiding the unveiling of problems during external
audits, security certification and accreditation efforts, or other similar activities.

Chapter 8
8. Security Planning
    Today’s rapidly changing technical environment requires that federal agencies
adopt a minimum set of security controls to protect their information and information
systems. The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the
security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. The system security plan also delineates responsibilities
and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system. It should reflect
input from various managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including
information owners, the system owner, and the senior agency information security
officer (SAISO). Agencies, at their discretion, can include additional information in
the basic plan and add sections to the basic format prescribed herein, as long as the
major sections described in this document are adequately covered and readily
identifiable.
    Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization
must understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the
information system and those responsible for defining system requirements should
also be familiar with the system security planning process, as the system security
plan is an important deliverable in the system development life cycle (SDLC)
process. 49 Those responsible for implementing and managing information systems
must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their systems.
    Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies the
minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems in
seventeen security-related areas. Federal agencies must meet the minimum security
requirements defined in FIPS 200 by using the security controls in National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended
Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-18 Rev.1, Guide
for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, which provides a
Systems Security Plan Template in Appendix A of the document. The guidance below
provides basic information on how to prepare a system security plan in accordance
with applicable federal requirements, and it is easily adaptable to a variety of
organizational structures.

8.1 Major Applications, General Support Systems, and Minor Applications
    All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled
as a major application (MA) 50 or general support system (GSS). 51 Specific system



49
   See NIST Publication 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life
   Cycle, and Chapter 3, System Development Life Cycle, of this guide for additional guidance on the
   SDLC.
50
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines major application as an
   application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting
   from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application.
51
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines general support system as an interconnected set of
   information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. It
   normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and people.



                                                                                                        67
CHAPTER 8                                                                         Security Planning


security plans for minor applications 52 are not required because the security controls
for those applications are typically provided by the GSS or MA in which they operate.
In those cases where the minor application is not connected to an MA or GSS, the
minor application should be briefly described in a GSS plan that either has a common
physical location or is supported by the same organization.

8.2   Security Planning Roles and Responsibilities
    Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process. System
security plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and
plans of action and milestones (POA&M) for implementing security controls.
Procedures should be in place outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan
current, and follows up on planned security controls. In addition, procedures should
require that system security plans be developed and reviewed prior to proceeding
with the security certification and accreditation process for the system.
   During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security
plan is analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the
security controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS
199 security category determined for the information system, and that the threat
and vulnerability identification and initial risk determination is identified and
documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document.
The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks, develop the
POA&Ms that are required to track remedial actions, and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security
accreditation decision. 53
    The roles and responsibilities in this section are specific to information system
security planning. Recognizing that agencies have widely varying missions and
organizational structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for
security planning-related roles and how the associated responsibilities are allocated
among agency personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one
individual filling multiple roles). 54,55

8.2.1 Chief Information Officer
   The chief information officer (CIO) 56 is the agency official responsible for
developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program and has
the following system security planning responsibilities:



52
   NIST SP 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than major application, that
   requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
   unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications are
   typically included as part of a GSS.
53
   See NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
   Systems, and Chapter 11, Certification and Accreditation, of this guide for additional guidance on the
   C&A process.
54
   Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiple roles in the security planning process to
   ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts
   of interest.
55
   See Chapter 2, Governance, Chapter 5, Capital Planning, Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and
   Security Assessments, and Chapter 14, Configuration Management, of this guide for additional guidance
   on roles and responsibilities.
56
   When an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, the Federal Information Security
   Management Act (FISMA) requires the associated responsibilities to be handled by a comparable agency
   official.



                                                                                                        68
CHAPTER 8                                                                         Security Planning


     • Designating an SAISO who shall carry out the CIO's responsibilities for system
       security planning;
     • Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and
       control techniques to address system security planning;
     • Managing the identification, implementation, and assessment of common
       security controls;
     • Ensuring that personnel with significant responsibilities for system security
       plans are trained;
     • Assisting senior agency officials with their responsibilities for system security
       plans; and
     • Identifying and developing common security controls for the agency.

8.2.2   Information System Owner
    The information system owner 57 is the agency official responsible for the overall
procurement, development, integration, modification, and operation and
maintenance of the information system. The information system owner has the
following responsibilities related to system security plans:
     • Developing the system security plan in coordination with information owners,
       the system administrator, the information system security officer (ISSO), the
       SAISO, and functional "end users";
     • Maintaining the system security plan and ensuring that the system is deployed
       and operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements; and
     • Ensuring that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security
       training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior) and assisting in the
       identification, implementation, and assessment of the common security
       controls.

8.2.3   Information Owner
    The information owner is the agency official with statutory or operational
authority for specified information and is responsible for establishing the controls for
information generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The
information owner has the following responsibilities related to system security plans:
     • Establishing the rules for the appropriate use and protection of the subject
       data/information (rules of behavior); 58
     • Providing input to information system owners on the security requirements and
       security controls for the information systems where the information resides;
     • Deciding who has access to the information system and determining what types
       of privileges or access rights; and
     • Assisting in identifying and assessing the common security controls where the
       information resides.



57
   The role of the information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the
   particular agency and the SDLC phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to
   information system owners as program managers or business/asset/mission owners.
58
   The information owner retains that responsibility even when the data/information is shared with other
   organizations.



                                                                                                       69
CHAPTER 8                                                            Security Planning


8.2.4    Senior Agency Information Security Officer
     The SAISO is the agency official responsible for serving as the CIO’s primary
liaison to the agency’s information system owners and ISSOs. The SAISO has the
following responsibilities related to system security plans:
      • Carrying out the CIO’s responsibilities for system security planning;
      • Coordinating the development, review, and acceptance of system security plans
        with information system owners, ISSOs, and the authorizing official;
      • Coordinating the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common
        security controls; and
      • Possessing professional qualifications, including training and experience,
        required to develop and review system security plans.

8.2.5    Information System Security Officer
    The ISSO is the agency official assigned responsibility by the SAISO, authorizing
official, management official, or information system owner for ensuring that the
appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or
program. The ISSO has the following responsibilities related to system security
plans:
      • Assisting the SAISO in identifying, implementing, and assessing the common
        security controls; and
      • Actively supporting the development and maintenance of the system security
        plan, to include coordinating system changes with the information system
        owner and assessing the security impact of those changes.

8.3     Rules of Behavior
    The rules of behavior, which are required in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III,
and are also a form of security control found in NIST SP 800-53, should clearly
delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the
system. The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior or
noncompliance and be made available to every user prior to receiving authorization
for system access. It is required that the rules contain a signature page for each
user to acknowledge receipt, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree
to abide by the rules of behavior. Electronic signatures are acceptable for use in
acknowledging the rules of behavior.
    Table 8-1 lists examples from OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, of what should
be covered in typical rules of behavior. These are examples only and agencies have
flexibility in the detail and content. When developing the rules of behavior, agencies
should be aware that the intended function of this document is to make all users
accountable for their actions by acknowledging that they have read, understood, and
agreed to abide by the rules of behavior. The rules, while not intended as a complete
copy of the security policy or procedures guide, should cover, at a high level, some
of the controls described in Table 8-1. Lastly, agencies can incorporate, by reference,
the agency body of policies and procedures governing information security and other
applicable policies in the text of the rules of behavior.




                                                                                     70
CHAPTER 8                                                                                      Security Planning


                                   Table 8-1. Rules of Behavior Examples
                             Examples of Controls Contained in Rules of Behavior
 Delineate responsibilities, expected use of system, and behavior of all users
 Describe appropriate limits on interconnections
 Define service provisions and restoration priorities
 Be clear on consequences of behavior not consistent with rules
 Covers the following topics:
   − Work at home                          − Unofficial use of government equipment
   − Dial-in access                        − Assignment and limitations of system privileges and individual accountability
   − Connection to the Internet            − Password usage
   − Use of copyrighted work               − Searching databases and divulging information


8.4 System Security Plan Approval
   Organizational policy should clearly define who is responsible for system security
plan approval and procedures developed for plan submission, including any special
memorandum language or other documentation required by the agency. Prior to the
security certification and accreditation process, the authorizing official, independent
from the system owner, typically approves the plan.

8.4.1 System Boundary Analysis and Security Controls
     Before the system security plan can be developed, the information system and
the information resident within that system must be categorized based on a FIPS 199
impact analysis. 59 Then a determination can be made as to which systems in the
inventory can be logically grouped into GSSs or MAs. The FIPS 199 impact levels
must be considered when the system boundaries are drawn and when selecting the
initial set of security controls (e.g., control baseline). The baseline security controls
can then be tailored based on an assessment of risk and local conditions, including
organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit
analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.
Common security controls, which is one of the tailoring considerations, must be
identified prior to system security plan preparation to identify those controls covered
at the agency level that are not system-specific. These common security controls can
then be incorporated into the system security plan by reference. Figure 8-1 depicts
how large GSSs can be broken down for the purpose of security planning.
    The process of uniquely assigning information resources 60 to an information
system defines the security boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility
in determining what constitutes an information system (i.e., MA or GSS). If a set of
information resources is identified as an information system, the resources should
generally be under the same direct management control. Direct management
control 61 does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening management. It is
also possible for an information system to contain multiple subsystems. A subsystem
is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of
information, information technology (IT), and personnel that perform one or more
specific functions.

59
   See NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
   Categories, for supporting guidance on system categorization.
60
   Information resources consist of information and related resources such as personnel, equipment,
   funds, and information technology.
61
   Direct management control typically involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and
   associated responsibility. For new information systems, management control can be interpreted as
   having budgetary/programmatic authority and responsibility for developing and deploying the
   information systems. For information systems currently in the federal inventory, management control
   can be interpreted as having budgetary/operational authority for the day-to-day operation and
   maintenance of the information systems.

CHAPTER 8                                                                            Security Planning


8.4.2 Security Controls
    FIPS 200 provides seventeen minimum security requirements for federal
information and information systems. The requirements represent a broad-based,
balanced information security program that addresses the management, operational,
and technical aspects of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
federal information and information systems. An agency must meet the minimum
security requirements in this standard by applying security controls selected in
accordance with NIST SP 800-53 and the designated impact levels of the information
systems. An agency has the flexibility to tailor the security control baseline in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the standard. Tailoring
activities include (1) the application of scoping guidance, (2) the specification of
compensating controls, and (3) the specification of agency-defined parameters in the
security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should document all
tailoring activities.

8.4.3 Scoping Guidance
    Subsystems typically fall under the same management authority and are included
within a single system security plan. Figure 8-1 depicted a GSS with three
subsystems. Scoping guidance provides an agency with specific terms and
conditions on the applicability and implementation of individual security controls in
the security control baselines defined in NIST SP 800-53. Several considerations
described below can potentially impact how the baseline security controls are applied
by the agency. System security plans should clearly identify which security controls
used scoping guidance and include a description of the type of considerations that
were made. The application of scoping guidance must be reviewed and approved by
the authorizing official for the information system.

8.4.4 Compensating Controls
    Compensating security controls are the management, operational, or technical
controls used by an agency in lieu of prescribed controls in the low, moderate, or
high security control baselines, which provide equivalent or comparable protection
for an information system. Compensating security controls for an information system
will be used by an agency only under the following conditions: (1) the agency selects
the compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST SP 800-53, (2)
the agency provides a complete and convincing rationale and justification for how the
compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection
for the information system, and (3) the agency assesses and formally accepts the
risk associated with using the compensating controls in the information system. The
use of compensating security controls must be reviewed, documented in the system
security plan, and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

8.4.5 Common Security Controls
    An agency-wide view of the information security program facilitates the
identification of common security controls that can be applied to one or more agency
information systems. Common security controls can apply to (1) all agency
information systems; (2) a group of information systems at a specific site
(sometimes associated with the term site certification/accreditation); or (3) common
information systems, subsystems, or applications (i.e., common hardware, software,
and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational sites (sometimes associated with
the term type certification/accreditation). Common security controls—typically
identified during a collaborative agency-wide process that involves the CIO, SAISO,
authorizing officials, information system owners, and ISSOs (and by developmental
program managers in the case of common security controls for common hardware,
software, and/or firmware)—have the following properties:
   • The development, implementation, and assessment of common security
     controls can be assigned to responsible agency officials or organizational
     elements (other than the information system owners whose systems will
     implement or use those common security controls).
   • The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used
     to support the security certification and accreditation processes of agency
     information systems where those controls have been applied.
   For efficiency in developing system security plans, common security controls
should be documented once and then inserted or imported into each system security
plan for the information systems within the agency. Effectively maximizing the
application of common controls in the system security planning process depends on
the following factors:

   • The agency has developed, documented, and communicated its specific
     guidance on identifying common security controls.
   • The agency has assigned the responsibility for coordinating common security
     control identification and review and obtaining consensus on the common
     control designations with a management official, such as the CIO or SAISO,
     with security program responsibilities.
   • System owners have been briefed on the system security planning process,
     including use of common controls.




                                                                                   73
CHAPTER 8                                                                              Security Planning


     • Agency experts in the common control areas identified have been consulted as
       part of the process.
    While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls
and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this
principle within an agency takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an
agency is just beginning to implement this approach or has only partially
implemented this approach, it may take some time to get the maximum benefits
from security control partitioning and the associated reuse of assessment evidence.
Because of the potential dependence on common security controls by many of an
agency's information systems, a failure of such common controls may result in a
significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that arises from operating the systems
that depend on these security controls.

8.5 Security Control Selection
    An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 199 by
selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described
in NIST SP 800-53. The process of selecting the appropriate security controls and
assurance requirements for agency information systems to achieve adequate
security 62 is a multifaceted, risk-based activity involving management and
operational personnel within the agency. Security categorization of federal
information and information systems, as required by FIPS 199, is the first step in the
risk management process. 63 Subsequent to the security categorization process, an
agency must select an appropriate set of security controls for their information
systems that satisfy the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS 200. The
selected set of security controls must be one of three security control baselines from
NIST SP 800-53 (see Table 8-2) that are associated with the designated impact
levels of the agency information systems as determined during the security
categorization process.
     • For low-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum, use the
       security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
       800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated
       with the low baseline are satisfied.
     • For moderate-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum,
       employ the security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
       defined in NIST SP 800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance
       requirements associated with the moderate baseline are satisfied.
     • For high-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum, use the
       security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
       800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated
       with the high baseline are satisfied.




62
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines adequate security as security commensurate with the risk
   and the magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of
   information.
63
   Security categorization must be accomplished as an enterprise-wide activity with the involvement of
   senior-level organizational officials including, but not limited to, CIOs, SAISOs, authorizing officials (also
   known as accreditation authorities), information system owners, and information owners. NIST SP 800-
   60 provides implementation guidance for FIPS 199.

8.6 Completion and Approval Dates
    The completion date of the system security plan should be provided. The
completion date should be updated whenever the plan is periodically reviewed and
updated. The system security plan should also contain the date the authorizing
official or the designated approving authority approves the plan. Approval
documentation, e.g., accreditation letter, should be on file or attached as part of the
plan.

8.7 Ongoing System Security Plan Maintenance
    Once the information system security plan is accredited, it is important to
periodically assess the plan; review any change in system status, functionality,
design, etc.; and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information
about the system. This documentation and its accuracy are imperative for system
recertification and reaccreditation activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated,
if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include in the review are:
     • Change in information system owner;
     • Change in information security representative;
     • Major change in system architecture;
     • Change in system status;
     • Additions/deletions of system interconnections;
     • Change in system scope; and
     • Change in authorizing official.


                                                                                                                        75
CHAPTER 8                                                         Security Planning


    The objective of system security planning is to improve the protection of
information system resources. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and
require protection as part of good management practice. The protection of a system
must be documented in a system security plan. The completion of system security
plans is a requirement of the OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal
Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources, and Title III of the E-Government Act, FISMA.
   For the plans to adequately reflect the protection of the resources, a senior
management official must authorize a system to process information or operate. This
authorization provides an important quality control. By authorizing processing in a
system, the manager accepts its associated risk.
    Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management,
operational, and technical controls. Since the system security plan establishes and
documents the security controls, it should form the basis for the authorization,
supplemented by the assessment report and the POA&Ms. In addition, a periodic
review of controls should also contribute to future authorizations. Reauthorization
should occur prior to a significant change in processing, but at least every three
years.

9. Information Technology
   Contingency Planning
    Information technology (IT) contingency planning is one modular piece of a
larger contingency and continuity of operations (COOP) planning process that
encompasses IT, business processes, risk management, financial management, crisis
communications, safety and security of personnel and property, and continuity of
government. Each piece is operative in its own right, but in concert creates synergy
that efficiently and effectively protects the entire organization. 64
    Contingency planning for information systems is a required process for
developing general support systems (GSS) and major applications (MA) with
appropriate backup methods and procedures for implementing data recovery and
reconstitution against IT risks. 65 Risks to information systems may be natural,
technological, or human in nature. Contingency planning consists of a process for
recovery and documentation of procedures for conducting recovery. National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34,
Contingency Planning for Information Technology Systems, details a seven-step
methodology for developing an IT contingency process and plan. Planning,
implementing, and testing the contingency strategy are addressed by six of the
seven steps; documenting the plan and establishing procedures and personnel
organization to implement the strategy is the final step. SP 800-34 also includes
technical considerations for developing recovery strategies.
   Figure 9-1 highlights contingency planning activities involved in each step that
should be addressed during all phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC). 66
    The capability to recover and reconstitute data should be integral to the
information system design concept during the Initiation phase. Recovery strategies
should be built into the GSS or MA’s architecture during the Development phase. The
contingency processes should be tested and maintained during the Implementation
phase; contingency plans should be exercised and maintained during the
Operations/Maintenance phase. When the information system has reached the
Disposal phase, the legacy system should remain intact and operational as a
contingency to the replaced information system until, at least, the new system has
been sufficiently tested. At some point, the legacy system may no longer support
the needs of the organization, and the recovery strategy may transition away from
the legacy system to a new recovery strategy designed during the Development
phase of the new system.

   All departments and agencies must have IT contingency plans for certified and accredited systems and
   must also have an organizational Continuity of Operations (COOP) plan for essential federal functions.

contingency planning policy within the organization. This policy may exist at the
department, agency, and/or program level of the organization. The statement should
define the organization’s overall contingency objectives; identify leadership, roles
and responsibilities, resource requirements, test, training, and exercise schedules;
and develop maintenance schedules and determine the minimum required backup
frequency.

before an unacceptable impact is experienced.
    The impact may be something that materializes over time or may be tracked
across related resources and dependent systems (e.g., cascading domino effect).
The time identified is called a maximum allowable outage (MAO). Based on the
potential impacts, the amount

CHAPTER 9                                                            Contingency Planning


can be without the critical resource then provides a recourse recovery priority around
which an organization can plan recovery activities. The balancing point between the
MAO and the cost to recover establishes the information system’s recovery time
objective (RTO). Recovery strategies must be created to meet the RTO.
   The strategy must also address recovering information system critical
components within a priority, as established by their individual RTOs.
9.3 Step 3: Identify Preventive Controls
   In some cases, implementing preventive controls might mitigate outage impacts
identified by the BIA. Preventive controls are measures that detect, deter, and/or
reduce impacts to the system. When cost-effective, preventing an impact is desired
over implementing recovery strategies (and therefore risking data loss and impact to
the organization). Preventive measures are specific to individual components and
the environment in which the components operate. Common controls include:
    • Uninterruptible power supply (UPS);
    • Fire suppression systems;
    • Gasoline or diesel-powered generators;
    • Air conditioning systems with excess capacity to permit failure of certain
      components;
    • Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital
    • nonelectronic records; and
    • Frequent, scheduled data backups.

within the RTO period. The recovery strategy is designed from a combination of
methods, which together address the full spectrum of information system risks.
Several options may be evaluated during the Development phase; the most cost-
effective option, based on potential impact, should be selected and integrated into
the information system architecture and operating procedures.

for conducting data backups.
The frequency of backup methods—daily or weekly, incremental or full—should be
selected based on system criticality when new information is introduced. The backup
method selected should be based on system and data availability and integrity
requirements (as defined in the BIA). Data that is backed up may need to be stored
offsite and rotated frequently, depending upon the criticality of the system.
    Major disruptions to system operations may require restoration activities to be
implemented at an alternate site. The type of alternate site selected must be based
on RTO requirements and budget limitations. Equipment for recovering and/or
replacing the information system must be provided as part of the recovery strategy.
Cost, delivery time, and compatibility factors must also be considered when



                                                                                                80
CHAPTER 9                                                        Contingency Planning


determining how to provide the necessary equipment. Agencies must also plan for
an alternate site that, at a minimum, provides workspace for all contingency plan
personnel, equipment, and the appropriate IT infrastructure necessary to execute IT
contingency plan and system recovery activities.
   The level of operational readiness of the alternate site is an important
characteristic to determine when developing the recovery strategy. NIST SP 800-34
provides an overview of the common types of alternate sites.
    The recovery strategy requires personnel to implement the procedures and test
operability. Generally, a member of the organization’s senior leadership is selected
to activate the plan and lead overall recovery operations. Appropriate teams of
personnel (at least two people to ensure there is a primary and alternate available to
execute procedures) are identified to be responsible for specific aspects of the plan.
    Personnel should be chosen to staff the teams based on their normal
responsibilities, system knowledge, and availability to recover the system on an on-
call basis. A line of succession should be defined to ensure that someone can
assume the role of senior leadership if the plan leader is unable to respond.
   Having selected choices for each component of the recovery strategy, the final
consideration should be given to cost. The recovery strategy must meet criticality,
availability, and RTO requirements while remaining within budget. Less obvious
costs—such as shipping, awareness programs, tests and exercises, travel, labor
hours, and contracted services—must also be incorporated into the evaluation.

9.5 Step 5: Develop IT Contingency Plan
   Procedures for executing the recovery strategy are outlined in the IT contingency
plan. The plan must be written in a format that will provide the users (recovery
team leadership and members) the context in which the plan is to be implemented
and the direct procedures, based on role, to execute. IT contingency plans are
constructed using five components as depicted in Figure 9-2.




                        Figure 9-2. Contingency Plan Structure

    The procedures are documented in the Notification/Activation Phase, Recovery
Phase, and Reconstitution Phase components of the plan. The Supporting
Information and Appendices components provide supplemental information



                                                                                      81
CHAPTER 9                                                       Contingency Planning


necessary to understand the context in which the plan is to be used and gives
additional information that may be necessary to execute procedures (e.g.,
emergency contact information and the BIA).

9.6 Step 6: Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises
   Personnel selected to execute the IT contingency plan must be trained to perform
the procedures, the plan must be exercised, and the system strategy must be tested.
      Plan testing should include:
      • System recovery on an alternate             • System performance using
        platform from backup media                    alternate equipment
      • Coordination among recovery teams           • Restoration of normal operations
      • Internal and external connectivity          • Notification procedures.

      Personnel training should include:
      • Purpose of the plan                         • Security requirements
      • Cross-team coordination and                 • Team-specific processes
        communication                               • Individual responsibilities.
      • Reporting procedures

    Plan exercises should be designed to individually and then collectively examine
various components of the entire plan. Exercises may be conducted in a classroom
setting: discussing specific components of the plan and/or impact issues; or they
may be functional exercises: simulating the recovery using actual replacement
equipment, data, and alternate sites.

9.7      Step 7: Plan Maintenance
     The IT contingency plan must always be maintained in a ready state for use
immediately upon notification. Periodic reviews of the plan must be conducted for
currency of key personnel and vendor information, system components and
dependencies, the recovery strategy, vital records, and operational requirements.
While some changes may be obvious (e.g., personnel turnover or vendor changes),
others will require analysis. The BIA should be reviewed periodically and updated
with new information to identify new contingency requirements and priorities.
Changes made to the plan are noted in a record of changes, dated, and signed or
initialed by the person making the change. The revised plan, or plan sections, are
circulated to those with plan responsibilities. Because of the impact that plan
changes may have on interdependent business processes or information systems,
the changes must be clearly communicated and properly annotated in the beginning
of the document.

Chapter 10
10. Risk Management
    An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful
information security program. The principal goal of an organization’s risk
management process is to protect the organization and its ability to perform its
mission, not just its information assets. Therefore, the risk management process
should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the information
security experts who operate and manage the information security system, but as an
essential management function of the organization that is tightly woven into the
system development life cycle (SDLC), 67 as depicted in Figure 10-1. Because risk
cannot be eliminated entirely, the risk management process allows information
security program managers to balance the operational and economic costs of
protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability. By employing practices
and procedures designed to foster informed decision making, agencies help protect
their information systems and the data that support their own mission.

     Risk management is an aggregation of three processes that have their roots in
several federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, including the Computer Security Act
of 1987, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, and National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems. The three processes are risk assessment, risk
mitigation, and evaluation and assessment. If applied appropriately and with due
diligence, this process meets the FISMA requirements of “providing information
security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm
resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of…information…and…information systems” collected by and used by the
federal government, and “ensuring that information security management processes
are integrated with agency strategic and operational planning processes.”

10.1 Risk Assessment
     To understand the risk assessment process, it is essential to define the term risk.
NIST SP 800-30 defines risk as “a function of the likelihood of a given threat source’s
exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that
adverse event on the organization.” In other words, where a threat intersects with a
vulnerability, risk is present. With this definition of risk in mind, the goal of the risk
assessment process is to identify and assess the risks to a given environment. The
depth of the risk assessment performed can vary greatly and is determined by the
criticality and sensitivity of the system, as applied to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, a process which is described in detail in Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 199. To meet the goal of the risk assessment, a nine-step process
is defined in NIST SP 800-30 and summarized here. To simplify the process
somewhat, the nine-step process described in NIST SP 800-30 is reduced to a six-



                                                                                       85
CHAPTER 10                                                             Risk Management

step process, whereby Steps 4, 5, and 6 of the process are combined to create the
Risk Analysis step (see Figures 10-2 and 10-3). Depicted in Figure 10-2, below, is a
high-level depiction of risk assessment process.
    The likelihood of a given threat successfully exploiting a given vulnerability is
estimated by evaluating the threat source’s motivation, opportunity, and methods for
conducting such an exploitation. The impact of a successful exploitation is estimated
through an analysis of the effect the exploitation can have on the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the system and the data it processes. The determination
of the criticality and sensitivity of the system, in terms of its confidentiality, integrity,
and availability, is found by applying the concepts and processes discussed in detail
within FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems.
   As mandated by OMB Circular A-130, the risk assessment process is usually
repeated at least every three years for federal agencies. However, risk assessments
should be conducted and integrated into the SDLC for information systems, not
because it is required by law or regulation, but because it is a good practice and
supports the organization’s business objectives or mission.

10.1.1 Step 1 – System Characterization
   Characterizing an information system establishes the scope of the risk
assessment effort, delineates the operational authorization (or accreditation)
boundaries, and provides information (e.g., hardware, software, system connectivity,
and responsible division or support personnel). This step begins with the
identification of the information system boundaries, resources, and information.
    When characterizing the system, the mission criticality and sensitivity (as
previously identified using FIPS 199 to determine the system’s appropriate security
categorization) are described in sufficient terms to form a basis for the scope of the
risk assessment. The level of effort and the granularity (i.e., the level of depth to
which the assessment investigates the security of the system) of the risk assessment
are based on the FIPS 199 security categorization. For example, a system
determined to be of low impact may not require hands-on security testing and
evaluation. Various techniques, such as questionnaires, interviews, documentation
reviews, and automated scanning tools, can be used to collect the information




                                                                                          86
CHAPTER 10                                                          Risk Management


needed to fully characterize the system. At a minimum, the system characterization
describes the following individual system components:
   • Hardware (e.g., IBM mainframe running the z/OS operating system, Dell server
     running Windows 2003);
   • Software (e.g., Oracle, Apache web server, Microsoft Internet Information
     Server [IIS]);
   • External interfaces to other systems;
   • Data; and
   • People.
   In addition to the component descriptions, the system characterization describes
other factors with the potential to affect the security of the system, such as:
   • System functional requirements;
   • Organizational security policy and architecture;
   • System network topology;
   • Information flows throughout the system;
   • Management, operational, and technical security controls implemented or
     planned to be implemented for the system; and
   • Physical and environmental security mechanisms.
    The accuracy of the results from this step is essential to obtaining the best view
of the risk profile of the system undergoing assessment, since this step provides the
basis for the remaining steps. Inaccuracy at this point will propagate and lead to a
cascade of analytical errors as the process progresses.

10.1.2 Step 2 – Threat Identification
    Threat identification consists of identifying threat sources with the potential to
exploit weaknesses in the system. This step should culminate in the development of
a “threat statement,” or a comprehensive listing of potential threat sources. The
threat statement must be tailored to the individual organization and its processing
environment (e.g., end-user computing habits), which is accomplished by performing
a threat evaluation, using the system characterization as the basis, for the potential
to cause harm to the system.
    There are common threat sources that typically apply, regardless of the system,
that should be evaluated. These common threats can be categorized into three
areas: (1) natural threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides,
avalanches, electrical storms), (2) human threats (intentional or unintentional), and
(3) environmental threats (e.g., power failure). In general, information on natural
threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms) should be readily available, as known
threats have been identified by many government and private sector organizations.
Intrusion detection tools also are becoming more prevalent, and government and
industry organizations continually collect data on security events, thereby improving
the ability to realistically assess threats. Sources of information include, but are not
limited to, the following:
   • Intelligence agencies (for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s
     National Infrastructure Protection Center);
   • United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) found at
     www.us-cert.gov); and
   • Mass media, including Web-based resources.




                                                                                      87
CHAPTER 10                                                          Risk Management


10.1.3 Step 3 – Vulnerability Identification
    NIST SP 800-30 defines vulnerability as “a flaw or weakness in system security
procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised
(accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a
violation of the system’s security policy.” Vulnerabilities can be identified using a
combination of a number of techniques and sources. Reviews of such sources as
previous risk assessments, audit reports, vulnerability lists [e.g., NIST National
Vulnerability Database (NVD), formerly known as I-CAT, found at nvd.nist.gov], and
security advisories can be used to begin the process of vulnerability identification.
System security testing, using methods such as automated vulnerability scanning
tools; security, test, and evaluation (ST&E); and penetration testing can be used to
augment the vulnerability source reviews and identify vulnerabilities that may not
have been previously identified in other sources.
    In addition, developing a security requirements checklist based on the security
requirements specified for the system during the conceptual, design, and
implementation phases of the SDLC can be used to provide a 360-degree inspection
of the system. The checklist can be developed using the guidance provided in NIST
SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information
Systems (draft), and NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems, to ensure the inclusion of appropriate questions in the areas of
management, operational, and technical security controls. The results of the
checklist (or questionnaire) can be used as input for evaluating compliance and
noncompliance, which in turn identifies system, process, and procedural weaknesses
that represent potential vulnerabilities.

10.1.4 Step 4 – Risk Analysis
    The risk analysis is a determination (or estimation) of risk to the system, an
analysis that requires the consideration of closely interwoven factors, such as the
security controls in place for the system under review, the likelihood that those
controls will be either insufficient or ineffective protection of the system, and the
impact of that failure. In other words, it is not possible to estimate the level of risk
posed by the successful exploitation of a given vulnerability without considering the
efficacy of the security controls that have been or are to be implemented to mitigate
or eliminate the potential for such an exploitation; nor the threat’s motivation,
opportunity, and capabilities, which contribute to the likelihood of a successful
attack; nor the impact to the system and organization should successful exploitation
of a vulnerability occur. The following four steps—control analysis, likelihood
determination, impact analysis, and risk determination—are, in a practical sense,
performed simultaneously or nearly simultaneously because they are so tightly linked
to each other.

10.1.4.1 Control Analysis
    As previously discussed, the analysis of controls in place to protect the system
can be accomplished using a checklist or questionnaire, which is based on the
security requirements for the system as specified by NIST SP 800-53. This analysis
can be refined using the NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls
in Federal Information Systems (draft), which provides guidance on testing security
controls extracted from NIST SP 800-53. The results are used to strengthen the
determination of the likelihood that a specific threat might successfully exploit a
particular vulnerability.



                                                                                      88
CHAPTER 10                                                         Risk Management


10.1.4.2 Likelihood Determination
    Likelihood determination considers a threat source’s motivation and capability to
exploit a vulnerability, the nature of the vulnerability, the existence of security
controls, and the effectiveness of mitigating security controls. Likelihood ratings are
described in the qualitative terms of high, moderate, and low, and are used to
describe how likely is a successful exploitation of a vulnerability by a given threat.
For example, if a threat is highly motivated and sufficiently capable, and controls
implemented to protect the vulnerability are ineffective, then it is highly likely that
the attack would be successful. In this scenario, the appropriate likelihood rating
would be high. The likelihood ratings of moderate and low are similarly defined to
successively lesser degrees.

10.1.4.3 Impact Analysis
     The third factor used in determining the level of risk to a system is impact. A
proper overall impact analysis considers the following factors: impact to the systems,
data, and the organization’s mission. Additionally, this analysis should also consider
the criticality and sensitivity of the system and its data. FIPS 199 provides a
consistent, focused process for categorizing a system’s criticality and sensitivity for
the three security domains of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Using FIPS
199 to determine a security category and applying an assessment of the system’s
and organization’s mission using tools such as mission-impact reports, asset
criticality assessment reports, and business impact analyses results in a rating
describing the estimated impact to the system and organization should a threat
successfully exploit a vulnerability. While impact can be described using either a
quantitative or qualitative approach, in the context of IT systems and data, impact is
generally described in qualitative terms. As with the ratings used to describe
likelihood, impact levels are described using the terms of high, moderate, and low.
NIST SP 800-30 provides definitions for the impact ratings of low, medium, and high.

10.1.4.4 Risk Determination
    Once the ratings for likelihood and impact have been determined through
appropriate analyses, the level of risk to the system and the organization can be
derived by multiplying the ratings assigned for threat likelihood (e.g., probability)
and threat impact. Table 10-1 shows how to calculate an overall risk rating using
inputs from the threat likelihood and impact categories using a 3X3 matrix.
Depending on the requirements of the system and the granularity of risk assessment
desired, 4x4 and 5x5 matrices may be used instead. The latter can include a Very
Low/Very High threat likelihood and a Very Low/Very High threat impact to generate
a Very Low/Very High risk level. A Very High risk level may require possible system
shutdown or stopping all information system integration and testing effort.

CHAPTER 10                                                                         Risk Management


                                   Table 10-1. Risk Level Matrix




Because the determination of risk ratings for impact and threat likelihood is largely
subjective, it is best to assign each rating a numeric value for ease of calculation.
The rationale for this justification can be explained in terms of the probability
assigned for each threat likelihood level and a value assigned for each impact level.
For example:
   • The probability assigned for each threat likelihood level is 1.0 for high, 0.5 for
     moderate, and 0.1 for low.
   • The value assigned for each impact level is 100 for high, 50 for moderate, and
     10 for low.

    Table 10-2, below, describes the risk levels shown in the above matrix. This risk
scale, with its ratings of high, moderate, and low, represents the degree of risk to
which an information system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given
vulnerability were exploited. It also describes the type of action senior managers
must take for each risk level.

                 Table 10-2. Risk Scale and Necessary Management Action
Risk Level                      Risk Description and Necessary Management Action
             If an observation or finding is evaluated as high risk, there is a strong need for corrective
  High       measures. An existing system may continue to operate, but a corrective action plan must be
             put in place as soon as possible.
             If an observation is rated as moderate risk, corrective actions are needed and a plan must be
Moderate
             developed to incorporate these actions within a reasonable period of time.
             If an observation is described as low risk, the system’s authorizing official must determine
   Low
             whether corrective actions are still required or decide to accept the risk.


10.1.5 Step 5 – Control Recommendations
    The goal of the control recommendations is to reduce the level of risk to the
information system and its data to a level the organization deems acceptable. These
recommendations are essential input for the risk mitigation process, during which the
recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized,
and implemented. This step is designed to help agencies identify and select controls
appropriate to the organization’s operations and mission that could mitigate or
eliminate the risks identified in the preceding steps. The following factors should be
considered in recommending controls and alternative solutions to minimize or
eliminate identified risks:
   • Effectiveness of recommended options (e.g., system compatibility);
   • Legislation and regulation;



                                                                                                            90
CHAPTER 10                                                        Risk Management


   • Organizational policy;
   • Operational impact; and
   • Safety and reliability.
    Agencies should consult NIST SP 800-53 for further guidance on the development
of control recommendations.

10.1.6 Step 6 – Results Documentation
    The risk assessment report is the mechanism used to formally report the results
of all risk assessment activities. The intended function of this report is to describe
and document the risk posture of the system while it is operating in its stated
environment (as described in the system characterization) and to provide
organization managers with sufficient information so that they can make sound, risk-
based decisions, such as resources that must be allocated to the risk mitigation
phase. Lastly, the agency should ensure that the results of the risk assessment are
appropriately reflected in the system’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) and
System Security Plan.
   At a minimum, the risk assessment report should describe the following:
   •   Scope of the assessment based on the system characterization;
   •   Methodology used to conduct the risk assessment;
   •   Individual observations resulting from conducting the risk assessment; and
   •   Estimation of the overall risk posture of the system.




                                                                                    91
CHAPTER 10                                                          Risk Management


10.2 Risk Mitigation
    The second phase of the risk management process is risk mitigation. Because it
is impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate all risk from a system, risk mitigation
strives to prioritize, evaluate, and implement the appropriate risk-reducing controls
recommended from the risk assessment process based on the guidance provided in
NIST SP 800-53.
    System and organizational managers may use several options to reduce the risk
to a system. These options are risk assumption; risk avoidance; risk limitation; risk
planning, research, and acknowledgement; and risk transference.
    Figure 10-4 illustrates a straightforward strategy that can be used to determine
whether risk mitigation actions are necessary. Working from each risk identified and
analyzed in the first process—risk assessment—managers must then decide whether
the risk is acceptable or unacceptable and, subsequently, whether to implement
additional controls or not to mitigate unacceptable risks. The first decision box in the
figure applies to those threats involving intentional attacks. Natural and
unintentional human errors are not considered in this decision-making scheme
because there are no associated costs to consider, and so the strategy progresses to
the next decision box.




                          Figure 10-4. Risk Mitigation Strategy

    Once the decision has been made on which risks are to be addressed in the risk
mitigation process, a seven-step approach is used to guide the selection of security
controls:
   1.   Prioritize actions;
   2.   Evaluate recommended control options;
   3.   Conduct cost-benefit analyses;
   4.   Select controls;
   5.   Assign responsibility;
   6.   Develop a safeguard implementation plan; and
   7.   Implement selected control(s).
    The process of selecting controls to mitigate identified risks to an acceptable level
is based on the security categorization of the system using the methodology
provided in FIPS 199. The security categorization is used in two ways: (1)
determines which minimum baseline security controls are selected from NIST SP
800-53, and (2) aids in estimating the level of risk posed by a threat/vulnerability



                                                                                      92
CHAPTER 10                                                                           Risk Management


pair identified during the risk assessment (see Chapter 5 of this handbook and NIST
SP 800-30 for a discussion on identifying threat/vulnerability pairs). FIPS 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems,
mandates the use of NIST SP 800-53 for selecting minimum baseline security
controls for government systems. System security controls selected are grouped
into one of the three categories of management, operational, or technical controls,
and are either preventive or detective in nature.
    For new systems, once the security controls for the system have been identified
and refined and an initial risk assessment conducted, the selected controls must be
implemented. For legacy systems, the security controls that are selected are
verified. Organizations can leverage controls used among multiple systems by
designating them as common controls where implementation, assessment, and
monitoring is conducted at an organizational level or by areas of specific expertise
(e.g., human resources, physical security, building management). The system
owner must understand who is responsible for implementing these controls and
identify the risk that this extension of trust will generate. For information on
common controls, see NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1.
    Because it is impracticable to eliminate all risk, it is important to note that even
after the controls have been selected and implemented, some degree of residual risk
will remain. The remaining residual risk should be analyzed to ensure that it is at an
acceptable level. For federal agencies, after the appropriate controls have been put
in place for the identified risks, the authorizing official will sign a statement accepting
any residual risk and either authorize the operation of the new information system or
request continued processing of the existing information system. If the residual risk
has not been reduced to an acceptable level, the risk management cycle must be
repeated to identify a way of lowering the residual risk to an acceptable level.

10.3 Evaluation and Assessment
   The third and final phase in the risk management process is evaluation and
assessment. The art of risk management in today’s dynamic and constantly
changing information technology (IT) environments must be ongoing and
continuously evolving. Systems are upgraded and expanded, components are
improved, and architectures are constantly evolving.
    The security control evaluation and assessment, which is conducted during the
Security Certification Phase of a system’s security certification and accreditation,
provides input needed to finalize the risk assessment. 68 The results are used to
provide the Authorizing Official with the essential information needed to make a
credible, risk-based decision on whether to authorize the operation of the
information system. Ideally, the risk assessment activities would be conducted at
the same time the system is being certified and accredited. The reuse of assessment
data will not only save valuable resources, but also provide the most up-to-date risk
information for the authorizing official.
Many of the risk management activities are conducted during a snapshot in time—a
static representation of a dynamic environment. All the changes that occur to
systems during normal, daily operations have the potential to adversely affect the
security of the system in some fashion, and it is the goal of the risk management

     Systems, and Chapter 11, Certification and Accreditation, of this guide for additional guidance on the
     C&A process.



                                                                                                              93
CHAPTER 10                                                                         Risk Management


evaluation and assessment process to ensure that the system continues to operate in
a safe and secure manner. This goal can be partially reached by implementing a
strong configuration management program. 69 In addition, to monitoring the security
of an information system on a continuous basis, agencies must track findings from
the security control assessment to ensure they are addressed appropriately and do
not continue to pose or introduce new risks to the system.
    The process of managing risk permeates the Systems Development Life Cycle
(SDLC), beginning with the early stages of project inception through the retirement
of the system and its data. From inception forward, agencies should consider the
possible threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to the system so that they can better
prepare it to operate in its intended environment, securely and effectively, and
within a select risk threshold, as deemed acceptable by an agency senior official
during the security certification and accreditation process.

Chapter 11
11. Certification, Accreditation, and
    Security Assessments
    Security certification and accreditation are important activities that support a risk
management process and an integral part of an agency's information security
program. The security certification and accreditation process is designed to ensure
that an information system will operate with the appropriate management review,
that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that reaccreditation occurs
periodically.
    Required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix
III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, security certification and
accreditation serves a function similar to quality control. It is the official
management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an
information system and to explicitly accept the risk on behalf of the agency. In this
vein, it makes senior officials who accept risk fully accountable for their decisions,
and in doing so, encourages diligence in the decision-making process.
    The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and OMB Circular A-
130, Appendix III, both require that federal agencies perform IT security risk
assessments and prepare security plans for all systems. Both risk assessments and
security plans are essential components of the security certification and accreditation
process. Whether formal or informal, risk assessments provide much of the data
needed to formulate a security plan that addresses the risks identified for a given
system. Both the risk assessment and the development and maintenance of a
security plan that accurately reflects the security requirements and controls in place
for a particular system must be incorporated into the system development life cycle
(SDLC). 70
    In addition to risk assessments and system security plans, security assessments
have an important role in security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials
have the most complete and accurate information possible on the security status of
their information systems in order to make timely and sound risk-based decisions.
The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation are
developed during a detailed security evaluation of a system, typically referred to as
security certification.
   Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management,
operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in
support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a
security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security
accreditation decision.

     Life Cycle, of this guide for additional information on the SDLC.



                                                                                                    96
Chapter 11                       Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


    By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts the risks
associated with operating the system and the associated implications on agency
operations, agency assets, or agency individuals. Completing a security accreditation
ensures that an information system will be operated with appropriate management
review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that
reaccredidation occurs periodically in accordance with federal or agency policy and
whenever there is a significant change to the system or its operational environment.
    In May, 2004, the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) published National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide
for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems. It
provides specific recommendations on how to certify and accredit information
systems, and it is applicable to all federal information systems other than those
systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 United States Code
(U.S.C.), Section 3542. 11. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private
sector organizations, are encouraged to use the guidelines, as appropriate. The goals
of the guidelines are as follows:
       • Enable more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security
         controls in federal information systems;
       • Promote a better understanding of agency-related mission risks resulting from
         the operation of information systems; and
       • Create more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for authorizing
         officials to facilitate more informed security accreditation decisions.
   NIST SP 800-37 provides augmented, updated security certification and
accreditation information to federal agencies and replaced Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 102, Guidelines for Computer Security Certification and
Accreditation, September 1983, when it was rescinded in February 2005.

11.1 Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments Roles and
     Responsibilities
    While federal agencies have in place widely varied naming
conventions/nomenclatures for IT security or security certification and accreditation
roles, most basic functions in security certification and accreditation process are
essentially the same throughout all agencies. 71 The security certification and
accreditation process described in this Special Publication is flexible, allowing each
agency to accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective
organization.

11.1.1 Chief Information Officer
    The chief information officer (CIO) works closely with authorizing officials and
their designated representatives to ensure that an agency-wide security program is
implemented effectively, including all aspects of the security certification and
accreditation program component. The CIO has the following responsibilities in
relation to security certification and accreditation:
       • Promulgate cost-effective practices such as encouraging maximum reuse and
         sharing of security-related information to include:


71
     See Chapter 2, Governance; Chapter 5, Capital Planning; Chapter 8, Security Planning; and Chapter 14,
     Configuration Management, of this guide for additional guidance on roles and responsibilities.



                                                                                                       97
Chapter 11                    Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


      – Threat and vulnerability assessments;
      – Risk assessments;
      – Results from common security control assessments; and
      – Any other general information that may be of assistance to information
         system owners and their supporting security staffs.
    • In concert with authorizing official, determine appropriate allocation of
      resources for security programs and systems; and
    • In certain instances, operate as the authorizing official for agency-wide general
      support systems (GSS) or as co-authorizing official with other senior officials
      for selected agency systems.

11.1.2 Authorizing Official
    The authorizing official (or designated approving/accrediting authority) is a senior
management official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility
for operating an information system
at an acceptable level of risk to an           Authorizing Official’s Designated Representative
agency. It is possible that a
particular system may require more          The Authorizing Official’s Designated Representative can
                                            be empowered to act on behalf of the authorizing official
than one authorizing official. If so,       in all C&A activities for which the authorizing official is

among the authorizing officials and         the system security accreditation decision, and 2) signing
documented in the system security           the system security accreditation decision letter.
plan. In most cases, it may be
advantageous to agree to elect a lead authorizing official to represent the interests of
the other authorizing officials. The authorizing official has inherent U.S. government
authority and, as such, must be a government employee. The authorizing official
has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
    • Oversee the budget and business operations of the system;
    • Approve system security requirements, system security plans, and
      memorandums of understanding (MOU) and/or memorandums of agreement
      (MOA);
    • Make and issue final or interim decision on granting, conditionally granting, or
      denying authority to operate system; and
    • Appoint, if so chosen, a designated representative to act on the authorizing
      official’s behalf in coordinating and carrying out the necessary activities
      required during the security certification and accreditation of a system.

11.1.3 Senior Agency Information Security Officer
   The SAISO (or supporting staff member) may serve as the authorizing official's
designated representative. The SAISO serves as the CIO’s primary liaison to the
agency’s authorizing officials, information system owners, and Information System
Security Officers (ISSOs).

11.1.4 Information System Owner
    The information system owner is responsible for the overall procurement,
development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an
information system. The information system owner has the following responsibilities
in relation to security certification and accreditation:


                                                                                                   98
Chapter 11               Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


   • Develop and maintain the system security plan;
   • Ensure system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon security
     requirements;
   • Authorize user access to the information system (and with what types of
     privileges or access rights);
   • Ensure system users and support personnel receive the requisite security
     training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior);
   • Inform key agency officials of the need to conduct a security certification and
     accreditation of the information system;
   • Ensure appropriate resources are available for the security certification and
     accreditation effort;
   • Provide necessary system-related documentation to the certification agent;
   • Take appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate system vulnerabilities identified
     in the security certification and accreditation process; and
   • Assemble the security accreditation package and submit it to authorizing official
     or authorizing official’s designated representative for adjudication.

11.1.5 Information Owner
    The information owner has statutory or operational authority for specified
information and is responsible for establishing the controls for its generation,
collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner has the
following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
   • Establish rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information
     (e.g., rules of behavior); and
   • Communicate level of information assurance required for the system with the
     appropriate system owner.

11.1.6 Information System Security Officer
   The ISSO is responsible to the authorizing official, information system owner, or
the SAISO for ensuring that the appropriate operational security posture is
maintained for an information system or program. The ISSO has the following
responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
   • Serve as the principal advisor to the authorizing official, information system
     owner, or SAISO on all matters relating to the security of the information
     system;
   • Perform or oversee performance of day-to-day security operations of the
     system;
   • Develop or assist in development of system security policy;
   • Ensure compliance with system security policy;
   • Coordinate/manage changes to the system with the system owner and the
     information owner, as necessary;
   • Assess security impact of system changes; and
   • Develop and update the system security plan.



                                                                                       99
Chapter 11                Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


11.1.7 Certification Agent
    The certification agent is either an individual, a group, or an organization
responsible for conducting a security certification or a comprehensive assessment of
the effectiveness of security controls in an information system. The impartiality and
independence of the certification agent are important factors in assessing the
credibility of the security assessment results and ensuring that the authorizing
official receives the most objective information possible to make an informed, risk-
based accreditation decision. The certification agent has the following responsibilities
in relation to security certification and accreditation:
   • Assess the system security plan to ensure the plan provides applicable security
     controls prior to initializing the certification process;
   • Performs a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
     technical controls in the information system; and
   • Recommend corrective actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the
     information system.

11.1.8 User Representatives
    Users are responsible for identifying mission/operational requirements and for
complying with the security requirements and security controls described in the
system security plan. User representatives are individuals that represent the
operational interests of the user community and serve as liaisons for that community
throughout the SDLC of the information system. The user representatives assist in
the security certification and accreditation process, when needed, to ensure that
mission requirements are satisfied while meeting the security requirements and
using the security controls defined in the system security plan.

11.2 Delegation of Roles
    At the discretion of senior agency officials, certain security certification and
accreditation roles may be delegated and, if so, appropriately documented. Agency
officials may appoint suitably qualified individuals, including contractors, to perform
the activities associated with any security certification and accreditation role with the
exception of the CIO and authorizing official. The CIO and authorizing official have
inherent U.S. government authority, and those roles should be assigned to
government personnel only. Individuals serving in delegated roles are able to
operate with the authority of agency officials within the limits defined for the specific
security certification and accreditation activities. Agency officials retain ultimate
responsibility, however, for the results of actions performed by individuals serving in
delegated roles.

11.3 The Security Certification and Accreditation Process
   The security certification and accreditation process consists of four distinct
phases, each further divided into well-defined tasks and subtasks. The four phases
are:
   • Initiation Phase;

   • Security Accreditation Phase; and
   • Continuous Monitoring Phase.




                                                                                     100
Chapter 11                      Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


   The Initiation phase consists of three tasks: (1) preparation, (2) notification
and resource identification, and (3) system security plan review, analysis, and
acceptance. This phase will ensure that the authorizing official and the SAISO agree
with the contents of the system security plan before the certification agent begins
assessing the security controls in the information system.
    The Security Certification phase consists of two tasks: (1) security control
assessment, and (2) security certification documentation. An information system
must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, by implementing
the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described in NIST
SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.
System assessments are conducted by examining, reviewing, and testing the
implementation of the appropriate security control baseline contained in NIST SP
800-53. The procedures for assessing and reporting the assessment results are
contained in NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
Information Systems. 72
    The security certification phase determines the extent to which the security
controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
and producing the desired system security posture. This phase also identifies specific
actions taken or planned to correct security control deficiencies and to reduce or
eliminate known system vulnerabilities. At the conclusion of this phase, the
authorizing official should have sufficient data to assess the level of risk the system
poses to the agency, and render a security accreditation decision.
    The Security Accreditation phase consists of two tasks: (1) security
accreditation decision and (2) security accreditation documentation. This phase is
intended to help the accreditation authority determine whether the remaining known
vulnerabilities in the system (after implementing an agreed-upon set of security
controls) pose an acceptable level of risk to the agency. After successfully completing
this phase, the information system owner will be facing one of three scenarios:
      • Formal authorization to operate the information system is granted;
      • An interim authorization to operate the information system under specific terms
        and conditions is granted; or
      • Authorization to operate the information system                      Accreditation Package
        is denied.                                          Typically, the information system owner is responsible for
                                                                        compiling C&A documentation. However, the system
    The Continuous Monitoring phase is discussed                        owner should work closely with the information owner, the
in section 11.6.                                                        ISSO, and the certification authority to ensure that the
                                                                        package meets all agency requirements.

11.4 Security Certification Documentation
    The security certification and accreditation process, in its entirety, culminates in a
risk management decision by an agency official. The security accreditation package
documents the results of the security certification and provides the authorizing
official with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of the information system. The security
accreditation package contains the following documents:
                                                                              Security Plan Contents
    • Approved system security plan,
                                                                 Documents typically attached or referenced in a security
    • Security assessment report, and                            plan include: risk assessment, privacy impact
    • Plan of Action and Milestones.                             assessment, contingency plan, incident response plan,
                                                                             CM plan, security configuration checklists, and any
72                                                                           system interconnection agreement.
     The second draft of NIST SP 800-53A was published in April 2006.



                                                                                                          101
Chapter 11                       Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


    The system security plan provides an overview of the security requirements for
the information system and explains the measures the information system owner has
taken or plans to take to comply with those requirements. 73 While not strictly
required and left to the discretion of the agency, the plan may contain supporting
appendices or as references, other system security documents. Such documents may
include the risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, contingency plan,
configuration management plan, security configuration checklists, and any system
interconnection agreements.
   The security assessment report (SAR) summarizes the results of the activities
undertaken by the certification agent. The security assessment report can also
contain a list of recommended corrective actions and the completed system reporting
form.
    The POA&M describes the measures that have been implemented or planned to
correct any deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to
reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities. Figure 11-1 provides an overview
of the key sections of the security accreditation package.




                       Figure 11-1. Key Security Accreditation Components




11.5 Accreditation Decisions
    The security accreditation package documents the results of the security
certification. To ensure that the agency's business and operational needs are fully
considered, the authorizing official should meet with the system owner prior to
issuing the security accreditation decision. In this meeting, the certification and
accreditation authorities should clearly explain the rationale for their risk-based
decision and, where appropriate, fully explain the terms and conditions of the
authorization.
   The security accreditation decision communicates the accreditation authority’s
decision and provides the information system owner with the:
       • Security accreditation decision – official decision by the authorizing official on
         whether to accredit the system, accredit the system with conditions, or deny
         system accreditation;



73
     See NIST 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, Revision 1, and
     Chapter 8, Security Planning, of this guide for additional guidance on system security planning.



                                                                                                      102
Chapter 11                Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


   • Supporting rationale for the decision – justification for the authorizing official’s
     decision; and
   • Terms and conditions for the authorization – limitations or restrictions placed
     on the operation of the system to which the system owner is bound.
    The contents of security certification and accreditation-related documentation,
especially information dealing with information system vulnerabilities, should be
marked and protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy, and retained
in accordance with the agency’s record retention policy.

11.6 Continuous Monitoring
   The Continuous Monitoring phase is an essential component in any security
program. During this phase, the status of the security controls in the information
system are checked on an ongoing basis. An effective continuous monitoring
program can be used to support the annual FISMA requirement for assessing the
security controls in information systems. At a minimum, an effective monitoring
program requires the following:
   • Configuration management and configuration control processes for the
     information system;
   • Security impact analyses on changes to the information system; and
   • Assessment of selected security controls in the information system and
     reporting of information system security status to appropriate agency officials.
    To determine which security controls to select for review, agencies should first
prioritize testing on POA&M items that become closed. These newly implemented
controls should be validated. Agencies should test against system-related security
control changes that occurred but did not constitute a major change necessitating a
new C&A. Agencies should identify all security controls that are continuously
monitored as annual testing and evaluation activities. Examples of this include (but
are not limited to) ongoing security training, Denial of Service and Malicious Code
protection activities, Intrusion Detection monitoring, Log File reviews, etc. Once this
is completed, agencies should look at the remaining controls that have not been
tested for that year and make a decision on further annual testing based on risk,
importance of control, and date of last test.
   The results of continuous monitoring should be reported to the authorizing official
and senior agency information security officer on a regular basis and any necessary
updates made to the system security plan. A continuous monitoring reporting form is
provided in NIST SP 800-53A.

11.7 Program Assessments
    FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-
wide information security program to provide information security for the information
and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,
including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.
   To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of information security controls, FISMA
requires agency program officials and CIOs to conduct annual reviews of the
agency’s information security program and report the results to OMB. OMB uses this
data to assist in its oversight responsibilities and to prepare an annual report to
Congress on agency compliance with FISMA.




                                                                                      103
Chapter 11               Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


     In addition, FISMA requires each agency to conduct an independent evaluation of
its information security program each year. For agencies with an inspector general
(IG), that evaluation is to be done by the agency IG. For agencies without an IG, the
evaluation is to be done by an external auditor. In either case, the agency annual
report to OMB must include the independent evaluation.
    Each quarter, agencies prepare and submit plan of action and milestone (POA&M)
reports to OMB for all programs and systems where an information system security
weakness has been found. In addition, program officials shall regularly (at the
direction of the CIO) update the agency CIO on their program to enable the CIO to
monitor agency-wide remediation efforts and provide the quarterly update of the
POA&M to OMB.
    To assist agencies in meeting their annual FISMA reporting requirements, the
Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire contained in Annex 11.A
Agency Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire, provides questions
on many of the areas typically required for inclusion in agency reports. The
questionnaire contains agency-wide, program-level questions that are not found in
NIST SP 800-53. The questionnaire can be customized with agency-specific,
program-related questions and can be completed by the CIO, the senior agency
information security officer (SAISO), or an independent assessor who is evaluating
the agency information security program.
    The questionnaire consists of a cover sheet and a series of questions which are
answered for the Agency Information Security Program. The cover sheet requires
descriptive information such as the name of the agency, bureau, or agency-operating
unit, and the name, title, and organization of the individual completing the
questionnaire. The date and time period covered in the report should be listed along
with describing the purpose of the assessment. For example, the annual assessment
of the agency information security program is required by FISMA; an assessment
was performed because of repeated virus infections. The final information listed on
the cover sheet is the number of agency systems in the low, moderate, and high
FIPS 199 impact categories.
    The series of questions are related to the management of an agency-wide
information security program. Each of these questions addresses information
security program elements critical to the success of an agency information security
program. This section is flexible and extensible. The agency may add as many
questions as desired to more fully assess the status and/or effectiveness of the
agency information security program or to address questions or concerns that are
raised by other interested parties.
    Each question should be answered for each level of IT Security maturity. For the
“Policy” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be documented in agency
policy. For the “Procedures” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” the topic should be
documented in detailed procedures. For the “Implemented” maturity level, to answer
“Yes,” the implementation is verified by examining the procedures and program area
documentation, and interviewing key personnel to determine that the procedures are
implemented. For the “Tested” maturity level, to answer “Yes,” documents should
be examined and interviews should be conducted to verify that the policies and
procedures for the question are implemented and operating as intended and provide
the desired level of security. For the “Integrated” maturity level, to answer “Yes,”
the policies, procedures, implementation, and testing are continually monitored and
improvements are made as a normal business process of the agency.




                                                                                 104

       Annex 11.B Minimum Security Controls

Security controls in the security control catalog (NIST SP 800-53, Appendix F) have a well-
defined organization and structure. The security controls are organized into classes and families
for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. There are three general classes
of security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical 75 ). Each family contains
security controls related to the security function of the family. A standardized, two-character
identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. Table 11-1 summarizes the classes
and families in the security control catalog and the associated family identifiers.

Security control class designations (i.e., management, operational, and technical) are defined
below for clarification in preparation of system security plans.
Management controls focus on the management of the information system and the management
of risk for a system. They are techniques and concerns that are normally addressed by
management. Operational controls address security methods focusing on mechanisms primarily
implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). These controls are put in place to
improve the security of a particular system (or group of systems). They often require technical or
specialized expertise and often rely upon management activities as well as technical controls.

75
     Security control families in NIST SP 800-53 are associated with one of three security control classes
     (i.e., management, operational, technical). Families are assigned to their respective classes based on
     the dominant characteristics of the controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be
     logically associated with more than one class. For example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control
     from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational control but also has characteristics that
     are consistent with security management as well.




                                                                                                                   111
Technical controls focus on security controls that the computer system executes. The controls
can provide automated protection for unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of
security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data.

Chapter 12
12. Security Services and Products
    Acquisition
    Information security services and products are essential elements of an
organization’s information security program. Many products and services to support
an agency’s information security program for information systems are widely
available in the marketplace today, and are frequently used by federal agencies.
Security products and services should be selected and used within the organization’s
overall program to manage the design, development, and maintenance of its
information security infrastructure, and to protect its mission-critical information. In
the acquisition of both, agencies should apply risk management principles to aide in
the identification and mitigation of risks associated with the acquisition.
    In the acquisition of information security products, agencies are encouraged to
conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the product-selection process – one that
also includes the costs associated with risk mitigation. This cost-benefit analysis
should include a life cycle cost (LCC) estimate for the status quo and one for each
identified alternative while highlighting the benefits associated with each alternative.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-
36, Guide to Selecting Information Technology (IT) Security Products, first defines
broad security product categories and specifies product types, product
characteristics, and environment considerations within those categories. The guide
then provides a list of pertinent questions that agencies should ask when selecting
products.
     As with the acquisition of products, the acquisition of services bears considerable
risks that federal agencies must identify and mitigate. The importance of
systematically managing the process for acquisition of information security services
cannot be underestimated because of the potential impact associated with those
risks. In selecting this type of services, agencies should employ risk management
processes in the context of information security services life cycle, which provides an
organizational framework for information security decision makers. NIST SP 800-35,
Guide to Information Technology Security Services, provides assistance with the
selection, implementation, and management of information security services by
guiding the reader through the various phases of the information security services
life cycle. Information security decision makers must consider the costs involved, the
underlying security requirements, and the impact of their decisions on the
organizational mission, operations, strategic functions, personnel, and service-
provider arrangements.
    The process of selecting information security products and services involves
numerous people throughout an organization. Each person involved in the process,
whether on an individual or group level, should understand the importance of
security in the organization’s information infrastructure and the security impacts of
their decisions. Depending on its needs, an organization may include all of the
personnel listed below or a combination of particular positions relevant to
information security needs.




                                                                                    113

12.1   Information Security Services Life Cycle
    The security services life cycle provides a framework to help security decision
makers organize and coordinate their security efforts—from initiation to completion.
Figure 12-1 depicts the security services life cycle for obtaining security services at a
high level. Table 12-1 provides a brief summary of each phase.

                  It is more likely that the environment will change such that information security program
                   managers will identify triggers that will initiate a new and replacement information security

                  Select the appropriate exit strategy
                  Implement the selected exit strategy



12.2 Selecting Information Security Services
    Before selecting specific services, organizations should review the current status
of their security programs and the security controls that are either planned or in
place to protect information systems and data. Organizations should use the risk
management process to identify an effective mix of management, operational, and
technical security controls that will mitigate risk to an acceptable level. The number
and type of appropriate security controls and their corresponding information
security services may vary throughout a particular system’s services life cycle. The
relative maturity of an organization’s security architecture is likely to influence the
types of security controls that are appropriate for a particular system. The blend of
security controls is tied to the mission of the organization and the role of the system
within the organization as it supports that mission. A more in-depth look at the
various types of security controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, February 2006.
Table 12-2 lists categories of information security services.




                                                                                                                   115

                       Table 12-2. Information Security Services Categories
      Categories                                            Description
                          Techniques and concerns normally addressed by management in the
Management Services       organization’s computer security program. They focus on managing the computer
                          security program and the risk within the organization.
                          Services focused on controls implemented and executed by people (as opposed to
Operational Services      systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and rely on
                          management activities and technical controls.
                          Technical services focused on security controls a computer system executes.
Technical Services        These services are dependent on the proper function of the system for
                          effectiveness.


     Selecting the most appropriate services, service mix, and service level is a
 complex decision, as is deciding who should provide the needed services. A broad
 range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its
 internal employees and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to
 fully export the service to an external service provider. This external service
 provider could be any organization, including an external group from a subsidiary
 organization, a business unit, or a commercial service provider.

 12.2.1 Selecting Information Security Services Management Tools
     Because of the potential harm caused by inadequate security, information
 security program managers and decision makers must employ effective management
 tools to increase the likelihood of success of acquired security services. Two
 important tools are metrics and service agreements, both of which can be used to
 make security service providers accountable for the results derived from the services
 they provide to the organization.
     • Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision making and
       accountability through practical, relevant data collection, data analysis, and
       performance data reporting.
     • A service agreement is an agreement between the service provider and the
       organization requesting the service that specifies all services the service
       provider is to provide, to what extent, the duration of services, etc.

 12.2.2 Information Security Services Issues
     Implementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each
 security service carries its own costs and associated risks, as does each service
 arrangement. Making a decision based on one single issue can have major
 implications for the organization in other areas. For example, if it becomes clear that
 an external organization can provide the service more cost-effectively than the
 current internal service provider, security decision makers will have to consider the
 implications to the organization’s current personnel. The decision makers will have
 to balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with
 potential loss of employee morale, attrition, and intellectual capital. Table 12-3
 provides a list of general factors and issues associated with acquiring security
 services, grouped into six categories. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; it
 provides the most common, but not all, related factors and issues.




                                                                                                    116

    Categories                                                Issues
                      For all the importance of security in general and information security in particular, it
                      must support the mission or business function. When thinking about the implications
Strategic/Mission     of any decision, ultimately, decision makers must ask themselves what is best for the
                      organization from a strategic point of view and what best helps the organization meet
                      its mission.
                      Though funding is often at the heart of any business decision, cost is only one of

                      IT services, including management services with technical implications. Throughout
Technical/
                      the life cycle, information security program managers must consider whether their
Architectural
                      decisions have a technical and architectural effect on the organization.
                      Issues such as damage to an organization’s image and reputation, change in focus
                      on core competencies, and resiliency of the organization, relate to the intangible
                      elements of an organization. In many cases, long-accepted internal controls and
Organizational
                      business practices that have developed over time due to natural business unit
                      divisions or regulatory requirements may have to be reconsidered when an
                      information security service provider is engaged.
                      Issues related to the organization’s contractors and employees. Managers must
                      remain aware of the impact of their decisions on their employees. Depending on the
Personnel             service arrangement implemented, major ramifications could exist for current
                      employees; understanding these potential implications and dealing with them early
                      will ensure the employees remain an important resource for the organization.
                      Effective security starts with strong policy, and implications to policies and process
Policy/Process
                      must be considered to ensure appropriate transitions and implementations.


12.2.3 General Considerations for Information Security Services
    In identifying the service provider that best meets an organization’s needs,
decision makers will need to have many questions answered. Specifically, depending
on the nature of the data the service provider accesses and processes on behalf of
the agency, the service provider may be subject to legislative and regulatory
requirements, including Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and
NIST standards and guidance, such as SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls
for Federal Information Systems, SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, and others. Questions pertaining to
these requirements should become part of the organization’s standard process for
researching and evaluating information security services and service providers. Table
12-4 is a representative sample of such questions, which includes general questions
grouped into the six issue categories.
   These questions are intended as a guide, and each organization will need to
decide which questions are relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an
exhaustive list, and organizations should develop additional questions. Lastly, the
question may best be answered by the organization, not the service provider.




                                                                                                         117

12.3 Selecting Information Security Products
    As with security services, before selecting specific products, organizations should
review the current status of their security programs and the security controls that
are either planned or in place to protect their information and information systems.

information security products.

       Type
   Organizational         Identify the user community
                          Define the relationship between the security product and the organization’s mission
                          Identify data sensitivity
                          Identify an organization’s security requirements
                          Review security plan
                          Review policies and procedures
                          Identify operational issues such as daily operation, maintenance, and training
   Product                Determine total LCC (including acquisition and support)
                          Assess ease of use
                          Assess scalability
                          Identify interoperability requirements
                          Identify test requirements
                          Review known vulnerabilities
                          Test and implement relevant patches
                          Review product specifications against existing and planned organizational programs,
                           policies, procedures, and standards
                          Identify security critical dependencies with other products
                          Investigate the new product’s interactions with the existing infrastructure
   Vendor                 Determine whether the selection of a particular product will limit future security choices
                          Assess vendor experience and viability
                          Explore vendor history in responding to security flaws in its products


    To facilitate identification and review of these considerations, security program
managers may use a set of questions when considering security products for their
programs. Table 12-6 lists questions that are product-independent and should be
posed during the product selection phase. These questions are organized into three
categories: those that apply to the organization, those that apply to the product or
its operation, and those that apply to the vendor. It should be noted, however, that
these questions are neither exhaustive nor relevant in all circumstances.
Organizations should use these questions as a guide, and edit and supplement the
questions as required by their unique circumstances in addition to ensuring that their
decisions are consistent with their architecture and a well-established business case.

                                                                         security architecture.

Vendor           Does the vendor have an associated security guide
                  for the product?
Vendor           Does the vendor use or make reference to NIST,
                  consortia, or other consensus-based checklists,
                  security configurations/settings, or benchmarks?

    Some examples of product types include access control, intrusion detection and
other information security-related products. Before deciding to purchase any type of
security product, decision makers should consider product capabilities, compatibility
with other products, and environmental considerations, among others.

12.4 Security Checklists for IT Products
    Vulnerabilities in IT products surface nearly every day, and many ready-to-use
exploits are widely available on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended
for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security controls are usually not enabled
by default, so many IT products are immediately vulnerable out of the box. Security
program managers should review the NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration
Checklists Program for IT Products, May 2005, which helps to facilitate the
development and dissemination of security checklists so that organizations and
individual users can better secure their IT products. A security configuration
checklist (sometimes called a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is, in its
simplest form, a series of instructions for configuring a product to a particular
operating environment.

12.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest
    An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an
agreement has a past, present, or future interest related to the work performed (or
to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to provide technically sound,
objective service or which may result in an unfair competitive advantage. Agencies
should do their best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. However, if
an organization determines that an OCI exists but cannot be avoided and the
organization wishes to proceed nonetheless, the head of the organization must
formally waive the OCI.
   Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating the effect of the OCI to an
acceptable level, or waiving the OCI are important steps for consideration when


                                                                                                           122
CHAPTER 12                                          Security Services and Products Acquisition


managing the information security service life cycle. However, each of these is a
complex matter involving legal and regulatory issues and, as such, should not be
considered without the counsel of an organization’s legal department.

Chapter 13
13. Incident Response
    Attacks on information systems and networks have become more numerous,
sophisticated, and severe in recent years. While preventing such attacks would be
the ideal course of action for organizations, not all information system security
incidents can be prevented. Every organization that depends on information systems
and networks to carry out its mission should identify and assess the risks to its
systems and its information and reduce those risks to an acceptable level. 78 An
important component of this risk management process is the trending analysis of
past computer security incidents and identifying effective ways to deal with them. A
well-defined incident response capability helps the organization detect incidents
rapidly, minimize loss and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore information
technology (IT) operations rapidly.
    The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) specifically directs
federal agencies to develop and implement procedures for detecting, reporting, and
responding to security incidents. In addition, OMB 79 directs federal agencies to
identify in their FISMA report any incidents (physical or electronic) involving the loss
of or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) and report them
according to the policies outlined in OMB Memorandum. 80 Federal civilian agencies
are responsible for reporting all computer security incidents to the United States
Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) in the Department of Homeland
Security and for documenting the corrective actions taken and their impact.
Specifically, agencies are responsible for reporting all incidents involving PII to the
(US-CERT) within one hour of discovering the incident. Further, policy guidance
issued by the OMB in Circular No. A-130, Appendix III, requires that agencies have a
capability to provide help to users after a system security incident occurs, and to
share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats.

response process. The major phases of the incident response process—preparation,
detection and analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and post-incident activity,
are described in detail throughout the rest of this chapter. Figure 13-1 illustrates the
incident response life cycle.

13.1 Preparation
    Incident preparation involves not only establishing an incident response capability
so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents but also preventing incidents
by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are afforded sufficient security.
Incident prevention is now considered a fundamental component of incident response
programs, also known as incident management programs, although the incident
response team is not typically responsible for it. The incident response team’s
expertise should be used to establish recommendations for securing systems and
preventing incidents, as much as possible. This section provides an overview of
actions needed to prevent and handle incidents, including incident data collection
preparation.

13.1.1 Preparing for Incident Response
     Organizing an effective incident response capability involves the participation of
many people within the organization. Making the right planning and implementation
decisions is key to establishing a successful incident response program. One of the
first planning tasks should be to develop an organization-specific definition of the
term “incident” so that the scope of the term is clear. Additional tasks that should
be performed during the preparation phase include the following:
   • Create an Incident Response Policy. The policy should define what events
     are considered incidents, establish the organizational structure for incident
     response, define roles and responsibilities, and list the organization’s incident
     reporting requirements.
   • Develop Incident Response and Reporting Procedures. Based on the
     incident response policy, standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a
     delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms
     used by the incident response team. SOPs should be comprehensive and
     detailed to ensure that the organization’s priorities are properly reflected in
     response operations. In addition, following standardized response procedures
     is also an effective way to minimize errors, particularly those that might be
     caused by incident handling pace and stress. Prior to implementation, the
     organization should test incident response SOPs in order to validate their
     accuracy and usefulness. Once validated, the SOPs must be widely
     disseminated throughout the organization. Incidents can occur in countless and
     unpredictable ways; therefore, it is impractical to develop comprehensive
     procedures with step-by-step instructions for handling every incident. The best
     that the organization can do is prepare to handle any type of incident, and
     more specifically, to handle common types of incidents.
   • Establish Guidelines for Communicating with External Parties. During
     the incident response process, the organization may need to communicate with
     outside parties, including other incident response teams, law enforcement, the
     media, vendors, and external victims. Because such communications often
     need to occur quickly, organizations should have predetermined communication
     guidelines so that only the appropriate information is shared with the right
     parties. If sensitive information is inappropriately released, it can lead to



                                                                                    125
CHAPTER 13                                                       Incident Response


     greater disruption and financial loss than the incident itself. Creating and
     maintaining a list of internal and external points of contact (POC), along with
     backups for each contact, should assist in making communications among
     parties easier and faster.
   • Define Incident Response Team Services. Although the main focus of an
     incident response team is performing incident response, most teams offer
     additional services. Examples of the types of services an incident response
     team can provide to the organization include security advisory distribution,
     vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, and education and awareness.
   • Select a Team Structure and Staffing Model. The organization should
     select the team structure and staffing model best suited to its needs. When
     contemplating the best team structure and staffing model, an organization
     should considers several factors, such as size of the organization, the
     geographic diversity of major computing resources, the need for 24/7
     availability, cost, and staff expertise.
   • Staff and Train the Incident Response Team. Members of the incident
     response team should have excellent technical and problem-solving skills
     because they are critical to the team’s success. Excellent teamwork,
     organizational, communication, and speaking skills are important as well. Most
     incident response teams have a team manager and a deputy team manager
     who assumes authority in the absence of the team manager. In addition, some
     teams also have a technical lead who assumes oversight of and final
     responsibility for the quality of the technical work performed by the entire
     incident response team. Also, larger teams often assign an incident lead as the
     primary POC for handling a specific incident.
    Organizations typically find it challenging to maintain situational awareness for
handling large-scale incidents because of their complexity. Many people within the
organization may play a role in the incident response, and the organization may need
to communicate rapidly and efficiently with various external groups. Collecting,
organizing, and analyzing all the pieces of information so that the right decisions can
be made and executed are not easy tasks. The key to maintaining situational
awareness is to prepare thoroughly to handle large-scale incidents. Two specific
actions that support this matter are as follows:
   • Establish and Maintain Accurate Notification Mechanisms. Organizations
     should establish, document, maintain, and exercise on-hour and off-hour
     contact and notification mechanisms for various individuals and groups within
     the organization (e.g., chief information officer [CIO], head of information
     security, IT support, business continuity planning) and outside the organization
     (e.g., incident response organizations, counterparts at other organizations).
   • Develop Written Guidelines for Prioritizing Incidents. Incident response
     teams should handle each incident with the appropriate priority, based on the
     criticality of the affected resources and the current and potential technical
     effect of the incident. For example, data destruction on a user workstation
     might result in a minor loss of productivity, whereas root compromise of a
     public Web server might result in a major loss of revenue, productivity, access
     to services, and reputation, as well as the release of confidential data (e.g.,
     credit card numbers, social security numbers). Because incident responders
     normally work under stressful conditions ripe for human error, it is important to
     clearly define and articulate the incident handling priority process. The incident



                                                                                   126
CHAPTER 13                                                                         Incident Response


         handling priority process should include a description of how the incident
         response team should react under various circumstances, as well as a service-
         level agreement (SLA) that documents appropriate actions and maximum
         response times. This prioritization should facilitate faster and more consistent
         decision making.

13.1.2 Preparing to Collect Incident Data
    Organizations should be prepared to collect a set of objective and subjective data
for each incident. Over time, the incident data collected by the organization can be
used for many ends. For example, data on the total number of hours the incident
response team has dedicated to incident response activities and its cost over a
particular period of time, may be used to justify additional funding of the incident
response team. A study of incident characteristics may reveal systemic security
weaknesses and threats, changes in incident trends, or other data that can be used
in support of the risk assessment process. Another good use of the data is
measuring the success of the incident response team. If incident data is collected
and stored properly, it should provide several measures of the success (or at least
the activities) of the incident response team. Furthermore, organizations that are
required to report incident information will need to collect the necessary data to
meet their requirements (e.g., FISMA reporting of annual incident statistics). 81
    In the process of preparing to collect incident data, organizations should focus on
collecting data that is actionable, rather than collecting data simply because it is
available. Absolute numbers are not informative—understanding how they represent
threats to and vulnerabilities of the business processes of the organization is what
matters. Organizations should decide what incident data to collect based on
reporting requirements and on the expected return on investment from the data
(e.g., identifying a new threat and mitigating the related vulnerabilities before they
can be exploited).

13.1.3 Preventing Incidents
    Preventing problems is normally less costly and more effective than reacting to
them after they occur. Thus, incident prevention is an important complement to an
incident response capability. If security controls are insufficient, high volumes of
incidents may occur, overwhelming the resources and capacity for response, which
would result in delayed or incomplete recovery, possibly more extensive damage,
and longer periods of service unavailability. Incident handling can be performed
more effectively if organizations complement their incident response capability with
adequate resources to actively maintain the security of networks, systems, and
applications. This process is intended to reduce the frequency of incidents, thereby
allowing the incident response team to focus on handling serious incidents.
Examples of practices that help to prevent incidents are as follows:
       • Having a patch management program to assist system administrators in
         identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying patches that eliminate known
         vulnerabilities in systems and applications;
       • Hardening all hosts appropriately to eliminate vulnerabilities and configuration
         weaknesses;
       • Configuring the network perimeter to deny all activity that is not expressly
         permitted;


81
     See Chapter 7, Performance Measures, for additional guidance on collecting and reporting incident data.



                                                                                                        127
CHAPTER 13                                                        Incident Response


   • Deploying software throughout the organization to detect and stop malicious
     code; and
   • Making users aware of policies and procedures on the appropriate use of
     networks, systems, and applications.

13.2 Detection and Analysis
    Detection and analysis are, for many organizations, the most challenging aspects
of the incident response process, in other words, accurately detecting and assessing
possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the
type, extent, and magnitude of the problem. Incidents can be detected through
many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity. Automated detection
capabilities include network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems
(IDSs), antivirus software, and log analyzers. Incidents may also be detected
through manual means, such as user reports. Some incidents have overt signs that
can be easily detected, whereas others are virtually undetectable without
automation.
    In a typical organization, the thousands or millions of possible signs of incidents
that occur any given day are recorded mainly by computer security software.
Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data and select events of
interest for human review. Event correlation software and centralized logging can be
of great value in automating the analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the
process depends on the quality of the data that goes into it. Organizations should
establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate information is
collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly.
Proper and efficient reviews of incident-related data require people with extensive,
specialized technical knowledge and experience.
     When a potential incident is identified, the incident response team should work
quickly to analyze and validate it, documenting each step taken. The team should
rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, attack methods,
and targeted vulnerabilities. This analysis should provide enough information for the
team to prioritize subsequent activities, including the containment of the incident.
When in doubt, incident handlers should assume the worst until additional analyses
indicate otherwise. In addition to prioritization guidelines, organizations should also
establish an escalation process for those instances when the incident response team
fails to respond to an incident within the designated time.
    The incident response team should maintain records about the status of
incidents, along with other pertinent information. Using an application or database
for this purpose is necessary to ensure that incidents are handled and resolved in a
timely manner. The incident response team should safeguard this data and other
data related to incidents because it often contains sensitive information concerning
recent security breaches, exploited vulnerabilities, and users that may have
performed inappropriate actions.

13.3 Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
    It is important to contain an incident before it spreads to avoid overwhelming
resources and increasing damage caused by the incident. Most incidents require
containment, so it is important to consider it early in the course of handling each
incident. An essential part of containment is decision making, such as shutting down
a system, disconnecting it from the network, or disabling certain system functions.
Such decisions are much easier to make if strategies and procedures for containing



                                                                                   128
CHAPTER 13                                                         Incident Response


the incident have been predetermined. Organizations should define acceptable risks
in dealing with incidents and develop strategies accordingly.
    Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the
overall strategy for containing an e-mail-borne virus infection is quite different from
that of a network-based distributed denial of service attack. Organizations should
create separate containment strategies for each major type of incident. The criteria
for choosing the appropriate strategy should be documented clearly to facilitate quick
and effective decision making. Examples of criteria include potential damage to and
theft of resources, the need to preserve evidence, the effectiveness of the strategy,
the time and resources needed to implement the strategy, and the duration of the
solution.
   After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate
components of the incident, such as deleting malicious code and disabling breached
user accounts. For some incidents, eradication is either unnecessary or is performed
during recovery. In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation
and (if applicable) harden systems to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may
involve such actions as:
    • Restoring systems from clean backups;
    • Rebuilding systems from scratch;
    • Replacing compromised files with clean versions;
    • Installing patches;
    • Changing passwords; and
    • Tightening network perimeter security (e.g., firewall rule sets).
    It is also often desirable to employ higher levels of system logging or network
monitoring as part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully
attacked, it is often attacked again, or other resources within the organization are
attacked in a similar manner

13.4 Post-Incident Activity
    After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a lessons-
learned meeting to review the effectiveness of the incident handling process and
identify necessary improvements to existing security controls and practices.
Lessons-learned meetings should also be held periodically for lesser incidents. The
information accumulated from all lessons-learned meetings, as well as the data
collected while handling each incident, should be used to identify systemic security
weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures. Follow-up reports generated
for each resolved incident can be important for evidentiary purposes, used as a
reference in handling future incidents, and used in training new incident response
team members. An incident database, with detailed information on each incident
that occurs, can be another valuable source of information for incident handlers.

Chapter 14
14. Configuration Management
    The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to manage the effects of
changes or differences in configurations on an information system or network. CM
assists in streamlining change management processes and prevents changes that
could detrimentally affect the security posture of a system before they happen. In
its entirety, the CM process reduces the risk that any changes made to a system
(insertions/installations, deletions/uninstalling, and modifications) result in a
compromise to system or data confidentiality, integrity, or availability in that it
provides a repeatable mechanism for effecting system modifications in a controlled
environment. In accordance with the CM process, system changes must be tested
prior to implementation to observe the effects of the change, thereby minimizing the
risk of adverse results.
    Each organization must take into account the associated costs and expenses, the
required planning and scheduling, and the necessary training associated with a
thorough and effective CM process. However, since each general CM approach is
universal, agencies can structure and implement a repeatable CM process to save
organizational resources on future projects. Additionally, CM helps to eliminate the
risk of confusion, problems, and unnecessary spending. The additional resources
required to correct a problem that could have been prevented through sound CM
practices, is likely to far exceed the amount of resources required to develop and
implement an effective enterprise CM process.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle,
states “Configuration management and control procedures are critical to establishing
an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components for the
information system and subsequently to controlling and maintaining an accurate
inventory of any changes to the system. Changes to the hardware, software, or
firmware of a system can have a significant impact on the security of the
system…changes should be documented, and their potential impact on security
should be assessed regularly.” NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems, defines seven CM controls that
organizations are required to implement based on an information system’s security
categorization. The required CM controls are defined in Table 14-1. 82

                                functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by
                                default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations
                                (e.g., key missions, functions). The functions and services provided by
                                information systems should be carefully reviewed to determine which
                                functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., voice over
                                internet protocol, instant messaging, file transfer protocol, hyper text transfer
                                protocol, file sharing).


14.1 Configuration Management in the System Development Life Cycle
    Although CM is not traditionally regarded as a security function, it must be
addressed in the system development life cycle (SDLC) 83 because of its serious
security implications. CM is just one component of an information system’s security
posture. It falls under the operational controls of an information system and is
interrelated with numerous other security disciplines such as project management,
risk management, security certification and accreditation, 84 and security awareness
training. 85
    CM should be addressed throughout the entire life cycle of any given project or
task. As mentioned earlier, it is nearly impossible to carry out a systems
development or management project with success in the absence of a sound and
effective CM process. In the SDLC, the planning of the CM process falls in Phases 2
and 3; the primary implementation of the CM process is performed during Phase 4,
the Operations/ Maintenance phase. SDLC and its associated key tasks are depicted
in Figure 14-1.

   security awareness and training.

CHAPTER 14                                                           Configuration Management




                             Figure 14-1. System Development Life Cycle


    During Phase 2, Acquisition/Development, the risk management process begins
with the initial risk assessment. NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems, defines risk management as “the process that
allows information technology (IT) managers to balance the operational and
economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by
protecting the information systems and data that support their organizations’
missions.” 86 Risk management encompasses the process of identifying, analyzing,
and responding to risk. This process includes identifying existing vulnerabilities in a
system or in its respective components. Since risk is oftentimes an uncertainty on
whether or not a given event will occur, an executable plan must be in place if a
potential risk is exploited. Risk identification involves determining the possible effect
on an information system due to a risk. During this phase, initial baselines of security
controls are being selected based on assessing the risk level of a network. After the
security controls are established, the CM process can begin. The documented CM

86
     See Chapter 10, Risk Management, of this guide for additional guidance on risk management.



                                                                                                  133
CHAPTER 14                                                               Configuration Management


process should contain procedures and techniques to change a system without
detrimentally impacting it, change any interconnected systems, or change the
network while accounting for the established security level of the network.
    Through Phase 3, Implementation/Assessment, security controls that are
selected in Phase 2 are being tested. Also, the security certification and accreditation
process takes place. NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, defines security accreditation as “the
official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation
of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
security controls.” Within the security certification and accreditation process are four
phases (Initiation, Security Certification, Security Accreditation, and Continuous
Monitoring). The fourth phase, Continuous Monitoring, primarily deals with CM. “With
regard to configuration management and control, it is important to document the
proposed or actual changes to the information system and to subsequently
determine the impact of those proposed or actual changes on the security of the
system. …. Documenting information system changes and assessing the potential
impact those changes may have on the security of the system is an essential aspect
of continuous monitoring and maintaining the security accreditation.” 87
   Lastly, in Phase 4, Operations/Maintenance, CM change control and auditing
steps take place. If there was a significant change addressed in the CM process,
then the system must be recertified and reaccredited. Constant monitoring of the
system is performed to identify possible risks to the system so these can be
addressed through the risk management, security certification and accreditation, and
CM processes.

14.2 Configuration Management Roles and Responsibilities
    There are many roles associated with implementing an effective CM process.
Note that an individual is not limited to a single role (e.g., an individual can be both
the system owner and the CM manager). An organization must ensure that
management is aware of proposed changes and verify that a thorough review and
approval process is in place. Also, separation of duties must be addressed to ensure
that changes are being implemented only after being tested and approved. An
example of the roles and responsibilities for a sample CM process are listed below: 88
       • Chief information officer (CIO). The CIO is responsible for setting forth
         policies concerning CM and implementing CM at the highest level for the
         organization.
       • System owner. The system owner serves as the authority for all matters of
         CM for the system. The system owner is responsible for developing functional
         requirements and verifying that the requirements are implemented
         appropriately.
       • Information systems security officer (ISSO). The ISSO is primarily
         responsible for addressing security concerns related to the CM program and for
         providing expertise and decision support to the Configuration Control Review
         Board (CCRB).

     See Chapter 2, Governance, Chapter 5, Capital Planning, Chapter 8, Security Planning, Chapter 11,
     Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments of this guide for additional guidance on roles and
     responsibilities.



                                                                                                          134
CHAPTER 14                                              Configuration Management


   • CCRB. CM responsibilities of the CCRB include:
     – Discussing and resolving change requests that require additional funding or
       resources to implement;
     – Ensuring that change requests do not adversely affect any systems or
       services related to the system or associated systems, subsystems, and
       facilities; and
     – Evaluating CM metric information on funding and other CM-related issues.
   • CM manager. The CM manager is responsible for day-to-day activities,
     including:
     – Documenting and implementing the CM plan;
     – Establishing system baselines and evaluating controls;
     – Ensuring that proposed changes do not adversely affect agency systems or
       data;
     – Managing change requests and coordinating implementation of changes;
     – Conducting impact analysis of changes;
     – Approving, denying, or deferring changes;
     – Notifying users of system changes;
     – Ensuring existence of a process for storing, retrieving, and distributing CM
       materials; and
     – Ensuring that an audit trail of changes is documented and maintained.
   • System users. System users are responsible for reporting any weaknesses or
     new requirements that are identified in current versions of the software.
   • Developers. The developers are responsible for coordinating and working with
     the CM manager to identify, resolve, and implement controls and other CM
     issues.

14.3 Configuration Management Process
   The CM process identifies the steps required to ensure that all changes are
properly requested, evaluated, and authorized. The CM process also provides a
detailed, step-by-step procedure for identifying, processing, tracking, and
documenting changes. An example CM process is depicted in Figure 14-2.




                              Figure 14-2. CM Process

Step 1: Identify Change
   The first step of the CM process begins with a person or process associated with
the information system identifying a need for a change. The change can be initiated
by numerous individuals, such as users or system owners, or they may be identified
by audit findings or other reviews. A change may consist of updating the fields or
records of a database to upgrading the operating system with the latest security
patches. Once the need for a change has been identified, a change request should
be submitted to the appropriate decision-making body.




                                                                                 135
CHAPTER 14                                              Configuration Management


Step 2: Evaluate Change Request
   After initiating a change request, the effects that the change may have on the
system or other interrelated systems must be evaluated. An impact analysis of the
change should be conducted using the following as a guideline:
   • Whether the change is viable and improves the performance or the security of
     the system;
   • Whether the change is technically correct, necessary, and feasible within the
     system constraints;
   • Whether system security will be affected by the change;
   • Whether associated costs for implementing the change were considered; and
   • Whether security components are affected by the change.

Step 3: Implementation Decision
   Once the change has been evaluated and tested, one of the following actions
should be taken:
   • Approve. Implementation is authorized and may occur at any time after the
     appropriate authorization signature has been documented.
   • Deny. Immediate denial of the request regardless of circumstances and
     information provided.
   • Defer. Immediate decision is postponed until further notice. In this situation,
     additional testing or analysis may be needed before a final decision can be
     made.

Step 4: Implement Approved Change Request
   Once the decision to implement the change has been made, it should be moved
from the test environment into production. If required, the personnel updating the
production environment should be separate from those individuals that developed
the change to provide a greater assurance that unapproved changes do not get
implemented into production.

Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
    The CM process calls for continuous system monitoring to ensure that it is
operating as intended and that implemented changes do not adversely impact either
the performance or security posture of the system. Agencies can achieve the goals
of continuous system monitoring by performing configuration verification tests to
ensure that the selected configuration for a given system has not been altered
outside of the established CM process. In addition to configuration verification tests,
agencies can also perform system audits. Both configuration verification tests and
system audits entail an examination of characteristics of the system and supporting
documentation to verify that the configuration meets user needs and ensure that the
current configuration is the approved system configuration baseline.
    As part of the overall CM process, agencies should also perform patch
management activities during this step. Patch management assists in the process of
lowering the potential risk to a network by “patching” or repairing known
vulnerabilities in any of the network or system environments. Increasingly, vendors
are proactive in developing and releasing to the public fixes (or antidotes) to known
vulnerabilities, and agencies must remain vigilant to ensure that they capture all
relevant fixes as they are released, test their implementation for adverse effects, and



                                                                                   136
CHAPTER 14                                              Configuration Management


implement them if deemed appropriate after testing is concluded. Patching is
associated with Phase 4 in the life cycle as well as with Phases 2 and 3. In Phase 2,
patch management relates to risk management to prevent any vulnerability from
being exploited and compromised. Phase 3 contains the testing to ensure that any
change (including the patching) does not negatively impact the system.

Q. Why is a thorough awareness and training program vital to a security
   program?
A. The workforce is the largest component of the information security solution. It
   comprises the resources that:
   • Develop policy and procedures;
   • Design and develop applications and systems;
   • Implement and monitor security controls;
   • Ensure regulatory compliance;
   • Manage mission and business objectives; and
   • Use the information.
   In terms of the total security solution, the importance of the workforce in
   achieving information security goals and the importance of training as a
   countermeasure cannot be overstated. Establishing and maintaining a robust and
   relevant information security awareness and training program, as part of the
   overall information security program, is the primary conduit for providing the
   workforce with the information and tools needed to protect an agency’s vital
   information resources. Agencies that continually train their workforce in
   organizational security policy and role-based security responsibilities will have a
   higher rate of success in protecting information.
Q. What is security awareness?
A. “Awareness” constitutes the point-of-entry for all employees in pursuing IT
   security knowledge. Awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an
   issue or a set of issues. Awareness is not training.
   Security awareness programs provide a blended solution of activities that
   promote security, establish accountability, and inform the workforce of security


                                                                                     B-1
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   news. Awareness programs continually push the security message to users in a
   variety of formats and provide security information to users.

Q. What is security training?
A. Security training strives to produce relevant and needed security knowledge and
   skills within the workforce. Training supports competency development and helps
   personnel understand and learn how to perform their security role. Security
   training provides general security courses that are appropriate and applicable to
   the entire workforce and offers role-based training that is tailored to the specific
   needs of each security role.

Q. How can an awareness and training program be established?
A. A viable awareness and training program takes time and, if starting from scratch,
   a phased approach will be best. An awareness and training program can be
   established by following a five-phase process, designed to populate an awareness
   and training program:
       1.   Analysis;
       2.   Design;
       3.   Development;
       4.   Implementation; and
       5.   Evaluation.
   Specific details can be found in NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information
   Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, and NIST SP 800-16,
   Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role-and
   Performance-Based Model.

Q. How can an organization enhance security awareness?
A. An organization can enhance security awareness by establishing a continual
   program that uses a variety of methods, including:
   • Tools to promote the security cause, including events, such as a security
     awareness day promotional materials, and rules of behavior;
   • Communication of security-related material with users, managers, executives,
     system owners, and others through activities, such as assessment (as is/to be
     models), strategic plan, and program implementation;
   • Outreach to leverage internal and external awareness “best practices,” such as
     Web portals, security e-newsletters, and FAQs; and
   • Metrics to measure the effectiveness of the awareness program.

Q. When should an awareness and training program be changed?
A. Awareness and training programs should be continually changing to meet the
   unique needs of your environment, culture, business, and mission. Programs
   should continue to evolve as new technology and associated security issues
   emerge. Training needs will shift as new skills and capabilities become necessary
   to respond to new policy and the resultant architectural and technological
   changes. A change in the organizational mission and/or objectives will influence
   ideas on how best to design training solutions and content. Emerging issues, such
   as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of professional
   development activities that will be necessary to keep users informed/educated
   about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. Finally, as security
   policies evolve, awareness and training material should reflect these changes.



                                                                                    B-2
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


Q. What is role-based training?
A. Individuals need security training based on their particular job functions. Over
   time, individuals acquire different roles relative to the use of IT within an
   organization or as they make a career move to a different organization.
   Sometimes they will be users of applications, in other instances they may be
   involved in developing a new system, and in some situations, they may serve on
   a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for IT systems. An
   individual’s security knowledge and skills, and therefore training needs, change
   as their role changes.
   To address this reality, knowledge and skill needs have been categorized by job
   functions into six role-based specialties, which represent categories of generic
   organizational roles: Manage, Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and
   Operate, and Review and Evaluate. Actual positions within your agency are then
   assigned to a role to determine the actual training requirements for that position.
   For example, personnel in positions with duties and tasks for contracting officer,
   contracting officer’s technical representative, and source selection board member
   would be aligned with the “acquire” role. The authorizing official, information
   security officer, and inspector general auditor are aligned with the “review and
   evaluate” role, as they deal primarily with compliance activities.

Q. How can the support for an awareness and training program be gauged?
A. The support for an awareness and training program can be shown through many
   indicators. A few examples are:
   • Key stakeholder demonstrates commitment and support.
   • Sufficient funding is budgeted and available to implement the agreed-upon
     awareness and training strategy.
   • Infrastructure to support broad distribution (e.g., Web, e-mail, learning
     management systems) and posting of security awareness and training materials
     is funded and implemented.
   • Executive/senior-level officials deliver messages to staff about security (e.g.,
     staff meetings, broadcasts to all users by agency head), champion the
     program, and demonstrate support for training by committing financial
     resources to the program.
   • Executives and managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid
     security controls that are consistently adhered to by the rank and file.
   • Level of attendance at voluntary security forums/briefings/training is
     consistently high.

Q. How can the effectiveness of an awareness and training program be
   measured?
A. The effectiveness of an awareness and training program can be shown through
   many indicators. A few examples are:
   • Rampant Internet virus attacks no longer plague an organization.
   • Users can identify “spam” e-mail traffic and reduce it.
   • FISMA scores improve.




                                                                                    B-3
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   • Scores on pre-awareness assessments indicate retention of security knowledge
     from prior year.
   • Personnel are more responsive/proficient in performing their security duties.
   • Personnel at all levels demonstrate a minimum level of security literacy.
   • Personnel are less susceptible to social engineering.
   • Users are implementing stronger passwords.

Q. What is the difference between “certificates” that are awarded by
   vendors, third parties, or universities?
A. There are distinct differences among training “certifications” that are offered by a
   variety of organizations. Primarily, one will encounter certificates of completion,
   certifications awarded by an industry and/or vendors, and graduate-level
   certificates awarded by academic institutions:
   • Certificates of completion are provided to individuals to verify that they
     attended a course—these certificates do not make any claims that the individual
     actually gained knowledge and/or skills.
   • Industry and vendor certification require a solid combination of training,
     education, and experience. These certifications validate knowledge and skills
     through testing—they provide varying degrees of assurance that an individual
     has a baseline level of knowledge, skills, and abilities with regard to a
     predefined body of knowledge. The preparatory work for knowledge- or skill-
     based certifications normally includes training in a prescribed body of
     knowledge or technical curriculum, and is supplemented frequently by on-the-
     job experience.
   • Graduate certificates in information assurance (IA) are awarded by an
     academic institution to individuals who successfully complete all graduation
     requirements. These graduate certificates generally require 18 to 21 credit
     hours of academic study, have at least four required courses, allow for one or
     two electives, and may require a research paper, project, or case study.

Q. What do “professionalization” and professional development have to do
   with security?

A. Professionalization supports the need for consistency and standardization of
   policy, processes, and procedures within an agency. For security professionals,
   this professionalization trend reflects the organizational change that is taking
   place in all agencies as they place more emphasis on security and realize that
   security is a full-time job. Professionalization is accomplished through
   professional development. The movement toward professional development and
   successful certification is referred to as “professionalization.”
   Professional development integrates training, education, and experience with
   some form of assessment that validates knowledge and skills and “certifies” a
   predefined level of competence. Proper blending of awareness, training,
   education, experience, and certification promotes professional development,
   which leads to a high-performance workforce.

Q. What is the role of the information security program manager regarding
   integration of information security into the CPIC process?


Q. Is there a process for integrating security into the capital planning and
   investment control (CPIC) process?
A. Yes. There is a seven-step process for prioritizing security activities and
   corrective actions:
       1.   Identify the Baseline;
       2.   Identify Prioritization Requirements;
       3.   Conduct Enterprise-Level Prioritization;
       4.   Conduct System-Level Prioritization;
       5.   Develop Supporting Materials;
       6.   Implement Investment Review Board and Portfolio Management; and
       7.   Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management.

Q. What criteria should be evaluated when prioritizing investment planning
   possibilities?
A. Requirements must be prioritized to address the most pressing security
   investment needs first. Specific prioritization criteria will vary from agency to
   agency depending on specific agency mission and goals and applicable legislation
   and regulations. Priorities may be based on agency mission, Executive Branch
   guidance such as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), OMB guidance, or
   other external/internal priorities. Examples of security priorities include certifying
   and accrediting all systems or implementing public key infrastructure (PKI)
   throughout the enterprise. It is important to note that OMB/Executive Branch
   guidance or laws should be ranked highest among these priorities.

Q. What is the basis for information security priorities the organization
   should consider in all agency investments?
A. Priorities may be based on agency mission, executive branch guidance such as
   the PMA, OMB guidance, or other external/internal priorities. Examples of
   security priorities include certifying and accrediting all systems or implementing
   PKI throughout the enterprise. It is important to note that OMB/executive branch
   guidance or laws should be ranked highest among these priorities.




                                                                                     B-5
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


Q. What is the compliance gap?
A. The compliance gap is the difference between the desired and actual compliance
   with the security requirements. For example, if an information system has
   completed 80 percent of certification and accreditation (C&A) activities, that
   investment would have a C&A compliance gap of 20 percent. The actual
   compliance of 80 percent is subtracted from the desired compliance of 100
   percent to yield a 20 percent compliance gap. The smaller the compliance gap,
   the more compliant the system or enterprise control. For key information
   security activities, this information is part of the FISMA report.

Q. What is the corrective action impact?
A. Corrective action impact is the ratio of compliance gap to corrective action cost.
   It is calculated by dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to
   implement the corresponding corrective action(s). This ratio provides a
   proportion of result to cost. The higher the impact proportion, the more “bang
   for the buck” the corrective action will provide. The resulting proportion is
   multiplied by 100,000 to facilitate further calculations.




Q. What is the Exhibit 300?
A. The Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities
   required for full internal (investment review board [IRB], Office of the Chief
   Information Officer [OCIO]) review. More importantly, the Exhibit 300 is the
   document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding
   decisions. This document provides OMB with a robust assessment of the
   investment and is the vehicle for IT investments to justify life cycle and annual
   funding requests to OMB.

Q. What is the Exhibit 53?
A. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire IT portfolio by listing
   every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year cost information. In addition to
   containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 contains other IT
   investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (for example, legacy systems with
   costs below agency thresholds).

Q. What is the relationship between Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300?
A. OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s and determines
   appropriate funding amounts for the budget year based on the justification
   articulated. Even though the Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s are submitted to OMB
   each September, the budgeting process is not confined to the late summer
   months. Planning, acquiring, and executing information security budgets are
   year-round activities.

Q. What is the role of information security program manager regarding
   integration of information security into the CPIC process?
A. The security program manager is charged with managing information security
   throughout the agency. With regard to the CPIC process, the information security
   program manager:
   • Develops and maintains appropriate policies for addressing IT security
     throughout the investment life cycle;
      o Select Phase
               Data Sensitivity Analysis
               Privacy Impact Assessment
               Risk Assessment

Q. Can an ISA be terminated by any of the participating parties?
Q. Do both parties need to answer each item in the ISA?
Q. Are there any federal requirements regarding ISA?


Q. What is an ISA?
A. An Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) is an agreement established
   between the organizations that own and operate connected information systems
   to document the technical requirements of the interconnection. The ISA is a
   security document that specifies the requirements for connecting the information
   systems, describes the security controls that will be used to protect the systems
   and data, and contains a topographical drawing of the interconnection. It is a
   commitment between the owners of two systems to abide by specific rules of
   behavior. These rules are discretionary and should be based on risk.

Q. What are the components of ISA?
A. An ISA should contain a cover sheet followed by a document of four numbered
   sections. The information presented within those four sections should address the
   need for the interconnection and the security controls required and implemented
   to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems and data.
   The extent of the information should be sufficient for the two OAs to make a
   prudent decision about approving the interconnection. The four sections are as
   follows:
   • Section 1: Interconnection Statement of Requirements;
   • Section 2: Systems Security Considerations;
   • Section 3: Topological Drawing; and
   • Section 4: Signatory Authority.

Q. What is an MOU/MOA?
A. A Memorandum of Understanding/Memorandum of Agreement (MOU/MOA) is a
   document that defines the responsibilities of two or more organizations in
   establishing, operating, and securing a system interconnection. It defines the
   purpose of the interconnection, identifies relevant authorities, specifies the
   responsibilities of each organization, defines the apportionment of costs, and
   identifies the timeline for terminating or reauthorizing the interconnection. The




                                                                                   B-8
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   MOU/MOA documents the terms and conditions for sharing data and information
   resources and should be signed by an organizational official.

Q. What are the components of MOU/MOA?
A. Each organization may use its own MOU/MOA format, if appropriate, while
   keeping in mind that the MOU/MOA is a management document and should not
   contain technical details of the interconnection. Each section should contain
   general information. Those details should be addressed separately in the ISA. An
   MOU/MOA should contain a dated cover sheet with both participating
   organizations listed. In addition to the cover sheet, the MOU/MOA should contain
   the following sections:
   • Section 1: Supersession
     – If there is a superseded document, the title and date of the document is
       listed.
   • Section 2: Introduction
     – The introduction states the purpose of the memorandum between the parties
       and what the agreement will govern (e.g., the relationship between
       “Organization A” and “Organization B”).
   • Section 3: Authorities
     – An example for this section would be: “The authority for this agreement is
       based on "Proclamation A" issued by the Agency Head on (date).”
   • Section 4: Background
     – In the background, the parties should state the intent of the agreement
       (e.g., “it is the intent of both parties to this agreement to interconnect the
       following information systems…”).
   • Section 5: Communications
     – Frequent formal communications are essential to ensure the successful
       management and operation of the interconnection. In this section, the
       parties agree to maintain open lines of communication among designated
       staff at both the managerial and technical levels.
   • Section 6: Purpose of the ISA
     – This section states the purpose of the ISA.
   • Section 7: Security Requirement
     – Both parties agree to work together to ensure the joint security of the
       connected systems and the data they store, process, and transmit, as
       specified in the ISA. Each party should have identified security controls that
       apply to the interconnection based on each system’s information security
       categorization and impact level and agree on a mutual set of applicable
       controls.
   • Section 8: Cost Considerations
     – This section describes the terms and conditions of the associated costs of the
       interconnecting mechanism and/or media.
   • Section 9: Timeline
     – This section states the agreement’s timeline (e.g., “This agreement will
       remain in effect for one (1) year after the last date on either signature in the
       signature block below. After one (1) year, this agreement will expire…”).




                                                                                    B-9

   • Section 10: Signatory Authority
   Please note this is an abbreviated description of each section. For more
   information on each of the sections, please refer to Section 4.12.

Q. What is the difference between ISA and MOU/MOA ?
A. An ISA is used to support an MOU/MOA that establishes the requirements for
   data exchange between two organizations. The MOU/MOA is used to document
   the business and legal requirements necessary to support the business relations
   between the two organizations. The MOU/MOA should not include technical
   details regarding how the interconnection is established; that is the function of
   the ISA. An ISA is a distinct security-related document that outlines the technical
   solution and security requirements for the interconnection. It does not replace an
   MOU/MOA. As older MOUs/MOAs are updated, they should be changed to refer to
   the appropriate ISA covering the connectivity addressed by the MOU/MOA. An
   ISA can be signed only by the two AOs/DAAs (or other authorizing management
   officials as designated by the organizations involved) whose names appear in
   Section 4 of the agreement. The ISA should be formally signed before the
   interconnection is declared operational.

Q. Is it acceptable to combine the MOU/MOA and the ISA?
A. Yes. Organizations may combine ISAs and MOUs/MOAs to simplify their
   management processes and reduce paperwork. When combining ISAs and
   MOUs/MOAs, organizations must ensure that the contents and the intent of these
   two documents remain intact.

Q. When does C&A need to occur?
A. Before interconnecting their information systems, each organization should
   ensure that its respective system is properly certified and accredited in
   accordance with federal C&A guidelines. The C&A process is applicable for both
   emerging systems and those already in production. It involves a series of
   security-related activities, including developing or updating a system security
   plan, conducting a risk assessment, preparing a contingency plan, and conducting
   a security review.
   Establishing an interconnection may represent a significant change to the
   connected systems. Each organization should perform an assessment to
   determine whether recertification of the new configuration is appropriate.

Q. How often should security reviews occur?
A. One or both organizations should review the security controls for the
   interconnection at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs to
   ensure that they are operating properly and are providing appropriate levels of
   protection.

Q. What criteria should the organizations use to establish a baseline of
   minimum-security controls that must be implemented on each of the
   interconnecting systems?
A. The security controls of the interconnected systems should be evaluated and
   meet the standards of the management, operational, and technical controls of
   the highest classification between the two in accordance with NIST SP 800-53,
   Revision 1, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.


                                                                                 B-10
Appendix B                                            Frequently Asked Questions


Q. Do organizations need to update a system security plan?
A. Yes. Both organizations should update their system security plans and other
   relevant documentation at least annually or whenever there is a significant
   change to their information systems or to the interconnection. Refer to NIST SP
   800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information
   Systems, for information on updating system security plans.

Q. Do individual personal computers (PCs) connecting to an application
   housed behind a firewall through the Internet require ISA(s)?
A. No. An ISA is an agreement established between organizations rather than
   individual systems. Each system involved in interconnection is governed by an
   organization’s DAA who has the authority to formally assume responsibility for
   operating a system at an acceptable level of risk.

Q. Can an ISA be terminated by any of the participating parties?
A. Yes. The language in the ISA should stipulate how, when, and by whom the
   agreement can be terminated. This action item will be decided during the drafting
   of the agreement.

Q. Do both parties need to answer each item in the ISA?
A. Yes. Both parties need to answer each item even if the item affects only one of
   the parties.

Q. Are there any federal requirements regarding ISA?
A   Yes. ISAs must be addressed by all federal organizations. ISA requirements are
    set forth by OMB and NIST (in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended
    Security Controls for Federal Information Systems). ISAs are also mentioned in
    the FY05 FISMA Reporting Guidance. The NIST SP 800-53 requirement states:

   requirements or FISMA?
Q. Metrics help to answer three basic questions, what are they?
Q. How are the different metrics selected?
Q. Can a weighting scale be used during the selection process for metrics?
Q. Are there any specific characteristics that should be defined in each metric?

Q. How can an organization benefit from metrics?
A. Metrics bring multiple benefits to organizations, including:
   • Improving accountability for security;
   • Enabling management to pinpoint specific technical, operational, or
     management controls that are not being implemented or are being
     implemented incorrectly;
   • Justifying investment requests using quantitative vs. qualitative data;
   • Targeting investments specifically to the areas in need of improvement to
     maximize investment value; and
   • Determining the effectiveness of implemented information security processes,
     procedures, and controls by relating results of information security activities
     (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to the respective
     requirements and to information security investments.

Q. What are the interdependent components of the security metrics
   program?
A. The interdependent components of the security metrics program are:
   1. Strong upper-level management support, which establishes a focus on
      security within the highest levels of the organization;
   2. Practical security policies and procedures backed by the authority necessary
      to enforce compliance. Practical security policies and procedures are defined
      as those that are attainable and provide meaningful security through
      appropriate controls. Metrics are not easily obtainable if there are no
      procedures in place;
   3. Quantifiable performance metrics that are designed to capture and provide
      meaningful performance data. To provide meaningful data, quantifiable
      security metrics must be based on information security performance goals
      and objectives, and be easily obtainable and feasible to measure. They must
      also be repeatable, provide relevant performance trends over time, and be
      useful for tracking performance and directing resources; and
   4. Consistent, periodic analysis of the metrics data to apply lessons learned,
      improve the effectiveness of existing security controls, and plan future
      controls to meet new security requirements as they occur. Accurate data


                                                                                 B-12
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


       collection must be a priority with stakeholders and users if the collected data
       is to be meaningful to management and faciliate improvement of the overall
       security program.

Q. What do information security metrics measure?
A. Metrics measure efficiency and effectiveness, implementation, and impact of
   security activities.

Q. What is the difference between developing and implementing a metrics
   program?
A. The metrics development process establishes the initial set of metrics and selects
   the metrics subset appropriate for an organization at a given time. The metrics
   program implementation process operates a metrics program that is iterative by
   nature and ensures that appropriate aspects of information security are
   measured for a specific time period.

Q. What are the activities that comprise the information security metrics
   process?
A. The information security metrics development process consists of two major
   activities:
       1. Identification and definition of the current information security program;
          and
       2. Development and selection of specific metrics to measure implementation,
          efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the security controls.

Q. What are the activities that comprise the information security
   implementation process?
A. The information security implementation process consists of six phases:
       1.   Prepare for data collection;
       2.   Collect data and analyze results;
       3.   Identify corrective actions;
       4.   Develop business case;
       5.   Obtain resources; and
       6.   Apply corrective actions.

Q. Can the use of a metrics program assist an organization with federal
   requirements or FISMA?
A. Yes. Information security metrics will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA
   reporting requirement by providing an infrastructure for organized data
   collection, analysis and reporting. Also, information security metrics can be used
   as input into Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspectors General
   (IG) audits. Implementation of an information security metrics program will
   demonstrate agency commitment to proactive security.

Q. Metrics help answer three basic questions, what are they?
A. Metrics are one element of a manager’s toolkit for making and substantiating
   decisions. Metrics are used to answer three basic questions:
       1. Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?
       2. How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?



                                                                                  B-13
Appendix B                                              Frequently Asked Questions


       3. What impact are those tasks having on the mission of my organization?

Q. How are the different metrics selected?
A. The universe of possible metrics, based on existing policies and procedures, will
   be quite large. Metrics must be prioritized to ensure that the final set selected for
   initial implementation has the following qualities:
   • Facilitates improvement of high-priority security control implementation. High
     priority may be defined by the latest GAO or IG reports, results of a risk
     assessment, or internal organizational goal.
   • Uses data that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data
     repositories.
   • Measures processes that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring
     nonexistent or unstable processes will not provide meaningful information
     about security performance and will, therefore, not be useful for targeting
     specific aspects of performance.
   Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including C&A, security
   assessments, POA&M, incident statistics, and agency-initiated or independent
   reviews.

Q. Can a weighting scale be used during the selection process for metrics?
A. Yes. If weights were assigned to metrics in the Prepare for Data Collection phase,
   these weights should be used to prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively,
   weights may be assigned to corrective actions in the Identify Corrective Actions
   phase based on the criticality of implementing specific corrective actions, the cost
   of corrective actions, and the magnitude of corrective actions’ impact on the
   organization’s security posture.

Q. Are there any specific characteristics that should be defined in each
   metric?
A. Once applicable metrics that contain the qualities described above are identified,
   they will need to be documented with supporting detail, including frequency of
   data collection, data source, formula for calculation, implementation evidence for
   measured activity, and guide for metric data interpretation.

B.5 Security Planning – Summary of FAQs
Q. Are specific system security plans for minor applications required?
Q. What are “Rules of Behavior”?
Q. What should be considered when selecting the initial set of security controls?
Q. Can an agency tailor their security control baseline?
Q. After the information system security plan is developed, what is the next step?

Q. Are specific system security plans for minor applications required?
A. No. Specific system security plans for minor applications 89 are not required
   because the security controls for those applications are typically provided by the
   general support system (GSS) or major application (MA) in which they operate.
   In those cases where the minor application is not connected to an MA or GSS, the
   minor application should be briefly described in a GSS plan that has either a
   common physical location or is supported by the same organization.

Q. What are “Rules of Behavior”?
A. The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior or
   noncompliance and identify the formal method used by the organization to
   document the user’s understanding of the rules and associated consequences.
   The rules of behavior should be made available to all users before they receive
   authorization for access to the system.

Q. What should be considered when selecting the initial set of security
   controls?
A. The FIPS 199 impact levels must be considered when the system boundaries are
   drawn and when selecting the initial set of security controls (i.e., control
   baseline). The baseline security controls can then be tailored based on an
   assessment of risk and local conditions including organization-specific security
   requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, the availability of
   compensating controls, or special circumstances.

Q. Can an agency tailor their security control baseline?
A. Yes. An agency has the flexibility to tailor the security control baseline in
   accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the standard. Tailoring
   activities include (1) the application of scoping guidance, (2) the specification of
   compensating controls, and (3) the specification of agency-defined parameters in
   the security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should document
   all tailoring activities.
Q. After the information system security plan is developed, what is the next
   step?
A. Once the information system security plan is developed, it is important to
   periodically assess the plan; review any change in system status, functionality,
   design, etc.; and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information
   about the system. This documentation and its accuracy are critical for system
   certification activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at
   least annually.

89
     NIST SP 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than a major application, that
     requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
     unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications are
     typically included as part of a GSS.

B.6 IT Contingency Planning – Summary of FAQs
Q. What is IT contingency planning?
Q. In what time frame must systems and data be recovered and restored when a
   disruption occurs?
Q. What is the contingency planning policy statement?
Q. What is a business impact analysis (BIA)?
Q. What is maximum allowable outage (MAO)?
Q. What is the recovery time objective (RTO)?
Q. What are the components of the IT contingency plan strategy that must be
   tested?
Q. Where should backup data be stored?


Q. What is IT contingency planning?
A. IT contingency planning is one modular piece of a larger contingency and
   continuity-planning program that encompasses IT, business processes, risk
   management, financial management, crisis communications, safety and security
   of personnel and property, and continuity of government. Each piece is operative
   in its own right, but together can create a coordinated synergy that efficiently
   and effectively protects the entire organization.

Q. In what time frame must systems and data be recovered and restored
   when a disruption occurs?
A. When a disruption occurs, a recovery strategy must be implemented within the
   recovery time objective (RTO) period.

Q. What is the contingency planning policy statement?
A. The contingency planning policy statement is the first step in developing an IT
   contingency plan. This policy may exist at the department, agency, and/or
   program level of the organization. The statement should define the organizations
   overall contingency objectives; identify leadership, roles and responsibilities,
   resource requirements, test, training, and exercise schedules; and plan
   maintenance schedules and the minimum required backup frequency.

Q. What is a business impact analysis (BIA)?
A. The BIA is a critical step to understanding the information systems components,
   interdependencies, and potential downtime impacts. The contingency plan
   strategy and procedures should be designed specifically around the results of the
   BIA. A BIA is conducted by identifying the system’s critical resources. Each
   critical resource is then further examined to determine how long functionality of
   the resource could be withheld from the information system before an
   unacceptable impact is experienced.

Q. What is Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO)?
A. Based on the potential impacts, the amount of time the information system can
   be without the critical resource then provides a recourse recovery priority around
   which to plan.

Q. What is the Recovery Time Objective?
A. The balancing point between the MAO and the cost to recover establishes the
   information system’s RTO. Recovery strategies must be created to meet the


                                                                                B-16
Appendix B                                           Frequently Asked Questions


   RTO. The strategy must also address recovering information system critical
   components within a priority, as established by their individual RTOs.

Q. What are the components of the IT contingency plan strategy that must
   be tested?
A. The IT contingency plan strategy testing should include:
       1.   System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
       2.   Coordination among recovery teams;
       3.   Internal and external connectivity;
       4.   System performance using alternate equipment;
       5.   Restoration of normal operations; and
       6.   Notification procedures.

Q. Where should backup data be stored?
A. Backed up data should be stored offsite and rotated frequently. Also, stored data
   should be routinely tested to validate backed-up data integrity.

Q. Should I train and educate my personnel on IT contingency planning?
A. Yes. Personnel selected to execute the IT contingency plan must be trained to
   perform the procedures. Personnel training should include:
   • Purpose of the plan;
   • Cross-team coordination and communication;
   • Reporting procedures;
   • Security requirements;
   • Team-specific processes; and
   • Individual responsibilities.
   Plan exercises should be designed to individually and then collectively examine
   various components of the entire plan. Exercises may be conducted in a
   classroom setting: discussing specific components of the plan and/or impact
   issues; or they may be functional exercises: simulating the recovery using actual
   replacement equipment, data, and alternate sites.

B.7 Risk Management– Summary of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q. What is the principal goal of a risk management process?
Q. How many processes does risk management encompass?
Q. What options do system and organizational managers have to reduce the risk
   present on the system?
Q. Define risk mitigation and explain what steps are involved to control
   implementation.
Q. The security controls have been established. Is it possible to proceed to the final
   step of the risk management process?
Q. What is the formal definition of risk?
Q. Is it possible to calculate the likelihood of a threat exploiting a given
   vulnerability?
Q. What are the steps in the risk assessment process?
Q. How is a system described?
Q. Are there common threats to a system?
Q. What is a vulnerability?
Q. What are the levels of risk?
Q. How often is the risk assessment process conducted?


Q. What is the principal goal of a risk management process?
A. The principal goal of an organization’s risk management process should be to
   protect the organization and its ability to perform its mission, not just its
   information assets.

Q. How many processes does risk management encompass?
A. There are three processes of risk management: risk assessment, risk mitigation,
   and evaluation and assessment. When applied appropriately and with due
   diligence, the processes should meet the Federal Information Security
   Management Act (FISMA) requirements of “providing information security
   protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting
   from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction
   of…information…and…information systems” collected by and used by the federal
   government and “ensuring that information security management processes are
   integrated with agency strategic and operational planning processes.”

Q. What options do system and organizational managers have to reduce the
   risk present on the system?
A. System and organizational managers may use several options to reduce the risk
   present on a system. These options are risk assumption, risk avoidance, risk
   limitation, risk planning, research and acknowledgement, and risk transference.

Q. Define risk mitigation and explain what steps are involved to control
   implementation.
A. The second process in the overall risk management process is that of risk
   mitigation. Because it is impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate all risks from
   a system, risk mitigation strives to prioritize, evaluate, and implement the
   appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment
   process based on NIST SP 800-53 guidance. Once the decision has been made
   on which risks are to be addressed in the risk mitigation process, a seven-step
   approach is used to guide control implementation:


                                                                                    B-18
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


       1.   Prioritize actions;
       2.   Evaluate recommended control options;
       3.   Conduct cost-benefit analysis;
       4.   Select control;
       5.   Assign responsibility;
       6.   Develop a safeguard implementation plan; and
       7.   Implement selected control(s).

Q. The security controls have been established. Is it possible to proceed to
   the final step of the risk management process?
A. No. It is important to note that even after the controls have been selected and
   implemented, some degree of residual risk will remain. It is impractical to
   assume that all risk will be eliminated and the remaining residual risk should be
   analyzed to ensure that it is at an acceptable level. For federal agencies, after
   the appropriate controls have been put in place for the identified risks, the
   authorizing official will sign a statement accepting any residual risk and authorize
   the operation of the new information system or the continued processing of the
   existing information system. If the residual risk has not been reduced to an
   acceptable level, the risk management cycle must be repeated to identify a way
   of lowering the residual risk to an acceptable level.

Q. What is the formal definition of risk?
A. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
   800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, defines
   risk as, “a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source’s exercising a
   particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event
   on the organization.”

Q. Is it possible to calculate the likelihood of a threat exploiting a given
   vulnerability?
A. Yes. The likelihood of a given threat successfully exploiting a given vulnerability
   is estimated by evaluating the threat’s motivation, opportunity, and methods for
   conducting such exploitation. The impact of a successful exploitation is estimated
   through an analysis of the effect the exploitation can have on the confidentiality,
   integrity, and availability of the system and the data it processes.

Q. What are the steps in the risk assessment process?
A. The risk assessment process has six steps:
   • Step 1: System characterization;
   • Step 2: Threat identification;
   • Step 3: Vulnerability identification;
   • Step 4: Control analysis, likelihood determination, impact analysis, risk
     determination;
   • Step 5: Control recommendations; and
   • Step 6: Results documentation.

Q. How is a system described?
A. The system is described in terms of its hardware; software; interfaces to other
   systems, data, people, mission; and criticality and sensitivity (as previously
   described using FIPS 199 to determine the system’s appropriate security
   categorization). In addition, the system’s functional requirements; security


                                                                                  B-19
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   policy and architecture; network topology; information flows; security controls in
   terms of management, operational, and technical controls; and physical and
   environmental security mechanisms are described.
Q. Are there common threats to a system?
A. Yes. There are common threat sources that typically apply, regardless of the
   system that should be evaluated. These common threats can be categorized into
   three areas: (1) natural threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides,
   avalanches, electrical storms), (2) human threats (intentional or unintentional),
   and (3) environmental threats (e.g., power failure).

Q. What is a vulnerability?
A. NIST SP 800-30 defines vulnerability as “a flaw or weakness in system security
   procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised
   (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach
   or a violation of the system’s security policy.”

Q. What are the levels of risk?
A. This risk scale, with its ratings of High, Moderate, and Low, represents the degree
   or level of risk to which an information system, facility, or procedure might be
   exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk scale also presents
   actions that senior management, the mission owners, must take for each risk
   level. The risk descriptions and associated necessary actions are:
   • High: If an observation or finding is evaluated as a high risk, there is a strong
     need for corrective measures. An existing system may continue to operate, but
     a corrective action plan must be put in place as soon as possible.
   • Moderate: If an observation is rated as moderate risk, corrective actions are
     needed and a plan must be developed to incorporate these actions within a
     reasonable period of time.
   • Low: If an observation is described as low risk, the system’s authorizing official
     must determine whether corrective actions are still required or decide to accept
     the risk.

Q. How often is the risk assessment process conducted?
A. As mandated by OMB Circular A-130, the risk assessment process is usually
   repeated at least every three years for federal agencies. However, risk
   assessments should be conducted and integrated into the SDLC for information
   systems, not because it is required by law or regulation, but because it is a good
   practice and supports the organization’s business objectives or mission.

B.8 Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments – Summary of
    Frequently Asked Questions
Q. What is security certification?
Q. What is security accreditation?
Q. Are there any necessary activities to support security accreditation?
Q. What are the phases of the certification and accreditation process?
Q. What is included in a security accreditation package?
Q. What is the Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire?
Q. Do all the 800-53 security controls need annual testing to satisfy the FISMA
   annual testing requirement?
Q. What factors should be considered when using an automated system assessment
   reporting tool?
Q. What key security-related activities should be completed before a system is
   assessed?
Q. Can the System Reporting Form be customized by the organization?


Q. What is security certification?
A. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management,
   operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in
   support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls
   are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
   outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The
   results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the
   system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to
   render a security accreditation decision.
Q. What is security accreditation?
A. Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior
   agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly
   accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the
   implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. By accrediting an
   information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of
   the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a
   breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core
   principles that characterize security accreditation.

Q. Are there any necessary activities to support security accreditation?
A. Yes. The assessment of risk and the development of system security plans are
   two important activities in an agency’s information security program that directly
   support security accreditation and are required by FISMA and OMB Circular
   A-130, Appendix III.
   Risk assessments influence the development of the security controls for
   information systems and generate much of the information needed for the
   associated system security plans. Risk assessments can be accomplished in a
   variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the agency. The assessment
   of risk is a process that should be incorporated into the SDLC. At a minimum,
   documentation should be produced that describes the process used and the
   results obtained.




                                                                                   B-21
Appendix B                                            Frequently Asked Questions


   System security plans provide an overview of the information security
   requirements and describe the security controls that are in place or planned for
   meeting those requirements. System security plans can include as references or
   attachments, other important security-related documents that are produced as
   part of an agency’s information security program (e.g., risk assessments,
   contingency plans, incident response plans, security awareness and training
   plans, information system rules of behavior, configuration management (CM)
   plans, security configuration checklists, privacy impact assessments, system
   interconnection agreements).

Q. What are the phases of the C&A process?
A. The security C&A process consists of four distinct phases:
       1. Initiation Phase. This phase will ensure that the authorizing official and
          senior agency information security officer agree with the contents of the
          system security plan before the certification agent begins assessing the
          security controls in the information system.
       2. Security Certification Phase. This phase will determine the extent to which
          the security controls in the information system are implemented correctly,
          operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
          meeting the security requirements for the system.
       3. Security Accreditation Phase. This phase will determine whether the
          remaining known vulnerabilities in the information system (after the
          implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls) pose an
          acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
          individuals.
       4. Continuous Monitoring Phase. This phase will provide regular oversight
          and monitoring of the security controls in the information system and will
          inform the authorizing official when changes may impact the security of
          the system.

Q. What is included in a security accreditation package?
A. The security accreditation package contains the following documents: approved
   system security plan, the security assessment report, and the POA&M. After
   these documents are completed, the information system owner submits the final
   security accreditation package to the authorizing official or a designated
   representative.

Q. What is the Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire?
A. To assist agencies in meeting their annual FISMA reporting requirements, the
   Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire (Annex 11.A) provides
   questions on many of the areas typically required for inclusion in agency reports.

Q. Do all the 800-53 security controls need annual testing to satisfy the
   FISMA annual testing requirement?
A. All 800-53 security controls do not need to be tested to satisfy annual testing and
   evaluation requirements. Agencies should first prioritize testing on POA&M items
   that become closed. These newly implemented controls should be validated.
   Agencies should test against system related security control changes that
   occurred but did not constitute a major change necessitating a new C&A.
   Agencies should identify all security controls that are continuously monitored as
   annual testing and evaluation activities. Examples of this include (but are not



                                                                                 B-22
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   limited to) ongoing security training, Denial of Service and Malicious Code
   protection activities, Intrusion Detection monitoring, Log File reviews, etc. Once
   this is completed agencies should look at the remaining controls that have not
   been tested for that year and make a decision on further annual testing based on
   risk, importance of control and date of last test.

Q. What factors should be considered when using an automated system
   assessment reporting tool?
A. Automated tools can be used to support the assessment process and provide for
   easier roll-up of data for internal or external reporting. Factors to consider in
   using automated tools include:
   • Ascertaining the completeness of tool functionality in terms of supporting all
     components listed in NIST SP 800-53A;
   • Determining who will have access to the tools, including specific roles and
     responsibilities;
   • Ensuring that the system processing the tool is secure and is certified and
     accredited;
   • Providing adequate training for those using the tool(s); and
   • Establishing technical support capability.

Q. What key security-related activities should be completed before a system
   is assessed?
A. Before a system is assessed, there are key security-related activities that should
   be completed. An inventory of all systems should be conducted, and then all
   systems should be categorized according to their impact on the agency’s mission.
   A determination must then be made as to the boundaries of the system, keeping
   in mind the impact of the information stored within, processed by, or transmitted
   by the system(s). A completed GSS or MA security plan, which is required under
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, should describe the boundaries of the system,
   the impact level of the data, and the security controls in place or planned for the
   system.
Q. Can the System Reporting Form be customized by the organization?
A. Yes. The System Reporting Form may be customized by the organization. An
   organization can add more security controls to those listed for each control
   family, require more descriptive information, and even pre-mark certain security
   controls if applicable. Additional columns may be added to reflect the status of
   the control, e.g., planned action date or location of documentation. The System
   Reporting Form should not have security controls removed or modified to reduce
   the effectiveness of the control.

Q. What is an organizational conflict of interest (OCI)?
Q. What is a service agreement?
Q: Why should security products be used?
Q. What important steps should be taken while selecting a security product?
Q. Who should be involved during the security product selection process?

Q. What must be considered when managing a security services project?
A. The importance of systematically managing the information security services
   process cannot be underestimated because of the potential impact on the
   organization if the many issues involved are not properly considered and the
   organizational risks are not managed. Information security decision makers must
   think about not only the costs involved and the underlying security requirements,
   but also the impact of their decisions on the organizational mission, operations,
   strategic functions, personnel, and service provider arrangements.

Q. What are the steps in the security services life cycle?
A. The information security services life cycle provides a framework around which
   the various information security decision makers can organize their information
   security efforts—from initiation to closeout. The steps for the life cycle are:
       1.   Initiation Phase: Determining the need;
       2.   Assessment Phase: Identifying viable solutions;
       3.   Solution Phase: Specifying the right solution;
       4.   Implementation Phase: Engaging the right source;
       5.   Operations Phase: Ensuring operational success; and
       6.   Closeout Phase: Ensuring successful closure.

Q. What should take place before selecting a security service?
A. Before selecting specific services, organizations should review the current status
   of their security programs and the security controls that are planned or in place
   to protect information and information systems. Organizations should use the
   risk management process to identify the most effective mix of management,
   operational, and technical security controls that will mitigate risk to an acceptable
   level. The number and type of appropriate security controls and their
   corresponding information security services may vary throughout a particular
   system’s services life cycle. The relative maturity of an organization’s security
   architecture may influence the types of appropriate security controls.

Q. Are there security services categories?
A. Yes. Security services are divided into three categories: management,
   operational, and technical services. Characteristics of each service are listed
   below:
   • Management Services are techniques and concerns normally addressed by
     management in the organization’s computer security program. They focus on
     managing the computer security program and the risk within the organization.



                                                                                     B-24
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   • Operational Services are focused on controls implemented and executed by
     people (as opposed to systems). They often require technical or specialized
     expertise and rely on management activities and technical controls.
   • Technical Services are focused on the security controls an information system
     executes. These services are dependent on the proper function of the system
     for effectiveness.

Q. What is an organizational conflict of interest (OCI)?
A. An OCI may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present, or future
   interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish
   the capacity to provide impartial, technically sound, objective service, or results
   in an unfair competitive advantage. Of course, it is best to avoid organizational
   conflicts before they arise.

Q. What is a service agreement?
A. A service agreement is the agreement between the service provider and the
   organization requesting the service. As service arrangements become more
   complex and employ commercial service providers, the formality of the
   agreement should increase. A fully externalized service arrangement with a
   commercial entity, for example, will require a formal contract so that managers
   can hold service providers accountable for their actions.

Q. Why should security products be used?
A. Security products should be selected and used within the organization’s overall
   program to manage the design, development, and maintenance of its information
   security infrastructure, and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
   availability of its mission-critical information.

Q. What important steps should be taken while selecting a security
   product?
A. It is important to perform a cost-benefit analysis when selecting security
   products. As part of the cost-benefit analysis, a life cycle cost (LCC) estimate for
   the status quo and each alternative identified should be developed. In addition to
   LCC estimates, benefits associated with each alternative should be identified and,
   to the extent practicable, quantified in terms of dollar savings or cost avoidance.
   Once the necessary controls are identified, information security products can be
   identified to provide for these controls.

Q. Who should be involved during the security product selection process?
A. Product selection involves numerous people throughout an organization.
   Depending on its needs, an organization may include all of the following
   personnel or a combination of particular positions relevant to information security
   needs: information security program manager, chief information officer, IT
   investment review board (or equivalent), program manager/system owner/data,
   owner/procurement initiator, acquisition personnel, contracting officer,
   contracting officer’s technical representative, or system security officer.

   incidents?
Q. Is it possible to prepare for incident response?
Q. What should be included in the incident response policy?
Q. What elements should be considered when selecting a team structure and
   staffing model?


Q. What are the four phases of the incident response life cycle?
A. NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, states that the four
   phases of the incident response life cycle are:
   • Preparation;
   • Detection and Analysis;
   • Containment, Eradication, and Recovery; and
   • Post-Incident Recovery.

Q. What are some practices that may prevent incidents?
A. Examples of practices that help to prevent incidents are:
   • Having a patch management program to assist system administrators in
     identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying patches that eliminate known
     vulnerabilities in systems and applications;
   • Hardening all hosts appropriately to eliminate vulnerabilities and configuration
     weaknesses;
   • Configuring the network perimeter to deny all activity that is not expressly
     permitted;
   • Deploying software throughout the organization to detect and stop malicious
     code; and
   • Making users aware of policies and procedures concerning the appropriate use
     of networks, systems, and applications.

Q. Why is it important to have an incident response capability?
A. Policy guidance issued by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, requires that
   agencies have a capability to provide help to users when security incidents occur
   in their systems and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and
   threats.

Q. What does an incident response capability do?
A. A well-defined incident response capability helps an organization detect incidents
   rapidly, minimize losses and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore IT
   operations without delay.




                                                                                    B-26
Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


Q. What are federal civilian agencies accountable for in terms of reporting
   security incidents?
A. According to OMB Memorandum 05-15, FY 2005 Reporting Instructions for the
   Federal Information Security and Management Act Report and Privacy
   Management Report (June 13, 2005), agencies must identify and report the total
   number of successful incidents in the following categories: unauthorized access,
   denial of service attacks, malicious code, improper usage, or other, consistent
   with NIST Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
   (January 2004). Successful incidents must be recorded and reported internally,
   to US-CERT, and depending on their severity, to law enforcement. As stated in
   the US-CERT Concept of Operations, each incident category has a specific
   timeframe of when it needs to be reported to US-CERT. These time frames are
   as follows:
   • Unauthorized Access: Within one (1) hour of discovery and/or detection;
   • Denial of Service: Within two (2) hours of discovery and/or detection;
   • Malicious Code: Daily or within one (1) hour if discovery and/or detection is
     widespread; and
   • Improper Usage: On a weekly basis.
   In addition, agencies must report Scans/Probes/Attempted Access on a monthly
   basis or within one (1) hour of discover if it is a classified system.
   In addition, a system-specific incident response plan is considered an integral
   part of a complete system certification and accreditation package.

Q. Is it possible to prepare for incident response?
A. Yes. To prepare for incident response, the organization should do the following:
   • Create an organization-specific definition of the term “incident” so that the
     scope of the term is clear;
   • Create an incident response policy;
   • Develop incident response and reporting procedures;
   • Set guidelines for communicating with external parties;
   • Determine incident response team services;
   • Select a team structure and staffing model; and
   • Staff and train the incident response team.

Q. What should be included in the incident response policy?
A. An incident response policy should define which events are considered incidents,
   establish the organizational structure for incident response, define roles and
   responsibilities, and list the requirements for reporting incidents.

Q. What elements should be considered when selecting a team structure
   and staffing model?
A. The organization should select the appropriate team structure and staffing
   models based on several factors, including the size of the organization, the
   geographic diversity of major computing resources, the need for 24/7 availability,
   cost, and staff expertise.

B.11 Configuration Management (CM) – Summary of FAQs
Q. What is configuration management?
Q. Why is configuration management important?
Q. What should be considered and taken into account when developing a
   configuration management process?
Q. What steps should be performed before implementing a change?
Q. Is configuration management required by all federal organizations?
Q. Is configuration management a security function?
Q. What are the steps in the configuration management process?
Q. What constitutes a “change”?
Q. What should be evaluated during an impact analysis of the proposed change?
Q. A change has just been implemented, is the job complete?


Q. What is configuration management?
A. NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development
   Life Cycle, states, “Configuration management and control procedures are critical
   to establishing an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware
   components for the information system and subsequently to controlling and
   maintaining an accurate inventory of any changes to the system. Changes to the
   hardware, software, or firmware of a system can have a significant impact on the
   security of the system…changes should be documented, and their potential
   impact on security should be assessed regularly.”

Q. Why is configuration management important?
A. With the complexity and uniqueness of each information system (often due to
   various user accounts and privileges, department software, or a user’s personal
   preferences), it is difficult for each system to be identically configured to all
   others on any given network. CM needs to exist to minimize the effects on an
   information system or network due to these changes or differences in
   configurations. With multiple system platforms, each differing item (hardware or
   software) poses a potential vulnerability that can be compromised and
   significantly affect a network.

Q. What should be taken into account when developing a configuration
   management process?
A. Each organization must take into account the associated costs and expenses, the
   required planning and scheduling, and the necessary training associated with a
   thorough and effective CM process.

Q. What steps should be performed before implementing a change?
A. It is very important to test possible configuration changes before implementing
   them. The assigned changes should be tested in a controlled environment to
   ensure minimal risk of an adverse effect.

Q. Is configuration management required by all federal organizations?
A. Yes. CM requirements are set forth by OMB and NIST and must be addressed by
   all federal organizations. NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended Security
   Controls for Federal Information Systems, defines seven CM controls that




                                                                                B-28
Appendix B                                            Frequently Asked Questions


   organizations are required to implement based on an information system’s
   security categorization.

Q. Is configuration management a security function?
A. No. Although not traditionally regarded as a security function, CM needs to be
   included in the SDLC due to its strong security implications. CM is just one
   component of an information system’s security posture. It falls under the
   operational controls of an information system and is interrelated with numerous
   other security disciplines, such as project management, risk management, C&A,
   and security awareness training.

Q. What are the steps in the configuration management process?
A. The CM process identifies the steps required to ensure all changes are properly
   requested, evaluated, and authorized. The CM process also provides a detailed,
   step-by-step procedure for identifying, processing, tracking, and documenting
   changes. The following steps comprise the CM process:
   • Identify change;
   • Evaluate change request;
   • Implementation decision;
   • Implement approved change request; and
   • Continuous monitoring.

Q. What constitutes a “change”?
A. A change may consist of various things: from updating the fields or records of a
   database to upgrading the operating system with the latest security patches.

Q. What should be evaluated during an impact analysis of the proposed
   change?
A. During an impact analysis, one should look for the following:
   • Whether the change is viable and improves the performance or the security of
     the system;
   • Whether the change is technically correct, necessary, and feasible within the
     system constraints;
   • Whether system security will be affected by the change;
   • Whether associated costs for implementing the change were given
     consideration; and
   • Whether security components are affected by the change.

Q. A change has just been implemented, is the job complete?
A. No. The system should be continuously monitored to ensure that it is operating
   as intended and that changes that have been implemented do not have an
   adverse effect on the performance of the system. Configuration verification and
   audits should be performed during this step to ensure that the updates to the
   system have not adversely affected the system. Verification and audits consist of
   an examination of system characteristics and the supporting documentation to
   verify that the configuration meets users’ needs, and that the current
   configuration is the approved system configuration baseline.
