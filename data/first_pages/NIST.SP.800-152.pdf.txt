Executive Summary
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cryptographic Key Management
project covers major aspects of managing the cryptographic keys that protect sensitive,
unclassified federal information. Associated with each key is specific information (e.g., the
identifier associated with its owner, its length, and acceptable uses) called metadata. The
computers, software, modules, communications, and roles assumed by one or more authorized
individuals when managing and using cryptographic key management services are collectively
called a Cryptographic Key Management System (CKMS).

This Profile for U. S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (FCKMSs) has been
prepared to assist CKMS designers and implementers in selecting the features to be provided in
their “products,” and to assist federal organizations and their contractors when procuring,
installing, configuring, operating, and using FCKMSs. Other organizations may use this Profile
as desired.

An FCKMS can be owned and operated by a federal organization or by a private contractor that
provides key management services for federal organizations or other contractors performing
federal information-processing services.

This Profile can also be used by agencies and organizations to understand their FCKMSs, and to
adopt, adapt and migrate their FCKMSs to comply with the Profile requirements over time.
NIST does not expect that these requirements would be implemented immediately, but that
agencies would use these requirements when creating or procuring FCKMSs or FCKMS services
for their Enterprise Architectures.

This Profile is based on NIST Special Publication 800-130, A Framework for Designing
Cryptographic Key Management Systems. The Framework specifies topics that should be
considered by a CKMS designer when selecting the capabilities that a CKMS will have and the
cryptographic key management services it will support. This Profile replicates all of the
Framework requirements that must be satisfied in a CKMS and its design documentation, and
includes additional information about installing, configuring, operating and maintaining an
FCKMS.

The Framework and this Profile could be used by other organizations that have security
requirements similar to those specified in these documents or could be used as a model for the
development of other profiles.

1 Introduction
This Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (FCKMSs1) is based
on [SP 800-130], entitled “A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management
Systems (CKMS),” which provides a foundation for designing and implementing CKMSs.
The Framework specifies requirements for designing any commercial or Federal CKMS,
while this Profile provides more-specific design requirements for an FCKMS, and includes
additional requirements for testing, procuring, installing, managing, operating, maintaining,
and using FCKMSs.

This Profile specifies requirements for all FCKMSs. It is intended to assist CKMS designers
and implementers to select and support appropriate security services and key-management
functions, and to assist FCKMS procurers, administrators, service-providing organizations,
and service-using organizations to select appropriate CKMSs or CKMS services. This Profile
specifies requirements for all organizations desiring to operate or use an FCKMS, either
directly or under contract; makes recommendations for Federal organizations having special
security needs and desiring to augment the base security and key-management services; and
suggests additional FCKMS features that may be desirable for Federal organizations to
implement and use now or in the future

This Profile can be used by agencies and organizations to understand their FCKMSs, and to
adopt, adapt and migrate their FCKMSs to comply with the Profile requirements over time.
NIST does not expect that these requirements would be implemented immediately, but that
agencies would use these requirements when creating or procuring FCKMSs or FCKMS
services for their Enterprise Architectures. Agencies can also use these requirements to
assess and understand potential gaps that exist in their current FCKMSs. As agencies plan
for changes, migrations and upgrades, these requirements and the gap assessment can be used
to improve the security of FCKMs overall.

This Profile is intended to:
    1. Assist CKMS designers and implementers in supporting appropriate key and
       metadata management functions, cryptographic key types, key metadata, and
       protocols for protecting sensitive U.S. Federal computing applications and data;
    2. Establish requirements for FCKMS testing, procurement, installation, configuration,
       administration, operation, maintenance and usage;
    3. Facilitate an easy comparison of one FCKMS with another by analyzing their designs
       and implementations in order to understand how each meets the Framework and
       Profile requirements; and
    4. Assist in understanding what is needed to evaluate, procure, install, configure,
       administer, operate, and use an FCKMS that manages the cryptographic keys that
       protect sensitive and valuable data obtained, processed, stored, and used by U.S.
       Federal organizations and their contractors.

 A CKMS is intended to be the system designed and built by a CKMS designer and implementer, while an
FCKMS is the system used by the Federal government, after the CKMS has been designed and configured to be
compliant with Federal needs.

SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   5. Assist Agencies in performing an initial assessment of their FCKMSs to clearly
      understand where potential gap areas might exist, where there are areas for potential
      improvements and to understand requirements for future migrations, procurements
      and upgrades to their FCKMSs.

Designing a secure CKMS is the responsibility of CKMS designers, who must choose among
various key-management capabilities to be included in a product being designed for a
particular market. Purchasing an acceptable FCKMS or FCKMS service is the responsibility
of Federal procurement officials and their technical associates. Managing/administering an
FCKMS is the responsibility of appropriate FCKMS service providers when installing,
configuring, operating, and maintaining an FCKMS.

This Profile is based on the Framework, and readers of this Profile are strongly encouraged to
be familiar with the information in the Framework. The Framework contains tutorial
information that may be needed to understand the cryptographic key-management topics of
this Profile. This Profile introduces each topic that is also covered in the Framework.

The Framework and this Profile could be used by other organizations that have security
requirements similar to those specified in these documents, and the Profile could be used as a
model for the development of other profiles.

1.1   Profile Terminology

The Profile often uses terminology that is not used in the Framework. A glossary of terms is
provided in Appendix B, but some of the more general terms merit an introduction below.

“CKMS” is used to mean any Cryptographic Key Management System that satisfies the
requirements of the Framework. The term refers to the system that is designed and
implemented, possibly with configurable options.

An “FCKMS” performs the key and metadata functions that are the foundation of all
cryptographic key-management services needed by one or more Federal service-using
organizations and their employees.

An FCKMS includes a CKMS, possibly after configuring the CKMS functions to support the
desired services of a Federal service-using organization. An FCKMS also meets all the
requirements of this Profile for its impact-level and provides FCKMS services for a U.S.
Federal organization and/or its contractors.

This Profile uses the terms “FCKMS service-providing organization” (or “FCKMS service
provider”) and “FCKMS service-using organization”. An FCKMS service provider may be a
part of an FCKMS service-using organization or may be an independent organization
providing the services required by FCKMS service-using organizations (e.g., under contract).
Federal CKMS service providers may be Federal organizations, Federal contractors, or both.
This Profile includes requirements for both FCKMS service providers and FCKMS service-
using organizations.

SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


This Profile uses the term “impact-level” to refer to the information-system impact-levels
identified in [FIPS 200]. [FIPS 200] uses the security categories in [FIPS 199] to specify and
define three information-system impact-levels: Low, Moderate and High. The security
categories are based on the potential impact on an organization if certain events occur that
jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain
its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.

The Profile uses the term “security control” to refer to the security controls provided in [SP
800-53] that support the executive agencies of the Federal government to meet the
requirements of [FIPS 200]. [SP 800-53], and [SP 800-53A] apply to all components of an
information system that process, store, or transmit Federal information.

The term “FIPS-140 security level” refers to the security levels defined for cryptographic
modules in [FIPS 140]. Four levels are defined, where a level 1 cryptographic module
provides the least amount of protection, and a level 4 module provides the greatest amount of
protection. The cryptographic modules and their implemented FIPS-140 security levels are
validated by NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

The term “security strength” is used to measure the amount of cryptographic protection that
can be provided by a combination of a cryptographic algorithm and a key. Further discussion
of key strengths is provided in [SP 800-57 Part 1].

In CKMS and FCKMS topic discussions, statements of fact are indicated by “is” or “are”;
statements of permission or of possibility are indicated by “may”; statements of capability
are indicated by “can”. Statements including “could” are used in discussing possible optional
or alternative actions. These terms do not indicate requirements or recommendations of this
publication.

1.2    Scope of this Profile

An FCKMS is intended for use by Federal agencies and contractors (who use cryptography
to protect U.S. government information) to manage all the cryptographic keys and associated
metadata.

While individual people are outside the scope of an FCKMS, the roles assumed by these
people (e.g., administrators, managers, operators, auditors, and users) are within the scope of
an FCKMS. Physical and logical interfaces between an FCKMS and any or all these roles are
also within an FCKMS’s scope.

Federal agencies and their contractors are required to select appropriate [FIPS 199] impact
levels for their information and to select security controls from those identified in [SP 800-
53] to use in procurements, implementations and planning. After selecting the applicable
security control(s), organizations can initiate the tailoring process to appropriately modify
and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organization (i.e.,
conditions related to organizational missions/business functions, information systems, or
environments of operation). This Profile addresses the selection of several of the security
controls specified in [SP 800-53], indicating the minimum requirements for those security

controls for each impact level. Other security controls not specifically addressed herein
should be selected as appropriate for the organization's systems.

1.3   Audience

This Profile is intended for CKMS designers and implementers, as well as FCKMS
procurers, installers, configuration personnel, administrators, managers, operators, and users.

Federal employees and Federal contractors are the anticipated users of the services provided
by an FCKMS. Members of the public sector could be authorized to use the services of an
FCKMS when interacting with Federal organizations and their contractors.

2 Profile Basics
This Profile provides a structured view of a Federal CKMS, discussing security provisions
that shall, should or could be used by a Federal organization or contractor to manage and
protect cryptographic keys and metadata.

2.1    Profile Topics and Requirements, Augmentations, and Features

This Profile consists of a set of topics that is similar to the topics found in the Framework.
Each topic heading is typically followed by an overview of the topic, a list of Framework
requirements from [SP 800-130], a list of Profile requirements, a list of recommended Profile
augmentations, and a list of possible Profile features. In some cases, there may be no
requirements, augmentations, or features that apply to the topic.

Framework requirements for CKMSs are indicated by “shall” or “shall not,” and are
numbered beginning with an “FR” designation. Profile requirements for all FCKMSs are
indicated by “shall” or “shall not,” and are numbered beginning with a “PR” designation.
Some Profile requirements are conditional (e.g., based on the applicable [FIPS 200] impact-
level). Only the Framework requirements and the non-conditional Profile requirements are
necessary to conform to and comply with this document. A CKMS design conforming to this
Profile, must support a configuration that is compatible with both sets of requirements.
Recommended augmentations are indicated by “should,” and are numbered beginning with a
“PA” designation. Recommended augmentations are strongly recommended by NIST for
implementation in most systems. Possible features are indicated by “could,” and are
numbered beginning with a “PF” designation. Profile features are optional features that are
often intended for complex or future systems. Their possible implementation, if desired, is
left to the stakeholders of the system. Federal CKMS service-using organizations could
selectively require that their FCKMSs support some of the recommended augmentations or
suggested features, but such requirements are beyond the scope of this document.

In order to easily recognize Profile requirements, augmentations and features from the
surrounding text, each type is presented in separate tables. For each table:
        Column one provides the PR, PA or PF number;
        Column two identifies any related security controls in [SP 800-53]; when column two
         is blank, no related security control has been identified; and
        Column three provides the text of the requirement, augmentation or feature.
The first Framework requirement and the first Profile requirement, recommended
augmentation and suggested feature are concerned with the overall conformance to the
Framework and Profile.

FR:1.1 A conformant CKMS design shall meet all “shall” requirements of the Framework
[SP 800-130].

                           A Federal CKMS shall satisfy all Framework requirements
PR:2.1
                           (FRs) and Profile requirements (PRs).

2.2    Rationale for Cryptographic Key Management

Today’s information systems require protection against the denial of authorized use of their
services; unauthorized access to, or modification of, their information processing capabilities;
and unauthorized destruction of their equipment and facilities. The information systems
themselves must also protect the information that they contain from unauthorized disclosure,
modification, and destruction. These protections may be provided by physical means, such as
enclosures, locks, and guards, or they can be provided by logical means, such as
cryptography or software-based access control.

Cryptography is the only means for protecting data during transmission when physical
protection is cost-prohibitive or impossible to provide. Thus, cryptography is widely used
when business is conducted or sensitive information is transmitted over a network.
Cryptography also provides excellent protection for stored data against entities that are not
authorized to obtain or modify the data.

Cryptographic protection for data requires algorithms designed specifically for that purpose.
These algorithms often require the use of cryptographic keys, which are managed by an
FCKMS. The combination of the cryptographic algorithms and keys of an appropriate length
can be used to provide a level of protection for data; this level is commonly referred to as the
security strength (see [SP 800-57 Part1] for additional information).

Cryptographic-based security requires the secure management of keys throughout their
lifetime. Cryptography can reduce the scope of information management from protecting
large amounts of information to protecting a key and its associated metadata (i.e.,
information about the key). This Profile specifies requirements for the management of the
keys used to protect sensitive Federal information and the metadata associated with those
keys.

FR:2.1 The CKMS design shall specify all cryptographic algorithms and supported key sizes
for each algorithm used by the system.

FR:2.2 The CKMS design shall specify the estimated security strength of each cryptographic
technique that is employed to protect keys and their bound metadata.

Among the initial requirements for this Profile are requirements for the use of NIST-
approved cryptography and the minimum security strengths required for each [FIPS 199]
impact level.



                                               7
SP 800-152                                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


The current minimum security strength recommended for Federal applications is 112 bits;
this minimum has been required for the protection of Low impact-level information and
allows the use of a range of algorithms and key lengths commonly in use that provide at least
112 bit of security, including three-key Triple DEA for encryption and 2048-bit RSA.

For Moderate impact-level information, at least128 bits of security is required, which allows,
for example, the use of AES-128 for encryption and 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman for key
establishment.

While 128 bits of security might also be currently acceptable for most High-level
information, it is anticipated that future technology (e.g., quantum computers) will
necessitate a higher level of protection for High-impact level information (either 192 or 256
bits of security). This Recommendation requires at least 192 bits of security for the
protection of High-impact information in order to align with [Suite B].

                    SC-13        A Federal CKMS shall support NIST-approved cryptographic
PR:2.2
                                 algorithms, key-establishment schemes and modes of
                                 operation (as needed) in accordance with [SP 800-131A].
                                 In a Federal CKMS, information (including loaded code and
PR:2.3
                                 parameters) rated at a Low impact-level shall be protected
                                 with cryptographic algorithms and keys that provide at least
                                 112 bits of security strength.
                                 In a Federal CKMS, information (including loaded code and
PR:2.4
                                 parameters) rated at a Moderate impact-level shall be
                                 protected with cryptographic algorithms and keys that provide
                                 at least 128 bits of security strength.
                                 In a Federal CKMS, information (including loaded code and
PR:2.5
                                 parameters) rated at a High impact-level shall be protected
                                 with cryptographic algorithms and keys that provide at least
                                 192 bits of security strength.

    2.3   Keys, Metadata, Trusted Associations, and Bindings

Cryptographic keys are used when applying cryptographic protection to information 2 or
processing already-protected information3. All keys require integrity protection that should
be verified before a key is used. Secret and private keys also require confidentiality
protection. Before a key is used, the source of the key should be authenticated.

Information about a cryptographic key that specifies its characteristics, acceptable uses, and
applicable parameters must be associated with the key. This information is called the key’s
metadata, and each descriptive item is called a metadata element. A key and its metadata

2
  For example, encrypting plaintext information to protect its confidentiality, or signing the information to
protect its integrity and verify its source.
3
  For example, decrypting ciphertext to obtain the original plaintext, or verifying a signature to assure its
continued integrity.
                                                         8
SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


must be logically or cryptographically linked together and then protected, either
cryptographically or physically. These operations are further discussed in Section 6.4.10.

A metadata element for a key could be implicitly known by the FCKMS, but is often
explicitly associated and stored with the key. Some metadata elements are sensitive to
unauthorized disclosure and, therefore, require confidentiality protection. Like keys,
metadata needs protection against unauthorized modification, and the source should be
authenticated before the metadata is used. The amount of protection provided to a key and
its metadata should be commensurate with the [FIPS 199] security category and [FIPS 200]
information-system impact-level of the data being protected by that key and its metadata.

Keys are considered as being either static or ephemeral. Static keys are typically used
multiple times and are considered as being “long-term” keys. Ephemeral keys are usually
generated when needed and used only once; they are considered to be “short-term” keys.

A trusted association must be established between each static key and its metadata when they
are created by the FCKMS, and this association should be maintained throughout the lifetime
of the key. A trusted association can be established by a cryptographic binding between a key
and its metadata (e.g., a digital signature computed on a key and its metadata), or by a trusted
process (e.g., a face-to-face handover of metadata from an entity who is known and trusted).
An FCKMS should provide cryptographic binding and verification functions that are used in
the key and metadata distribution and management processes.

2.4    FCKMS Functions

An FCKMS provides key and metadata management functions for cryptographic-based
security in user applications, such as secure data communication and storage. These
functions include the generation, distribution and destruction of cryptographic keys and their
associated metadata (see Section 6.4).

2.5    CKMS Design

In accordance with the Framework, any CKMS design should describe how it provides
cryptographic keys to the entities that will use those keys to protect sensitive data. The
CKMS design documentation should specify the use of each key type, where and how keys
can be generated, how they can be protected in storage and during delivery, and the types of
entities to whom they can be delivered.

FR:2.3 A compliant CKMS design shall describe design selections and provide
documentation as required by the requirements of the Framework.

FR:2.4 The CKMS design shall specify a high-level overview of the CKMS system that
includes:
   a) The use of each key type,
   b) Where and how the keys are generated,
   c) The metadata elements that are used in a trusted association with each key type,
   d) How keys and/or metadata are protected in storage at each entity where they reside,

   e) How keys and/or metadata are protected during distribution, and
   f) The types of entities to which keys and/or metadata can be delivered (e.g., user, user
      device, network device).

                SC-12      A Federal CKMS shall support the availability and security

                           of its cryptographic keys and their associated metadata.

                           documentation and support all the specified services,
                           functions, and features of the design.
                SA-5       A Federal CKMS compliance document shall be created prior
PR:2.8
                           to the initial operation of an FCKMS, describing how each
                           Profile requirement is satisfied and how each implemented
                           augmentation and/or feature is satisfied.

2.6   CKMS Profile

A CKMS Profile provides the requirements that a qualifying CKMS, its implementation, and
its operation must meet for a particular sector of interest, such as the Federal government. A
CKMS Profile specifies how the CKMS must be designed, implemented, tested, evaluated,
and operated. A CKMS Profile is a set of requirements that must be satisfied for a given
impact-level by a CKMS as implemented in an operational system.

2.7   FCKMS Profile

This FCKMS Profile (i.e., [SP 800-152]) specifies requirements, augmentations, and features
for the U.S. Federal government that will allow a CKMS designer and implementer to create
an FCKMS that can be used to protect Federal government information.

2.8   Differences between the Framework and This Profile

In the Framework, this section discusses the differences between a Framework and a profile
of that Framework. Essentially, the Framework requires that specific topics be addressed
during the design of a CKMS and described in design documentation. Any CKMS complies
with the Framework if its design documentation satisfies all the Framework Requirements.
A profile states the specific requirements that must be met in order to have a satisfactory
CKMS for the designated using sector. This Profile (i.e., SP 800-152) imposes specific
design and implementation requirements on a CKMS that can be used as an FCKMS, and
provides additional requirements for testing, procurement, installation, configuration,
administration, operation, maintenance and use.

2.9   Example of a Distributed CKMS Supporting a Secure E-Mail Application

In the Framework, this section provides a useful example of a secure email application.

2.10 Modules, Devices, and Components

This Profile uses the term “component” to mean any hardware, software, and/or firmware
required to construct a CKMS. The term “device” denotes a combination of components that
function together to serve a specific purpose. An FCKMS module is a device that performs a
set of key and metadata management functions for at least one FCKMS.

As shown in Figure 1, an FCKMS includes one or more computers, each with an FCKMS
module that interacts with the FCKMS modules in other computers, often using a means of
communication that requires cryptographic protection. An FCKMS module is the hardware
and/or software that can interact with identical or compatible FCKMS modules located
wherever keys and their metadata are required. Each FCKMS module is associated with a
cryptographic module. A cryptographic module is the hardware and/or software that
performs the actual cryptographic operations, e.g., encryption, decryption and generating a
digital signature. Each FCKMS module must have access to a cryptographic module that
functions as a sub-module of the FCKMS module.




                     Figure 1: FCKMS and its FCKMS Modules

The cryptographic modules used in an FCKMS must be FIPS 140-validated at an appropriate
FIPS 140 security level for the impact-level associated with the information that the keys will
protect. A higher FIPS 140 security level than the minimum level is acceptable.

At a minimum, low impact data must be protected by employing a cryptographic module that
has been validated at level 2 or higher, or at security level 1 if the FCKMS provides either
identity-based or role based authentication and physical-security protection that compensates
for the level 2 physical-security requirements not included in the module. Accordingly, the
                                              11

higher impact-levels must use cryptographic modules that provide increasingly more
protection than is provided at the Low impact-level, i.e.. the Moderate impact-level requires a
level 3 cryptographic module or higher, and the High impact-level requires level 4 physical
security, with all other areas at security levels 3 or higher.

                           attacks.

3 Federal CKMS Goals
A Federal CKMS should achieve goals and satisfy requirements that are specified in the
security policies of one or more Federal organizations. The typical primary security goal of
an organization is to protect its information at a level commensurate with its value,
sensitivity, and perceived risks. Three information-system impact-levels are defined in [FIPS
200] and [FIPS 199]: Low, Moderate, and High. As discussed in Section 8.5, Federal
organizations are required to establish the appropriate impact-levels for the various
categories of information processed, stored, and transmitted within Federal information
systems, based on the potential adverse impact to organizational operations and assets, if
such information is lost or compromised. After the impact-level is determined, the
appropriate controls for an FCKMS may be selected from [SP 800-53] and this Profile (i.e.,
SP 800-152), and then assessed using [SP 800-53A].

3.1   Providing Key Management to Networks, Applications, and Users

The information-processing network in which an FCKMS operates is also typically used as
the communications backbone of both the user’s applications and the FCKMS. Network
characteristics, such as error properties, could influence the selection of the cryptographic
algorithms and cryptographic modes of operation, because some modes of operation extend
communication errors, which could make the decrypted communication unintelligible. Other
modes can minimize the effects of a communication error.

An FCKMS could provide key-management services for a single organization, application,
or user, or for many of each. An FCKMS designed for a single application could be
integrated into that application, while an FCKMS supporting many applications and/or users
in geographically distributed locations could be distributed to wherever key-management
services are needed and require communication networks to provide interaction between the
distributed applications and users.

FR:3.1 The CKMS design shall specify its goals with respect to the communications
networks on which it will function.

FR:3.2 The CKMS design shall specify the intended applications that it will support.

FR:3.3 The CKMS design shall list the intended number of users and the responsibilities that
the CKMS places on those users.

3.2   Maximize the Use of COTS Products in an FCKMS

Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that are designed and produced for many
customers are typically less costly to acquire, operate, and maintain than custom products
that have been designed for a single customer. A CKMS that satisfies a wide range of
requirements is often a goal of CKMS designers, FCKMS service providers and FCKMS
service-using organizations because of its reduced cost, wider market acceptance, and greater
interoperability among FCKMSs. A COTS CKMS could be configurable to meet the special
needs of multiple customers and, therefore, be widely accepted in the marketplace.

SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:3.4 The CKMS design shall specify the COTS products used in the CKMS.

FR:3.5 The CKMS design shall specify which security functions are performed by COTS
products.

FR:3.6 The CKMS design shall specify how COTS products are configured and augmented
to meet the CKMS goal.

3.3    Conformance to Standards

An FCKMS that conforms to widely accepted security standards often increases confidence
in its ability to provide the desired protection, since it benefits from the wisdom that went
into developing the standards. If the standards have validation programs that measure
compliance and those validations are obtained, there is increased confidence that the FCKMS
has implemented that standard correctly. The use of standards also fosters interoperability
when different FCKMSs need to interoperate.

FR:3.7 The CKMS design shall specify the Federal, national, and international standards
that are utilized by the CKMS.

FR:3.8 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify which
CKMS devices implement the standard.

FR:3.9 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify how
conformance to the standard was validated (e.g., by a third-party testing program).

                SC-13       A Federal CKMS shall specify the Federal Information
PR:3.1
                            Processing Standards (FIPS) and NIST Special Publications
                            (SPs) to which the FCKMS or FCKMS devices have been
                            validated.

                            A Federal CKMS could conform to selected specifications of
PF:3.1
                            Industrial, National, and International standards for security
                            and interoperability of the FCKMS.

3.4    Ease-of-use

Ease-of-use is very subjective. Something easy for one person to do may not be easy for
another. An FCKMS should be easy to use by both untrained and experienced users. For
example, the FCKMS could assist untrained users by performing the required actions
automatically, but provide an interface for experienced users to select and use acceptable
alternative actions. Negative user experiences could affect the acceptability and use of a
security service or product. A Federal CKMS should be designed to support a range of user
expertise and experience.

Ease-of-use testing is discussed in Section 9.8.


                                              14

3.4.1 Accommodate User Ability and Preferences
An FCKMS should accommodate differences in user abilities and preferences when
managing their keys and metadata. Differences generally include user knowledge,
experience, task familiarity, and motivation. Preferences often vary between user control and
system control.

An FCKMS could provide fully automated security services to a user or an application, based
on the organizational policy. It could provide a combination of automated security services
and those selected and controlled by a user or application. An FCKMS should support user
control, based on organizational policy and user desires, and provide one or more security-
service-control interfaces for its users and managers.

FR:3.10 The CKMS design shall specify all user interfaces to the system.

FR:3.11 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any user-acceptance tests that have
been performed regarding the ease of using the proposed user interfaces.

                           A Federal CKMS should support user interfaces that:
PA:3.1
                             a) Require minimal user interactions with the FCKMS,
                             b) Are commensurate with the range of experience and
                                capability of its expected users,
                             c) Support a user initiating the generation of cryptographic
                                keys and associated metadata, and
                             d) Provide one or more security-service-control interfaces.

                           A Federal CKMS could provide fully automated services to a
PF:3.2
                           user or an application, based on organizational policy.

3.4.2 Design Principles of the User Interface
Ease-of-use design goals should assure that:
   a) It is intuitive and easy to do the right thing,
   b) It is not easy to do the wrong thing, and
   c) It is intuitive and easy to recover when a wrong thing is done.
FR:3.12 The CKMS design shall specify the design principles of the user interface.

FR:3.13 The CKMS design shall specify all human error-prevention or failsafe features
designed into the system.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support features that are designed to
PR:3.2
                           detect and/or mitigate incorrect user input.


                           A Federal CKMS should support user interfaces (as needed)
PA:3.2
                           that assist the user in selecting and using appropriate security

                           functions and services for the key-management services that
                           they require.
                            A Federal CKMS should support control interfaces (as
PA:3.3
                           needed) that support the Federal CKMS roles and assure that:
                             a) It is intuitive to initiate and perform all supported key-
                                management service-control interactions with the
                                FCKMS (e.g., to select and invoke a key-management
                                function);
                             b) It is difficult to make an error or cause a security breach
                                when initiating or interacting with an FCKMS service;
                                and
                             c) It is easy to recover from an FCKMS service initiation
                                or control error.

                           A Federal CKMS could support the same interfaces as used
PF:3.3
                           by other Federal CKMSs.

3.5   Performance and Scalability

Performance and scalability should be considered when designing a CKMS. The
performance of an FCKMS will generally depend on factors that include 1) the simplicity of
the overall design, 2) the number and type of service-using organizations, 3) the sensitive
applications and number of users being supported, 4) the communications capabilities and
geographical distribution among the distributed devices of the FCKMS, and 5) the
capabilities of the computers, modules, and devices comprising it. The scalability of an
FCKMS depends on such factors as the flexibility of the underlying CKMS design and
implementation to support increasing service demands, and the ability to replace or upgrade
its devices and components as necessary.

FR:3.14 The CKMS design shall specify the performance characteristics of the CKMS,
including the average and peak workloads that can be handled for the types of functions and
transactions implemented, and the response times for the types of functions and transactions
under those respective workloads.

FR:3.15 The CKMS design shall specify the techniques that are supported and can be used
to scale the system to increased workload demands.

FR:3.16 The CKMS design shall specify the extent to which the CKMS can be scaled to
meet increased workload demands. This shall be expressed in terms of additional workload,
response times for the workload, and cost.

                           A Federal CKMS shall be scalable to support increasing
PR:3.3
                           numbers of FCKMS users and their computers,
                           communications, and sensitive applications.

                           A Federal CKMS-using organization shall identify the
PR:3.4
                           maximum required design capacity (e.g., the maximum
                           number of users, the number of FKCMS computers or mobile
                           devices, the communications bandwidth, and the applications
                           to be supported by its FCKMS and its associated
                           communication mechanisms).

3.6   Intellectual Property Rights

A goal of designing, implementing, and operating any system is to avoid complex and
expensive litigation. Intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademarks, and patents
should be respected as required by law. Therefore, it is best to identify and resolve possible
legal issues as soon as possible.

                           Federal CKS service-providing organizations should identify
PA:3.4
                           intellectual-property rights that apply to the design,
                           procurement, implementation, and operation of a new or
                           upgraded FCKMS.

4 Security Policies
An organization often creates and supports layered security policies, with high-level policies
addressing the management of its information and lower-level policies specifying the rules
for protecting the information.

An organization could have different policies covering different applications or categories of
information. For example, a Federal organization could have one set of policies covering its
financial information and a different set of policies covering its personnel information.

This section describes a layered set of policies, including an Information Management
Policy, an Information Security Policy, and an FCKMS Security Policy.

4.1   Information Management Policy

An organization’s Information Management Policy governs the collection, processing, and
use of an organization’s information, and should specify, at a high level, what information is
to be collected or created, and how it is to be managed. An organization’s management
establishes this policy using industry standards of good practices, legal requirements
regarding the organization’s information, and organizational goals that must be achieved
using the information that the organization will be collecting and creating.

These specifications are the foundation of an Information Security Policy (see Section 4.2)
and dictate the levels of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source-authentication
protections that must be provided for each category of sensitive and valuable information
covered by the Information Management Policy.

                           A Federal CKMS service-using organization shall create an
PR:4.1
                           Information Management Policy that:
                              a) Specifies the information to be collected or created and
                                 how it is to be managed;
                              b) Specifies the high-level goals for obtaining and using
                                 the information;
                              c) Specifies the organizational management roles and
                                 responsibilities for the policy and establishes the
                                 authorization required for people performing these
                                 information-management duties;
                              d) Specifies what categories of information need to be
                                 protected against unauthorized disclosure, modification
                                 or destruction; and
                              e) Establishes the rules for authorizing one or more people
                                 to create policy and manage its implementation and
                                 use.

4.2    Information Security Policy

An organization’s Information Security Policy is created to support and enforce portions of
the organization’s Information Management Policy by specifying in more detail what
information is to be protected from anticipated threats and how that protection is to be
attained. A Federal organization may have different Information Security Policies covering
different applications or categories of information (e.g., the policies may be different for non-
personnel information than for personnel information).

The Information Security Policy should be used to create an FCKMS Security Policy (see
Section 4.3).

                 PL-1        A Federal CKMS using-organization shall create an
PR:4.2
                 RA-2        Information Security Policy that is consistent with the
                             organization’s Information Management Policy and
                             specifies:
                               a) The categories of information that are considered
                                  sensitive;
                               b) The impact-level associated with the sensitive
                                  information;
                               c) The current, anticipated, and potential threats to the
                                  information;
                               d) How the necessary protection is to be obtained; and
                               e) The rules for collecting, protecting and distributing the
                                  sensitive information.

4.3    CKMS and FCKMS Security Policies

This Profile is based on the assumption that a CKMS designer will either build a product that
supports the specific policies of its known potential customers or one that is comprehensive
and flexible enough to be configured to satisfy different security policies for a large number
of future customers.

A CKMS designer creates a CKMS Security Policy to protect the cryptographic keys and
metadata used by the CKMS and to enforce restrictions associated with their use. The
protections should cover the entire key lifecycle, including when they are operational, stored,
and transported. A CKMS Security Policy includes an identification of all cryptographic
mechanisms and cryptographic protocols that can be used by the CKMS.

The FCKMS Security Policy of a security domain should be derived from the Information
Management policies of all organizations comprising the security domain. All entities that
constitute a security domain are responsible for being aware of and following the FCKMS
Security Policy. All entities in the domain are responsible for protecting the keys and
associated metadata used to cryptographically protect data in accordance with the FCKMS
Security Policy.

                         Figure 2: CKMS Security Policy Configurations

An FCKMS Security Policy is intended to support the Information Security Policy of the
FCKMS service-using organization(s) by specifying the rules for managing the cryptographic
keys and metadata used to protect the information. An FCKMS Security Policy may be a
configured subset of the designer’s CKMS Security Policy, which specifically meets Federal
government requirements and also the specific requirements of the service-using
organization(s). See Figure 2 for an example.

Figure 2 depicts a CKMS Security Policy (in the top-level box) with general features and
capabilities, as well as optional features/capabilities that can be selected or prohibited to
create a sub-policy appropriate for a specific CKMS service provider. The green text is used
to indicate features that are compliant with the United States Government (USG)
requirements of this document. Options A, C, and D (indicated in green text) are all approved
for USG use. However, Option B (indicated by red text) is not approved. For example,
Option B may involve the use of a cryptographic algorithm that is not approved for USG use.
The second-level boxes show three possible configurations that could be selected using the
CKMS options. Configuration 1 contains Options A, C, and D; Configuration 2 contains
Options A and B; and Configuration 3 contains only Option B. Configuration 1 can always
function as an FCKMS, since all its features and options are consistent with USG use.
Configuration 2 can function as an FCKMS when Option A is used, but it can function only
as a CKMS when Option B is used. Finally, Configuration 3 can never function as an
FCKMS, since the non-approved Option B is always used. Federal agencies could always
                                                    20

use Configuration 1. They could use Configuration 2 if only Option A was selected, but they
could never use Configuration 3 for sensitive U.S. Government data.

Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the organization that owns the data to assure that the
data is properly protected. That organization is often the FCKMS service-using organization.
An FCKMS service-using organization must use an FCKMS that supports a security policy
that is consistent with its higher-level policies (e.g., its Information Management Policy and
Information Security Policy) and other applicable U.S. Government requirements. A Federal
organization that is considering the procurement of a CKMS or the services of a CKMS
provider should review the security policy of each candidate CKMS and verify that the
CKMS has the necessary capabilities. An appropriate FCKMS Security Policy should then be
created. The FCKMS Security Policy should specify the rules that can assure the availability,
confidentiality, and integrity of the organization’s cryptographic keys and bound metadata
that will be used to protect the sensitive information to be protected by the FCKMS. An
FCKMS service-using organization should verify that its security policies are consistent with,
and can be supported by, an FCKMS service provider, both administratively and technically.

The FCKMS Security Policy should specify how to protect each type of key and its
associated metadata throughout their lifecycles, including when they are stored, transported,
or used.

An FCKMS service-using organization should assist in adopting, supporting, and enforcing
its own security policies and implementation rules by providing for tutorials to new managers
and users on how services should be managed and used. If a user can select and initiate
security services for an application or category of information, then the FCKMS service-
providing organization should assist in selecting appropriate security services by informing
the user of the rules and how the rules can and should be followed. The FCKMS should be
configured so as to minimize the likelihood that a user could select an inappropriate option.

FR:4.1 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS Security Policy, including the
configurable options and sub-policies that it is designed to enforce.

FR:4.2 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS Security Policy is to be enforced by
the CKMS (e.g., the mechanisms used to provide the protection required by the policy).

FR:4.3 The CKMS design shall specify how any automated portions of the CKMS Security
Policy are expressed in an unambiguous tabular form or a formal language (e.g., XML or
ASN.1), such that an automated security system (e.g., table driven or syntax-directed
software mechanisms) in the CKMS can enforce them.

                PL-1       A Federal CKMS shall make its FCKMS Security Policy
PR:4.5
                           available to all its FCKMS service-using organizations and

                           of the FCKMS in accordance with those policies.

                           The FCKMS Security Policy should specify the following:
PA:4.1
                            a) The names of the organization(s) adopting the policy;
                            b) Who (person, title or role) is authorized to
                               approve/modify the policy,
                            c) The impact-levels of the information that is specified in
                               and controlled by the policy,
                            d) The primary data and key/metadata protection services
                               (i.e., data confidentiality, data integrity, source
                               authentication) that are to be provided by the FCKMS,
                            e) The security services (e.g., personal accountability,
                               personal privacy, availability, anonymity, unlinkability,
                               unobservability) that can be supported by the FCKMS,
                            f) Sensitivity and handling restrictions for keys and
                               associated metadata,
                            g) The algorithms and all associated parameters to be used
                               for each impact-level and with each protection service,
                            h) The expected maximum lifetime of keys and metadata
                               for each cryptographic algorithm used,
                            i) The acceptable methods of user/role and source
                               authentication for each information impact-level to be
                               protected by a key and its associated metadata,
                            j) The backup, archiving and recovery requirements for
                               keys and metadata at each information impact-level,
                            k) The roles to be supported by the FCKMS,
                            l) The access control and physical security requirements
                               for the FCKMS’s keys and metadata for each impact-
                               level,
                            m) The means and rules for recovering keys and metadata,
                               and
                            n) The communication protocols to be used when
                               protecting sensitive data, keys, and metadata.

A security policy should be written so that the people responsible for managing and using the
policy can understand the goals of the policy and can follow its implementation rules. A
security policy could be encoded in an electronic form (e.g., a policy specification formal
language, table of security rules, or computer program) such that an FCKMS could
                                             22
SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


automatically support and enforce parts of the policy. Automated security policy support
systems could be programmed to detect security problems and resolve them in accordance
with the policy.

A Security policy can be described in a formal language that can be used to explicitly define
the syntax (i.e., acceptable sentences) of a policy such that a computer program can
recognize and follow the rules of the policy. These rules could be called the semantics (i.e.,
acceptable meaning) of each sentence of the language. If a security policy is encoded
correctly, a Federal CKMS could support and enforce it.

                           A Federal CKMS could support its administrators in
PF:4.1
                           assessing a security policy for completeness and
                           enforceability.

4.4   FCKMS Module Security Policy

As shown in Figure 1 of Section 2.10, an FCKMS consists of one or more computers
containing an FCKMS module, with an associated cryptographic module. The computer
could, in fact, have more than one FCKMS module and more than one cryptographic module.
Each FCKMS module is designed to support one or more FCKMSs, along with their FCKMS
Security Policies.

Each FCKMS module must have its own FCKMS Module Security Policy, which supports
one or more FCKMS Security Policies. However, the security policy for an FCKMS module
may not be a full FCKMS Security Policy. The FCKMS Module Security Policy need only
deal with the subset of the FCKMS Security Policy that applies to the module itself.

Figure 3 depicts an example of a network consisting of three Federal Entities and three
FCKMSs, each with its own FCKMS Security Policy as indicated by the colors red, blue, and
green. The arrowed lines between FCKMS modules indicate communications links over
which cryptographic keys and metadata may be established according to the policy indicated
by the color of the line. Thus, Federal Entity 1 can establish keys with Federal Entity 2 using
the blue FCKMS with the blue FCKMS Security Policy. Federal Entity 1 can also establish
keys with Federal Entity 3 using the red FCKMS with the red FCKMS Security Policy.
Finally, Federal Entity 1 could store keys that it uses only for its own purposes using the
green FCKMS with the green FCKMS Security Policy.

                             Figure 3: An FCKMS Network

Figure 3 shows that a module may function in different FCKMSs and support different
FCKMS Security Policies. For example, Federal Entity 1 has a module that can support
either a blue FCKMS Security Policy or a red FCKMS Security Policy. Such FCKMS
modules must be capable of maintaining the separation of the keys and metadata of each
FCKMS that it supports. Federal Entity 3 cannot exchange keys and metadata with Federal
Entity 2 or Federal Entity 4 unless the red and blue FCKMS Security Policies are determined
to be equivalent or compatible (see Section 4.11.3) by the red and blue system authorities.

                PL-1       An FCKMS module shall have an FCKMS Module Security
PR:4.7
                           Policy that identifies the subsets of all known FCKMS
                           Security Policies that it supports.
              AC-4 (22)    An FCKMS module that interacts with multiple non-
PR:4.8
                           equivalent and non-compatible FCKMSs shall support the
                           separation of keys and metadata of each FCKMS from each
                           other FCKMS.

4.5   Cryptographic Module Security Policy

A cryptographic module security policy is a statement of the rules that the cryptographic
module will follow when performing cryptographic functions (e.g., key generation and
signature verification). This policy specifies the mechanisms to be used to maintain the
                                             24
SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


security of the module and to protect sensitive data, including secret and private plaintext
keys and sensitive metadata. The cryptographic module security policy includes
specifications for controlling access to the keys and metadata, the physical security provided
to protect the module’s storage and processing capabilities, and the mitigation of other
attacks specified in the policy. See [FIPS 140] for further information.

4.6   Other Related Security Policies

An FCKMS Security Policy could include or rely on other security policies or provisions,
such as a Physical Security Policy, a Communications Security Policy, and/or a Computer
Security Policy. Organizations typically develop their own physical security policies, and
computer systems are often built to their own computer security policies. An organization
should organize these policies in a logical structure that assigns roles for managing and
enforcing the policies to appropriate parts of the organization.

FR:4.4 The CKMS design shall specify other related security policies that support the
CKMS Security Policy.

                           Federal CKMS service-using organizations should coordinate
PA:4.2
                           with their service-providing organization in defining and
                           supporting security policies for providing key-management
                           services for their users.
                           A Federal CKMS service provider should have a Computer
PA:4.3
                           Security Policy.
                           A Federal CKMS service-using organization should create a
PA:4.4
                           Computer Security Policy that identifies:
                               a) The information that is processed, communicated, and
                                  stored within its computer systems that requires
                                  protection,
                               b) The threats that are to be protected against, and
                               c) The detailed rules for protecting the information by
                                  computers, communication systems, and computer
                                  users.
                           A Federal CKMS should use and support applications using
PA:4.5
                           computer operating systems that provide security in
                           accordance with the FCKMS service-using organization’s
                           Computer Security Policy.

4.7   Interrelationships among Policies

The Information Management Policy, Information Security Policy, FCKMS Security Policy,
FCKMS Module Security Policy, Cryptographic Module Security Policy and other related
security policies typically form a top-down layered set of policies in which a lower-layer
policy supports the policy/policies at the higher layers. For example, an Information
Management Policy for protecting certain categories of information from unauthorized
                                             25
SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


disclosure may result in an Information Security Policy for encrypting data before being
transmitted or stored. This Policy may dictate an FCKMS Security Policy specifying the use
of symmetric-key encryption/decryption using a specific algorithm and key length. The
FCKMS Module Security Policy may specify the necessary key and metadata management
functions, and the Cryptographic Module Security Policy would describe how the keys
would be protected while in a Cryptographic Module.

FR:4.5 The CKMS design shall specify the policies that are supported by the CKMS design
and a summary of how they are supported by the design.

             PL-1           A Federal CKMS shall document the relationships among its
PR:4.9
                            policies.
                            The security policies of a Federal CKMS shall be compatible
PR:4.10
                            with each other.

4.8   Personal Accountability

A Personal Accountability Policy requires that every person who accesses sensitive
information be held accountable for his or her actions. Personal accountability may be a
requirement in an Information Management Policy that needs to be supported by specific
features in the FCKMS for the management of keys and metadata, such as an access control
system that requires users to authenticate their identity before access is granted to an FCKMS
capability.

An FCKMS that supports a Personal Accountability Policy needs to be able to correctly
identify each person accessing and using the FCKMS, determine who is authorized to access
controlled items, grant access only upon verification of the authorization, and detect and
report any attempts for unauthorized access.

FR:4.6 The CKMS design shall specify if and how personal accountability is supported by
the CKMS.

                            A Federal CKMS operating at the Moderate or High impact-
PR:4.11

4.9   Anonymity, Unlinkability, and Unobservability

An Information Security Policy could require that certain users or categories of users of a
secure information-processing system be assured of anonymity, unlinkability, and/or
unobservability.
   a) Anonymity assures that an entity cannot be associated with specific information or
      actions;
   b) Unlinkability assures that two or more events in an information processing system
      cannot be determined to be related; and

   c) Unobservability assures that an attacker is unable to identify or infer the existence of
      a transaction and the identities of the entities that initiate or participate in the
      transaction.
FR:4.7 The CKMS design shall specify the anonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability
policies that can be supported by the CKMS.

4.9.1 Anonymity
An FCKMS often requires information about the identity of entities participating in FCKMS
transactions (e.g., to determine the keys to be used); an entity assuming the audit role may
also require this information. However, an FCKMS could protect the anonymity of the
entities operating in the user role when viewed by entities assuming non-audit roles and
entities not involved in the transactions. Since personal accountability is required at the
Moderate and High impact-levels, anonymity can only be provided at the Low impact-level.

FR:4.8 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with anonymity protection.

FR:4.9 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction anonymity is achieved when
anonymity assurance is provided.

                           A Federal CKMS shall not provide anonymity for Moderate
PR:4.13
                           or High impact-level data.
                           When anonymity is provided, a Federal CKMS shall assure
PR:4.14
                           that a key owner’s true identity cannot be determined when
                           viewed by entities assuming non-audit roles and entities not
                           involved in the transactions.

4.9.2 Unlinkability
An FCKMS may need to link FCKMS transactions together, e.g., a transaction that requests
the generation of a key, and another that uses it; an entity assuming the audit role may also
require this information. However, an FCKMS could provide unlinkability protection of
FCKMS transactions such that entities cannot be linked to initiating or participating in an
FCKMS transaction when viewed from outside the FCKMS or by entities assuming non-
audit roles within the FCKMS that are not involved in those transactions.

FR:4.10 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with unlinkability protection.

FR:4.11 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unlinkability is achieved.

                           When unlinkability is required, a Federal CKMS shall assure
PR:4.15
                           that unauthorized entities within the system cannot link two
                           or more transactions with each other or with the participants
                           in the transactions.

4.9.3 Unobservability
An FCKMS could protect the existence of transactions and the identities of the entities that
initiate or participate in the transactions from being observed (i.e., monitored, recorded).

FR:4.12 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with unobservability protection.

FR:4.13 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unobservability is
achieved.

                           When unobservability is required, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:4.16
                           assure that any key-management transaction is not observable
                           by anyone except authorized entities.

4.10 Laws, Rules, and Regulations

The security policies of an organization should conform to the laws, rules, and regulations of
the locality, state, and nation(s) in which its FCKMS will be used. If an FCKMS is designed
for international use, then it should be flexible enough to conform to the restrictions of
multiple nations.

FR:4.14 The CKMS design shall specify the countries and/or regions of countries where it is
intended for use and any legal restrictions that the CKMS is intended to enforce.

                SC-1       A Federal CKMS shall comply with U.S. Federal laws, rules
PR:4.17
                           and regulations.


                           A Federal CKMS should comply with the rules and
PA:4.8
                           regulations of the countries in which it is operating and
                           providing key-management services.

                           A Federal CKMS could be configurable to comply with the
PF:4.2
                           policies of one or more national and international
                           organizations.

4.11 Security Domains

A security domain is a collection of entities that support the same FCKMS Security Policy
(see Section 4.3). When two mutually trusting entities are operating in the same security
domain, the entities can exchange keys and metadata while providing the protections that are
required by the FCKMS Security Policy.

Security domains can be useful when managing an organization’s users and computers that
can connect to users and computers in other organizations. If different entities are in the
same Security Domain, sharing information securely is relatively easy. If they are in different
Security Domains, then the sharing of information becomes difficult or even impossible.
                                            29
SP 800-152                                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


When two entities are in different security domains, they may not be able to provide
equivalent protection to the exchanged keys and metadata because they are operating in
different FCKMSs under different FCKMS Security Policies. However, there are
circumstances in which an entity in one domain can send keys and metadata to another entity
in a different domain, even though their policies are not identical.

Before information is shared between entities in two or more Security Domains, their
FCKMS Security Policies must be carefully examined before exchanging or combining their
information. The domain authorities for the domains intending to share information should
verify that the different FCKMS Security Policies provide acceptable protection for each
other’s data. Computers could verify the equivalence or compatibility of two or more
FCKMS Security Policies if they are encoded to enable such verification.

A security domain could be defined for a single information impact-level (e.g., Low) or
could be defined for multiple impact-levels (e.g., Low and Moderate). The computer systems
that are processing multiple levels of sensitive information must be designed, programmed,
and operated to separate and protect the processing of information at the different impact-
levels.

4.11.1 Conditions for Data Exchange
Both the entity intending to send sensitive data to another entity in a different domain, and
the intended receiving entity, should satisfy the following conditions:
    a) Have an acceptable means of sending and receiving the information (i.e., the
       communications channel with agreed-upon protocols),
    b) Have interoperable cryptographic capabilities (e.g., identical encryption/decryption
       algorithms that utilize identical key lengths),
    c) Have acceptable FCKMS Security Policies for exchanging information, and
    d) Trust each other to enforce their FCKMS Security Policies.
If two entities belong to the same security domain, it is likely that these conditions can be met.
If the entities do not belong to the same security domain, then these conditions are less likely
to be satisfied. See Section 4.9.2 of the Framework for additional information.

FR:4.15 The CKMS design shall specify design features that allow for the exchange of keys
and metadata with entities in other security domains that are considered to offer equivalent
but different security protections.

4.11.2 Assurance of Protection
Protection assurances within security domains include protecting a key and/or metadata from
unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized modification, as well as verifying the source and
destination of a key and/or metadata.




                                                30
SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:4.16 The CKMS design shall specify the source and destination authentication policies
that it enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing security
domains.

FR:4.17 The CKMS design shall specify the confidentiality and integrity policies that it
enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing security domains.

FR:4.18 The CKMS design shall specify what assurances it requires when communicating
with entities from other security domains.

4.11.3 Equivalence and Compatibility of FCKMS Security Policies
When entities in different security domains need to share or mix data, their respective
security policies must be equivalent or compatible.

Two security domains have equivalent FCKMS Security Policies if the authority responsible
for each security domain agrees to accept the other domain’s FCKMS Security Policy as
being equivalent to its own FCKMS Security Policy in terms of the security protections,
including the levels of protection provided. If it is determined that the policies of two
FCKMSs are equivalent, then an entity in one security domain may share data with an entity
in another equivalent domain.

Two security domains are compatible if they can exchange a key and its metadata without
changing the protection provided to the key and metadata and without violating (or altering)
either domain’s FCKMS Security Policy. For example, suppose that domain 1 allows domain
1 entities to bind keys and metadata using RSA-2048, and domain 2 allows domain 2 entities
to receive and verify the binding on keys with RSA-2048, but domain 1 does not permit
using RSA-2048 for verifying the binding on keys, and domain 2 does not permit using RSA-
2048 for binding keys. Clearly, their security policies are different and not equivalent, yet a
key may be sent from a domain 1 entity to a domain 2 entity because the two domains are
compatible for a transaction that sends a key from domain 1 to domain 2.

FR:4.19 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the review and verification
of another domain’s security before intra-domain communications are permitted.

FR:4.20 The CKMS design shall specify how it detects, prevents or warns an entity of the
possible security consequences of communicating with an entity in a security domain with
weaker policies.

                            A Federal CKMS could support the authorities from
PF:4.3
                            different security domains in reviewing each other’s FCKMS
                            Security Policies and verifying their equivalence or
                            compatibility.
              AC-4 (20)     A Federal CKMS could support key-management services
PF:4.4
                            for the sharing of sensitive data among two or more domains
                            whose FCKMS security policies have been verified as being
                            equivalent or compatible.

              AC-4 (20)     A Federal CKMS could support protocols that obtain an
PF:4.5
                            FCKMS Security Policy from a different security domain,
                            compare the obtained policy to the local FCKMS Security
                            Policy, and establish whether the obtained policy is
                            equivalent to or compatible with the local FCKMS Security
                            Policy.
                            The domain authorities of Federal CKMSs could negotiate
PF:4.6
                            and institute a common FCKMS Security Policy for
                            protecting the data of both domains using the following
                            actions:
                                a) Agree on the common FCKMS Security Policy,
                                b) Notify all entities of the planned FCKMS Security
                                   Policy change, and
                                c) Verify that each domain enforces the common
                                   FCKMS Security Policy.

4.11.4 Third-Party Sharing
When two domain authorities examine each other’s FCKMS Security Policy for equivalence
to or compatibility with their own FCKMS Security Policy, they should carefully examine
each other’s policies for sharing keys, metadata and other information with other third-party
entities. For example, if domain A shares keys with domain B, can domain B share the same
key and metadata with an equivalent domain C? See the Framework for further discussion.

4.11.5 Multi-level Security Domains
A security domain could contain information having more than one impact-level (e.g.,
Moderate and High). In this case, an FCKMS must support key management for protecting
the information at both impact-levels. For this multi-level situation, the security domain acts
much like two separate security domains because it must distinguish between the two levels
of protection. Each entity in the domain must ensure 1) that keys and/or metadata protected
by the higher-level policy are always provided with the higher level of protection, 2) that
keys and/or metadata protected by the lower-level policy cannot be confused with the higher-
level keys and/or metadata, and 3) that higher-level keys and/or metadata do not get confused
with lower-level keys and/or metadata. This typically involves a multi-level secure computer
operating system.

FR:4.21 The CKMS design shall specify whether or not it supports multi-level security
domains.

FR:4.22 The CKMS design shall specify each level of security domain that it supports.

FR:4.23 If multi-level security domains are supported, the CKMS design shall specify how
it maintains the separation of the keys and metadata belonging to each security level.

             AC-4 (20)    A multi-level Federal CKMS could support a transaction
PF:4.7
                          between an entity from one security domain and an entity
                          from another security domain by:
                             a) Determining if the two FCKMS Security Policies are
                                multi-level,
                             b) Determining if the two policies have an acceptable
                                intersection of the level of protection that can be
                                provided for the information to be exchanged, and
                             c) Supporting that level of protection.
                          A Federal CKMS could support one or more multi-level
PF:4.8
                          security domains.

4.11.6 Upgrading and Downgrading
Under certain conditions, a domain authority could decide that a key and/or metadata from an
entity in a lower-level security domain (a domain providing less protection) can be accepted
and protected at the higher level required by its own FCKMS Security Policy. This process is
called upgrading. Upgrading should only be done if the authority responsible for the higher-
level domain trusts the source and authenticity of the key and/or metadata to be provided
from the lower level. Likewise, the domain authority for a higher-level security domain
might need to pass a key and/or metadata to a lower-level security domain entity, requiring
the protection on the key and/or metadata to be downgraded. In this case, the domain
authority for the higher-level domain must be assured that the key and/or metadata being
passed down only require the lower level of security provided by the receiver’s lower-level
domain.

FR:4.24 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the upgrading or
downgrading of keys and metadata.

FR:4.25 The CKMS design shall specify how upgrading or downgrading capabilities are
restricted to the domain authority.

                          In a Federal CKMS, upgrading and downgrading shall be
PR:4.18
                          under the control of an authorized domain authority.
                          In a Federal CKMS, a key and its associated metadata shall
PR:4.19
                          only be upgraded if the authority responsible for the higher-
                          level domain trusts the source and authenticity of the key
                          and/or metadata to be provided from the lower level domain.
                          In a Federal CKMS, a key and its associated metadata shall
PR:4.20
                          only be downgraded if the domain authority for the higher-
                          level domain has determined that the key and/or metadata
                          being passed down only requires the lower level of security
                          provided by the lower-level domain.

4.11.7 Changing FCKMS Security Policies
It may be desirable to change an FCKMS Security Policy. Some FCKMSs could have been
designed so that their FCKMS Security Policies can be configured to permit changes. The
domain authority should approve any policy change before it is made. It is the responsibility
of the Domain Authority initiating the change to inform other affected Security Domain
Authorities (e.g., other domains that have been determined to be equivalent or compatible)
when such changes to a security policy are made.

FR:4.26 The CKMS design shall specify if and how its key and/or metadata management
functions may be configured to support differing FCKMS Security Policies and differing
applications.

FR:4.27 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it can support changes in its FCKMS
Security Policy by being reconfigured to accommodate communications with entities in
different security domains.

               SA-11       A Federal CKMS shall perform the following actions before
PR:4.21
                           a changed FCKMS Security Policy is put into effect:
                               a) Document the new FCKMS Security Policy;
                               b) Evaluate its potential security consequences;
                               c) Approve the changes for the modified security
                                  domain;
                               d) Approve and implement the required FCKMS

5 Roles and Responsibilities
An FCKMS could interface with humans who are performing specific management, user,
and/or operator roles. Each role should have specific requirements for a person that will be
authorized to perform it. Each person that is authorized to perform a role should be provided
access to a set of key and metadata management functions that will assist in carrying out the
responsibilities of the role. In order to be authorized to perform a role and its associated
functions, each entity must be authenticated; note that this is a requirement for all FCKMS
impact-levels. This requirement may be satisfied by identity-based authentication at all
impact-levels or role-based authentication at the Low impact-level. Also, note that role-based
authentication is a less restrictive requirement than personal accountability, which is
addressed in Section 4.8.

Examples of FCKMS roles include, but are not limited to, the following. A description of
each role is provided in the Framework.

   a) System Authority,
   b) System Administrator,
   c) Cryptographic Officer,
   d) Domain Authority,
   e) Key Custodian,
   f) Key Owner,
   g) CKMS User,
   h) Audit Administrator,
   i) Registration Agent,
   j) Key-Recovery Agent, and
   k) CKMS Operator.
Multiple individuals could be assigned to perform a role, and/or one person could be
authorized to perform multiple roles. The same individual should not perform certain roles
indefinitely. It is prudent to periodically (and perhaps randomly) rotate individuals among
different roles to minimize the likelihood of long-term abuses. All persons should be properly
trained for the roles that they are assigned to perform. Highly sensitive roles may require
multiple individuals to perform the role (e.g., multiparty control).

FR:5.1 The CKMS design shall specify each role employed by the CKMS, the
responsibilities of each role, and how entities are assigned to each role.

FR:5.2 The CKMS design shall specify the key and metadata management functions (see
Section 6.4) that can be used by entities fulfilling each role employed by the CKMS.

FR:5.3 The CKMS design shall specify which roles require role separation.

FR:5.4 The CKMS design shall specify how the role separation is maintained for the roles
that require role separation.

                AC-3        initiating one or more activities while performing a role, and
                AC-5        restrict the activities of the person performing the role to
                AC-6        those allowed by the specification of the role.

                            support identity-based authentication.

PA:5.2
                            CKMS should be rotated periodically.

6 Cryptographic Algorithms, Keys, and Metadata
6.1    Cryptographic Algorithms and Keys

Cryptographic algorithms and their keys can be categorized according to their properties and
uses. Algorithms and keys can be categorized as being symmetric (with secret keys) or
asymmetric (with key pairs, one being public and the other private). Keys can be static (i.e.,
long term) or ephemeral (i.e., typically used only for a single secure session or key
management transaction). Cryptographic algorithms can be used for signature generation,
signature verification, data integrity, entity identity verification, information encryption and
decryption, and random number generation (RNG). Each type of cryptographic algorithm
requires a type of key appropriate for that algorithm and its current application. Key uses
include signature, authentication, encryption/decryption, key wrapping, random number
generation (RNG), master key, key transport, key agreement, and authorization. General
requirements relating to cryptographic algorithms and key strengths have been addressed in
Section 2.1.

6.1.1 Key Types, Lengths and Strengths
The Framework provides a list of twenty-one key types (shown below in Table 1) and a short
description of each key type.

                                     Table 1: Key Types
                    Key Type

                    7) Symmetric Key Wrapping Key
                    8) Symmetric RNG Key

                    18) Public Ephemeral Key Agreement Key
                    19) Symmetric Authorization Key
                    20) Private Authorization Key
                    21) Public Authorization Key

FR:6.1 The CKMS design shall specify and define each key type used.

SP 800-152                                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                               A Federal CKMS shall support all the key types and lengths
PR:6.1
                               required by its FCKMS Security Policy.

6.1.2 Key Protections
All keys managed by an FCKMS require integrity protection. Secret and private keys also
require confidentiality protection. FIPS-validated cryptographic modules have been designed
to provide this protection when used in accordance with the associated security policy.
However, when outside a FIPS-validated cryptographic module, either physical or logical
protection is required for these keys. Cryptographic protection is one form of logical
protection.

                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS shall physically or logically protect all
PR:6.2
                 SC-11         cryptographic keys from unauthorized disclosure, use, and
                 SC-12         modification.
                 SC-28
                               A Federal CKMS shall support the protection of keys at the

                               same or a higher impact-level than the data to be protected by
                               the keys.
                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS used to protect Moderate or High impact-
PR:6.4
                 SC-11         level information shall cryptographically protect all keys
                 SC-12         against unauthorized disclosure and modification when outside
                 SC-28         a cryptographic module.

                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS used to protect Low impact-level
PA:6.1
                 SC-11         information should cryptographically protect all keys against
                 SC-12         unauthorized disclosure and modification when outside a
                 SC-28         cryptographic module.

6.1.3 Key Assurance
When cryptographic keys and domain parameters4 are stored or distributed, they may pass
through unprotected environments. In this case, specific assurances are required before the
key and/or domain parameters may be used to perform cryptographic operations. Assurance
of integrity is needed for all keys and metadata. Assurance of possession is needed for both
secret and private keys. Assurance of domain parameter validity is needed for certain public-
key algorithms. Assurance of validity is needed for symmetric keys and the key pairs of
public-key algorithms (which includes pairwise consistence). See [SP 800-89], [SP 800-56A]
and [SP 800-56B] for further discussion. Other assurances that may be needed include source
authenticity.




4
 Note that domain parameters used in conjunction with some public-key algorithms to generate key pairs, to
create digital signatures, or to establish keying material, should not be confused with security domains.

PR:6.8
                          CKMS shall support assuring a receiver of a transported key
                          that it came from an authenticated and authorized source.

                          For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:6.2
                          support assuring a receiver of a transported key that it came
                          from an authenticated and authorized source.

6.2   Key Metadata

Key metadata is defined as information associated with a particular key that is managed by
the FCKMS.

The CKMS designer should select the metadata that is appropriate for a trusted association
with a key, based upon a number of factors, including the key type, the key lifecycle states,
and the CKMS Security Policy.

6.2.1 Metadata Elements
The following are metadata elements that are described in the Framework and may be
explicitly recorded. The descriptions in the Framework should be carefully reviewed when
making decisions with regard to their applicability. The metadata elements are:

   a) Key label,
   b) Key identifier,
   c) Owner identifier,
   d) Key lifecycle state,
   e) Key format specifier,

a key should be correctly associated with a key and used whenever a key is stored, retrieved,
loaded into a cryptographic module, used to protect data (e.g., other keys), exchanged with
peer entities authorized to use the key, and when assuring that a key is correctly protected.

FR:6.2 For each key type used in the system, the CKMS design shall specify all metadata

                           elements for all cryptographic keys.

6.2.2 Required Key and Metadata Information
Each key type requires certain metadata information to be available when a key is used,
whether the information is explicitly recorded as metadata or is otherwise known by the
FCKMS.

FR:6.13 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify the following information
regarding keys and metadata elements:

   a) The key type.
   b) The crypto period (for static keys).
   c) The method of generation.
      i. The RNG used.
      ii. A key generation specification (e.g., [FIPS 186] for signature keys, [SP 800-56A]
           for Diffie-Hellman key establishment keys).
   d) For each metadata element, include
      i. The source of the metadata, and
      ii. How the metadata is vetted,
   e) The method of key establishment
      i. The key transport scheme (if used),
      ii. The key agreement scheme (if used), and
      iii. The protocol name (if a named protocol is used).
   f) The disclosure protections (e.g., key confidentiality, physical security).

   g) The modification protections (e.g., a MAC or a digital signature).
   h) The applications that may use the key (e.g., TLS, EFS, S/MIME, IPSec, PKINIT,
      SSH, etc.).
   i) The applications that are not permitted to use the key.
   j) The key assurances:
         i. Symmetric-key assurances (e.g., format checks):
             Who obtains the assurance,
             The circumstances under which it is obtained, and
             How the assurance is obtained.
       ii. Asymmetric-key assurances (e.g., assurance of possession and validity):
             Who obtains the assurances,
             The circumstances under which the assurance is obtained, and
             How the assurance is obtained.
      iii. Domain parameter validity checks:
             Who performs the validity check,
             The circumstances under which the checking is performed, and
             How the assurance of domain parameter validity was obtained.

FR:6.14 The CKMS design shall specify all syntax, semantics, and formats of all key types
and their metadata that will be created, stored, transmitted, processed, and otherwise
managed by the CKMS.

6.3    Key Lifecycle States and Transitions

A key may pass through several states between its generation and its destruction. For a
discussion of key states, see Section 7 of [SP 800-57 Part 1]. A CKMS designer will select
and define the key states and transitions that will be supported by the FCKMS.

FR:6.15 The CKMS design shall specify all the states that the CKMS keys can attain.

FR:6.16 The CKMS design shall specify all transitions between the CKMS key states and
the data (inputs and outputs) involved in making the transitions.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support at least the following key
PR:6.18
                           lifecycle states and protect transitions among them: active,
                           deactivated, and compromised.

                           A Federal CKMS should support the destroyed state.

                           A Federal CKMS could support the following key lifecycle

6.4   Key and Metadata Management Functions

In an FCKMS, an entity can initiate key and metadata management functions. The functions
themselves are performed entirely within an FCKMS module, which contains a
cryptographic module to perform the cryptographic functions used by the FCKMS module.
An Access Control System (ACS) (see Section 6.7.1) performs the authentication and
authorization of an entity initiating a function.

An FCKMS should provide for the creation, modification, replacement, and destruction of
keys and their metadata. Depending on the impact-level and key type, the input and/or output
could have integrity authentication, source authentication, and/or confidentiality services
applied to them.

A trusted channel is a protected communication link established between the cryptographic
module and a sender or receiver to securely communicate unprotected plaintext CSPs, keys,
and authentication data. A trusted channel protects its contents from unauthorized
modification and disclosure along the communication link (see [ISO19790]).

A trusted channel exhibits a verification capability that permits the operator or the module to
confirm that the trusted channel has been established. The trusted channel must use only
NIST-approved security functions (see [FIPS 140]) to establish the channel and transfer data.

In the following subsections, the use of "key" applies to a symmetric key and an asymmetric
key pair, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated.

Parameters for a cryptographic function should be verified during input to an FCKMS and a
cryptographic module by verifying the protections (e.g., integrity codes) that have been
placed on the parameters.

FR:6.17 The CKMS design shall specify the key and metadata management functions to be
implemented and supported.

FR:6.18 The CKMS design shall identify the integrity, confidentiality, and source
authentication services that are applied to each key and metadata management function
parameter implemented in the CKMS.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support all key and metadata
PR:6.19
                           management functions that are required by the FCKMS
                           Security Policy.

                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, all sensitive
PR:6.20
                           data shall be transferred by means of a trusted channel.

                           A Federal CKMS should support the following key and
PA:6.7
                           metadata management functions: generate a key, deactivate a
                           key, register an owner, revoke a key, associate a key with its
                           metadata, list key metadata, destroy a key and its metadata,
                           establish a key, validate a key, recover a key and its metadata,
                           and perform cryptographic functions using a key and its
                           metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS should support the following for all user
PA:6.8
                           requests for key-management services:
                              a) The authentication of the identity/role of the entity
                                  initiating the request, and
                               b) A verification of the requestor’s authorization for
                                  receiving the service.

                           For Low impact-level systems, all sensitive data should be
PA:6.9
                           transferred by means of a trusted channel.

6.4.1 Generate a Key
When an entity requires a key, and it is not automatically provided by an FCKMS, the entity
should request that a key be generated by the FCKMS. The entity may need to specify the
type of key and other necessary information (e.g., the name of the key-generation technique),
including some metadata that needs to be associated with the key when requesting this
function. The function may not return the newly generated key, but could, for example,
return a key identifier that points to the key and its associated metadata.

Key-generation techniques typically depend on the cryptographic algorithm that will be used
with the key and the use of a random number generator. Different algorithms use keys that
have differing specifications (e.g., lengths and formats). Key generation for an asymmetric
algorithm results in the generation of a key pair, rather than a single key, which is the case
for symmetric algorithms. NIST has approved several random number generators (see [SP
800-90A], [SP 800-90B], [SP 800-90C] and [SP 800-131A]) and specifications for key
generation (see [SP 800-133]).

The key-generation function could provide, or require the input of, metadata that is to be
associated with the generated key.

FR:6.19 The CKMS design shall specify the key generation methods to be used in the
CKMS for each type of key.

FR:6.20 The CKMS design shall specify the underlying random number generators that are
used to generate symmetric and private keys.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support and use NIST-approved
PR:6.21
                           methods for key generation.

SP 800-152                                                       A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                             A Federal CKMS shall generate keys using a NIST-approved
PR:6.22
                             random number generator that provides a security strength
                             that meets or exceeds the security strength required for the
                             key.

6.4.2 Register an Owner
The initial registration of a security entity (i.e., an individual (person), organization, device or
process) and a cryptographic key with metadata is a fundamental requirement of every
FCKMS. This requirement is difficult to fully automate while preserving security (i.e.,
protecting from an impersonation threat), and thus, it usually requires verified and authorized
human interactions. There typically exists a registration process in an FCKMS that associates
each entity’s initial set of long-term (i.e., static) secret, public, and/or private keys with the
entity’s identifier and perhaps other metadata. The process of associating a key-owner’s
identifier, key, and metadata involves either an initial identity-based authentication by a
human relying on specific identification information, or relying on the pre-existing identity
of the owner in some FCKMS.

FR:6.21 The CKMS design shall specify all the processes involved in owner registration,
including the process for binding keys with the owner’s identifier.

                 IA-4        A Federal CKMS shall:
PR:6.23
                               a) Support the initial registration and periodic verification
                                  of each security entity that is to be managed,
                               b) Manage the association of each security entity with its
                                  key and its associated metadata, and
                               c) Provide owner registration and key association
                                  processes that can be implemented and evaluated for all
                                  FCKMS entities.
                 IA-4        During a registration process, a Federal CKMS shall register
PR:6.24
                             a security entity, as well as the entity’s initial cryptographic
                             keys and metadata.

6.4.3 Activate a Key
The activation function provides for the transition of a cryptographic key from the pre-
activation state to the active state (see [SP 800-57 Part 1] for further information). A key
could be automatically activated immediately after generation, upon request, or in
accordance with a date-time metadata value (e.g., set at the time of key generation) that
indicates when the key needs to become active and can be used.

FR:6.22 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is activated and the
circumstances for activating the key.

FR:6.23 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for the notification
of key activation, including which parties are notified, how they are notified, what security
services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for notification(s).
                                                47
SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.4.4 Deactivate a Key
This function transitions a key from an active state to a deactive state (see [SP 800-57 Part 1]
for further information). A cryptographic key is generally given a deactivation date and time
when it is created and distributed. Deactivation may also be based on the number of times a
key has been used to apply cryptographic protection or the amount of data that it has been
used to protect. This period usually has a maximum value, based in part on the impact-levels
of the data that the key is protecting and the threats that could be brought against that key or
the entire FCKMS.

FR:6.24 The CKMS design shall specify, for each key type, how deactivation of the key is
determined (e.g., by crypto period, by number of uses, or by the amount of data).

FR:6.25 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is deactivated (e.g., manually or
automatically, based on the deactivation date-time, the number of usages, or the amount of
protected data).

FR:6.26 The CKMS design shall specify how the deactivation date-time for each key type
can be changed.

FR:6.27 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the deactivation of the key type, including which CKMS supported roles are
notified, how they are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the
time-frames for notification(s).

                            A Federal CKMS shall support deactivating an active
PR:6.25
                            symmetric or private key and notifying relying parties that the
                            key has been deactivated.

6.4.5 Revoke a Key
When a key is to be removed from service, it may be revoked. Key revocation should be used
when the authorized use of a key must be terminated prior to the end of its cryptoperiod. A
cryptographic key should be revoked as soon as feasible after its use is no longer authorized
(e.g., the key has been compromised). Entities that have been, are, or will be using the key
(i.e., relying parties) need to be notified that the key has been revoked. Such notification is
accomplished by sending the notification to all relying parties and/or providing a notification
that can be accessed by the relying parties, when needed. In this publication, revocation
applies to both symmetric and asymmetric keys.

FR:6.28 The CKMS design shall specify when, how, and under what circumstances
revocation is performed and revocation information is made available to the relying parties.

                            A Federal CKMS shall support the revocation of a key and
PR:6.26
                            maintaining the reason for revocation.
                            A Federal CKMS shall provide a notification when a key is
PR:6.27
                            revoked, including the reason for the revocation.

6.4.6 Suspend and Re-Activate a Key
A key may be temporarily suspended and later re-activated, i.e., suspension is a temporary
revocation of the key. While revocation is generally irreversible, suspension can be reversed.
Entities that may be using or relying on a key must be notified of both the suspension and the
re-activation of the key.

Situations that may warrant suspension of a key, rather than irreversible revocation, include:
the unavailability of the owner for an extended period of time, a misuse of the key, a possible
compromise that is under investigation, and the misplacement of a token containing the key.

FR:6.29 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a key can be
suspended.

FR:6.30 The CKMS design shall specify how suspension information is made available to
the relying or communicating parties.

FR:6.31 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a suspended
key is re-activated.

FR:6.32 The CKMS design shall specify how the suspended key is prevented from
performing security services.

FR:6.33 The CKMS design shall specify how re-activation information is made available to
the relying or communicating parties.

                          When a key is suspended, a Federal CKMS shall provide a
PR:6.28
                          notification to all relying parties, including the reason for the
                          suspension.
                          When a key is re-activated after a suspension, a Federal
PR:6.29
                          CKMS shall provide a notification to all relying parties.


                          A Federal CKMS could be capable of suspending and
PF:6.2
                          reactivating a key.

6.4.7 Renew a Public Key Certificate
Public key certificates contain the public key of an asymmetric key pair and a validity period
for that certificate. Renewal establishes a new validity period by issuing a new certificate
containing the same public key, but a new validity period.

The public key in a certificate corresponds to a private key (which is kept secret). One key of
the key pair is used to apply cryptographic protection (e.g., to generate a digital signature),
and the other key is used to process the protected information (e.g., to verify a digital
signature). Each key of the key pair has its own cryptoperiod. The cryptoperiod of a key used
to apply protection can be considered as being the "originator usage period," and the
cryptoperiod of a key used to process the protected information can be considered to be the

                                              49
SP 800-152                                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


"recipient usage period." The validity period in a certificate applies to the key that is used to
apply protection, and must not exceed the key's originator usage period.

Several algorithms have been approved that use key pairs, and the role of each key of the key
pair is not necessarily the same. See [SP 800-57 Part 1] for more information.

        For digital signature key pairs, the private key is used to generate the signature (i.e.,
         apply protection), so it would have an originator usage period; the public key is used
         to verify the signature (i.e., process the protected information), so it would have a
         recipient usage period. The validity period in a certificate pertains to the use of the
         private key.
        For key transport keys, the public key is used to apply protection (i.e., encrypt), so its
         cryptoperiod would be considered as an originator usage period, while the private key
         is used to decrypt, so it's cryptoperiod would be considered as the recipient usage
         period. In this case, the originator usage period pertains to the use of the public key.
        For key agreement algorithms, the cryptoperiods of the two keys of the key pair are
         usually the same.

The sum of the validity periods for the original certificate and all renewed certificates for the
same key must not exceed the cryptoperiod of the key used to apply protection (i.e., the key
with the originator usage period).

An FCKMS could notify the owner of a certificate when a certificate is about to expire so
that the certificate could be renewed prior to the end validity date on the certificate.

FR:6.34 The CKMS design shall specify how and the conditions under which a public key
can be renewed.

notification of the key type renewal, including which parties are notified, how they are
notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).

                            A Federal CKMS shall not renew the validity period of a

6.4.8 Key Derivation or Key Update
When a key is derived from other information (some of which is secret) in a non-reversible
manner, the process is called key derivation. Key update is a special case of key derivation in
which the secret information includes a symmetric key (K1), and the derived symmetric key
(K2) replaces K1 for the next key-update process. Key updating could result in a security
exposure if an adversary obtains a key and knows the update process used. Key update is not
supported in this Profile.

FR:6.36 The CKMS design shall specify all processes used to derive or update keys and the
circumstances under which the keys are derived or updated.

FR:6.37 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification for deriving or updating the keys, including which parties are notified, how they
are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).

                           A Federal CKMS shall not support key update.
PR:6.31

                           A Federal CKMS shall use only NIST-approved or allowed
PR:6.32
                           key derivation methods.

6.4.9 Destroy a Key and Metadata
When a key and its sensitive metadata are no longer to be used for normal operations, then all
copies residing in operational storage (including within a cryptographic module) and in
backup storage should be destroyed as soon as possible. Keys and sensitive metadata in an
archive should be destroyed when no longer needed. Non-sensitive metadata may be
retained for administrative purposes.

This Profile considers this function to be a local function, destroying only locally stored keys
upon request. Destroying keys in remote locations may require special messages that request
a key's destruction.

FR:6.38 The CKMS design shall specify how and the circumstances under which keys are
intentionally destroyed and whether the destruction is local or universal throughout the
CKMS.

FR:6.39 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for an advance
notification of key destruction, including which parties are notified, how they are notified,
what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for notification(s).

                           When a key and/or its sensitive metadata are no longer to be
PR:6.33
                           used, a Federal CKMS shall destroy all local copies of the key
                           and/or its sensitive metadata.

PR:6.36
                           shall employ an approved metadata destruction method.

6.4.10 Associate a Key with its Metadata
A cryptographic key could have several metadata elements associated with it. The CKMS
designer determines which metadata are to be associated with a key and selects the protection
mechanism(s) that provide(s) the association. Depending on the sensitivity of a metadata
element, the metadata element could require confidentiality protection, integrity protection,
and source authentication. The association function uses cryptography or a trusted process to
provide these protections.

FR:6.40 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall specify what metadata is associated
with the key, how the metadata is associated with the key, and the circumstances under
which metadata is associated with the key.

FR:6.41 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall describe how the following security
services (protections) are applied to the associated metadata: source authentication, integrity,
and confidentiality.

                           A Federal CKMS shall:
PR:6.37
                               a) Create a trusted association between a key and its
                                  metadata upon their entry into the FCKMS,
                               b) Maintain the trusted association throughout the key’s
                                  lifetime, and
                               c) Establish a new trusted association following
                                  modification or replacement of any metadata.

                           A Federal CKMS that protects Moderate or High impact-level
PR:6.38
                           information shall cryptographically bind a key and its
                           metadata elements.

                           A Federal CKMS that protects Low impact-level information
PA:6.10
                           should cryptographically bind a key and its metadata
                           elements.

6.4.11 Modify Metadata
The modify metadata function can be used to modify existing metadata that is associated
with a key. Some metadata elements for a key type may be fixed after creation and not
                                              52

modifiable; other metadata elements may by modified by some entities, but not by others.
Attempted unauthorized modification of metadata that are associated with a key must be
detected, prevented, and should be reported.

FR:6.42 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which associated metadata
is modified.

                           A Federal CKMS shall designate which metadata elements are
PR:6.39
                           modifiable by authorized entities and which metadata elements
                           cannot be modified after initial creation.
                AC-3       A Federal CKMS shall prevent the modification of metadata
PR:6.40
                           except by authorized entities.


                           A Federal CKMS should report the attempted modification of
PA:6.11
                           metadata by unauthorized entities to the system administrator.

6.4.12 Delete Metadata
This function deletes metadata associated with a key. A deletion of the metadata requires the
authentication of the requestor and verification of his/her authorization. Metadata elements
may be deleted as an entire group, as an individual element, or as a specific subset of the
elements.

FR:6.43 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which the metadata
associated with a key is deleted.

FR:6.44 The CKMS design shall specify the technique used to delete associated metadata.

                AC-3       A Federal CKMS shall allow metadata destruction only by
PR:6.41
                           authenticated and authorized entities.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support the selection of metadata
PR:6.42
                           elements to be destroyed and the designation of who is
                           authorized to perform the destruction.

6.4.13 List Key Metadata
This function allows an authorized entity to list one or more metadata elements of a key. The
authorization of an entity to use a key does not automatically authorize that entity to list the
key’s metadata elements. Each metadata element could be assigned with a different set of
permissions (e.g., some metadata elements could be prohibited from being listed at all),
others could be listed by any user, while still others could be listed by only persons assuming
a particular role (e.g., an administrator or auditor).

FR:6.45 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata can be listed by
authorized entities.

                           A Federal CKMS shall provide metadata elements only to
PR:6.43
                           those entities authenticated and authorized for access to them.

6.4.14 Store Operational Key and Metadata Outside a Cryptographic Module
This function involves placing a key and/or metadata in storage outside of a cryptographic
module for use during the key’s cryptoperiod without retaining the original copy in the
cryptographic module (as opposed to a copy function, where the key resides in two
locations). Keys and metadata must be physically or cryptographically protected when stored
outside a cryptographic module (see the requirements specified in Section 6.1.2, Section
6.2.1, and [SP 800-57 Part 1]).

FR:6.46 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify: the circumstances under which
keys of each type and their metadata are stored, where the keys and metadata are stored, and
how the keys and metadata are protected.

6.4.15 Backup of a Key and its Metadata
The backup of keys and metadata involves copying the keys and/or metadata to a separate
medium than is used for the operational storage of keys and from which the keys can be
recovered if the original (operational) copy is lost, modified, or otherwise becomes
unavailable. The FCKMS, the owner, or a trusted entity could back up keys and metadata.

FR:6.47 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
keys and their metadata are backed up.

FR:6.48 The CKMS design shall specify the security policy for the protection of backed-up
keys/metadata.

FR:6.49 The CKMS design shall specify how the security policy is implemented during the
key and metadata back up, e.g., how the confidentiality and multiparty control requirements
are implemented during transport and storage of the backed-up keys and metadata.

                 CP-6      When keys and metadata are backed up, a medium that is
PR:6.44
                 CP-9      separate from that used for the operational storage of the keys
                           and metadata shall be used.
                SC-28      A Federal CKMS shall provide backed up keys and metadata
PR:6.45
                           with the same integrity and confidentiality protections as the
                           operational copies of the keys and metadata and at the same
                           or higher security strength.

6.4.16 Archive Key and/or Metadata
Key and/or metadata archiving involves placing a copy of a key and/or metadata in a safe
storage facility so that they can be recovered if and when needed. Key and/or metadata
archiving includes provisions for moving the key and/or metadata to a new storage medium
before the old medium is replaced or becomes unreadable.

An archive should support the FCKMS Security Policy (see Section 4.3) in archive facilities
and when moving keys and metadata to and from an archive. Archived keys and/or metadata
must be physically or cryptographically protected. Keys used to protect archived keys and/or
metadata will have cryptoperiods, and must be replaced when their cryptoperiods expire.
Changing an archive key may involve changing to a stronger cryptographic algorithm and
archive key, and re-encryption of the archived keys and/or metadata under the new archive
key and algorithm.

Maintaining a key and metadata archive could require moving archived keys and/or metadata
to new storage media when the old media are no longer readable because of the aging of, or
technical changes to, the media and media readers. When the archived keys and/or metadata
have been transferred to a new storage medium, the copies on the old storage medium must
be destroyed (see [SP 800-88]).

FR:6.50 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
keys and/or their metadata are archived.

FR:6.51 The CKMS design shall specify the technique for the secure destruction of the key
and/or metadata or the secure destruction of the old storage medium after being written onto
a new storage medium.

FR:6.52 The CKMS design shall specify how keys and/or their metadata are protected after
the cryptoperiod of an archive key expires.

               SC-28       When keys and metadata are archived, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.46
                           provide them with the same integrity and confidentiality
                           protections as the operational copies of the keys and metadata
                           and at the same, or a higher, security strength.
                SI-12      When keys and metadata are archived, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.47
                           archive keys and metadata in accordance with applicable
                           laws, regulations, and policies.
                           When archived keys and metadata are moved to a new
PR:6.48
                           medium, a Federal CKMS shall destroy the copies of keys
                           and metadata on the old storage medium using approved
                           methods.

                           A Federal CKMS should archive long-term keys and

                           medium is replaced or becomes unreadable.

6.4.17 Recover a Key and/or Metadata
Key and/or metadata recovery involves obtaining a copy of a key and/or its metadata that has
been previously backed up or archived. The key and/or metadata must be recovered by an

                          FCKMS rules for recovery.

6.4.18 Establish a Key
Key establishment is the process by which a key is securely shared between two or more
entities. The key may be transported from one entity to another (key transport), or the key
may be derived from a shared secret generated by the entities (key agreement). The method
of transporting or sharing keys may be either manual (e.g., sent by a courier) or automated
(e.g., sent over the Internet).

FR:6.57 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys and
their metadata are established.

6.4.19 Enter a Key and Associated Metadata into a Cryptographic Module
The key-entry function of a cryptographic module is used to enter one or more keys and
associated metadata into the module in preparation for use by the module. Section 2.10 above
requires the use of FIPS-140-validated cryptographic modules and relates the impact-levels
of data requiring protection to the [FIPS 140] security levels.

FR:6.58 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys and
metadata are entered into a cryptographic module, the form in which they are entered, and
the method used for entry.

                          the sending and receiving entities.

6.4.20 Output a Key and Associated Metadata from a Cryptographic Module
The key-output function of a cryptographic module outputs one or more keys and their
associated metadata from the module. The output of keys and metadata could be needed in
order to store (outside the cryptographic module), transfer, back up, or archive them. A
cryptographic module that serves as a key-generation facility for other FCKMS modules
would output keys prior to distribution.

As with key entry, a trusted channel is either required or recommended for key and sensitive
data output, depending on the impact-level of the system.

                                 A Federal CKMS shall validate public keys as specified in

6.4.23 Validate a Public Key Certification Path
This function validates the certification path (also known as a certificate chain) from the
relying entity's trust anchor5 to a public key in which the relying entity needs to establish
trust (i.e., the public key of the other entity in a transaction). Validation of the certification
path provides assurance that the identity of the originating entity, as specified in the
certificate, is the owner of the public key in the certificate and is the holder of the
corresponding private key. The latter assumes that a trusted certificate authority obtained
proof of private-key possession.

FR:6.65 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which, a
key certification path is validated.

                  IA-5 (2)       A Federal CKMS shall validate the certification path of a

                                 certificate.

  Technically, a trust anchor is a CA with a trusted certificate containing the CA's public key. However, the term
is also commonly used to refer to that certificate, which is usually cached locally in a trust-anchor store. In this
document, the term refers to a certificate.

6.4.24 Validate a Symmetric Key
This function performs a validity check on a symmetric key, e.g., to verify that the length and
format are correct. The function could also verify any error detection/correction codes or
integrity checks placed upon the key and/or its metadata.

FR:6.66 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
symmetric keys and/or metadata are validated.

                           A Federal CKMS shall validate a symmetric key before its
PR:6.59
                           initial use.

6.4.25 Validate Possession of a Symmetric Key
This function is used by an entity who receives an encrypted symmetric key and who needs
assurance that the claimed sender of the key has possession of the plaintext key. This
assurance may be obtained by encapsulating the plaintext key in a key package that has
sufficient redundancy known by the receiver. The receiver verifies the redundancy after
decryption. Alternatively, the sender and receiver may undergo a handshake that provides
assurance that the sender possesses the correct key.

                           A Federal CKMS shall obtain assurance of symmetric key
PR:6.60
                           possession by the sender of a symmetric key.

6.4.26 Validate a Private Key (or Key Pair)
This function performs tests on private keys or key pairs to verify that they meet their
specifications. Only the private-key owner or a trusted third party acting on behalf of the
private-key owner can perform this test.

6.4.28 Perform a Cryptographic Function using the Key
Cryptographic functions using keys are performed in a cryptographic module to
cryptographically protect data, including metadata and other keys, and process already-
protected information. These functions may include signature generation, signature
verification, data encryption, ciphertext decryption, key wrapping, key unwrapping, MAC
generation, and MAC verification.

FR:6.69 The CKMS design shall specify all cryptographic functions that are supported and
where they are performed in the CKMS (e.g., CA, host, or end user system).

6.4.29 Manage the Trust Anchor Store
An FCKMS could require that some entities have one or more trusted public keys, called
“trust anchors6.” Trust anchors are cached in a trust anchor store. A trust anchor can be used
to establish trust in other public keys that might not otherwise be trusted. Therefore, the
integrity of trust anchors is critical to the security of the FCKMS. The FCKMS typically
supports trust-anchor management functions, such as adding, deleting and storing trust
anchors.

Many commonly used products, such as browsers, are delivered and initially installed with
an assortment of trust anchors, not all of which merit trust.

FR:6.70 The CKMS design shall specify all trust anchor management functions that are
supported (see RFC 6024).

FR:6.71 The CKMS design shall specify how the trust anchors are securely distributed so
that the relying parties can perform source authentication and integrity verification on those
trust anchors.

FR:6.72 The CKMS design shall specify how the trust anchors are managed in relying-entity
systems to ensure that only authorized additions, modifications, and deletions are made to the
relying-entity system’s trust anchor store.

                   SC-12             A Federal CKMS shall only use trust anchors that meet the
PR:6.63

                                         a) The organization associated with the trust anchor is
                                            trusted,
                                         b) The security policy associated with the trust anchor is
                                            acceptable,
                                         c) The actual source of the trust anchor has been
                                            authenticated, and
                                         d) The integrity of the trust anchor has been verified.

                                     Only authorized additions, modifications, and deletions shall

6.5   Cryptographic Key and/or Metadata Security: In Storage

Cryptographic keys are typically stored with their metadata. An FCKMS should verify the
authorization of the submitting entity and the integrity of the submitted key and metadata
before they are stored. For Moderate and High impact-level systems, identity-based
authentication is required, and for Low impact-level systems either identity-based or role
based authentication is required. See Section 6.5 of the Framework for further discussion.

An FCKMS must only allow authorized users to have access to stored keys. Thus, an Access
Control System (ACS) (see Section 6.7.1) should protect stored keys and metadata.

FR:6.73 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to authenticate the identity and
verify the authorization of the entity submitting keys and/or metadata for storage.

6.6    Cryptographic Key and Metadata Security: During Key Establishment

Keys and metadata can be established between entities needing to communicate securely
using key transport or key agreement methods. These methods are typically used to establish
keys over electronic communications networks, but some of these could also be used to
provide extra security (i.e., beyond physical protection) when keys are manually distributed.
[SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify cryptographic schemes for automated key
establishment. PR:2.2 in Section 2.2 requires the use of NIST-approved key-establishment
schemes for automated key establishment.

6.6.1 Key Transport
When symmetric or private cryptographic keys and sensitive metadata are transported
(distributed) from one entity (the sender) to one or more other entities (the intended
receiver(s)), they must be protected. Symmetric keys and private keys require confidentiality
protection, and all keys require integrity protection. A trusted courier can physically protect a
manually transported key, while automated electronic-based transport must be protected
using cryptography. NIST-approved methods for automated key transport are provided in [SP
800-56A] and [SP 800-56B].

The receiver of a transported key typically needs assurance that the key came from the
expected, authorized key sender. When transported using automated methods, this assurance
may be provided by a cryptographic mechanism (which is part of the complete key-
establishment protocol) that authenticates the identity of the sender to the receiver; the
FCKMS should verify the sender’s authority to perform the transport. When a key is
transported manually, authenticating the identity of the courier, and verifying the courier’s
authorization to transport the key should be used to provide this assurance.

FR:6.80 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the confidentiality of
symmetric and private keys during their transport.

FR:6.81 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the integrity of
transported keys and how the keys can be reconstructed or replaced after detecting errors.

FR:6.82 The CKMS design shall specify how the identity of the key sender is authenticated
to the receiver of transported keying material.

                            When keys and metadata are received using a key-transport
PR:6.69
                            scheme, a Federal CKMS shall support mechanisms to verify:
                                a) The authorization of the source,
                                b) The integrity of the received data, and
                                               62

                              c) That confidentiality has been provided to secret and
                                 private keys and sensitive metadata.


6.6.2 Key Agreement
Two entities working together can create and agree on a cryptographic key without the key
being transported from one entity to the other during an automated key-agreement process.
Cryptographic algorithms employing key-agreement keys are used by each entity. NIST-
approved methods for key agreement using public-key algorithms are provided in [SP 800-
56A] and [SP 800-56B].

Each entity participating in a key-agreement process must obtain assurance of the identity of
the other entity during the execution of that process.

FR:6.83 The CKMS design shall specify each key agreement scheme supported by the
CKMS.

FR:6.84 The CKMS design shall specify how each entity participating in a key agreement is
authenticated.

                           When keys and metadata are agreed-upon during an
PR:6.70
                           automated key-agreement process in a Federal CKMS, each
                           entity involved in the transaction shall obtain assurance of the
                           identity or role of the other party.

6.6.3 Key Confirmation
When keys are established between two entities, each entity should confirm that the other
entity did, in fact, have the correct key. [SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify key
confirmation schemes for use in some automated key-establishment schemes. Other methods
may also be appropriate, such as decrypting ciphertext and comparing with the expected
plaintext value.

FR:6.85 The CKMS design shall specify each key confirmation method used to confirm that
the correct key was established with the other entity.

FR:6.86 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which each key
confirmation is performed.

                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal

                           CKMS shall support key confirmation for all key-
                           establishment transactions.

                           For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:6.17
                           support key confirmation for all key-establishment
                           transactions.

6.6.4 Key-Establishment Protocols
Several protocols have been developed for the establishment of cryptographic keys. Often,
these protocols are designed for a particular application or set of applications (e.g., secure
email or secure data file transfer).

A high-level overview of several key-establishment protocols can be found in [SP 800-57
Part 3], along with guidance as to which cryptographic options are recommended for U.S.
Government use. In this document (i.e., SP 800-152), these protocols are referred to as NIST-
allowed key-establishment protocols.

FR:6.87 The CKMS design shall specify all the protocols that are employed by the CKMS
for key establishment and storage purposes.

                            When key establishment is required, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.72
                            use a NIST-allowed key-establishment protocol.

6.7    Restricting Access to Key and Metadata Management Functions

Access to an FCKMS’s key and metadata management functions should be supported for
authorized entities and controlled to prevent unauthorized access to keys and metadata. An
entity requesting an FCKMS service or initiating a cryptographic function should be
authenticated, and that entity’s authorization should be verified (see the Section 5
requirements).

6.7.1 The Access Control System (ACS)
An access control system is needed by an FCKMS to assure that every key and metadata
management function can only be initiated by the FCKMS itself or in response to a request
by an authorized entity. When key-management functions are initiated by an entity, an access
control system must assure that the initiator is authenticated (i.e., by means of identity-based
authentication or role-based authentication), performing only the requested functions that are
authorized, and that all applicable constraints are satisfied. See Section 6.7.1 of the
Framework for additional discussion.

FR:6.88 The CKMS design shall specify the topology of the CKMS by indicating the
locations of the entities, the ACS, the function logic, and the connections between them.

FR:6.89 The CKMS design shall specify the constraints on the key management functions
that are implemented to assure proper operation.

FR:6.90 The CKMS design shall specify how access to the key management functions is
restricted to authorized entities.

FR:6.91 The CKMS design shall specify the ACS and its policy for controlling access to key
management functions.

FR:6.92 The CKMS design shall specify at a minimum:

       a) The granularity of the entities (e.g., person, device, organization),
                                              64

       b) If and how entities are identified,

       c) If and how entities are authenticated,

       d) If and how the entity authorizations are verified, and

       e) The access control on each key management function.

FR:6.93 The CKMS design shall specify the capabilities of its ACS to accommodate,
implement, and enforce the CKMS Security Policy.

                AC-3        A Federal CKMS shall control access to, and the initiation of,
PR:6.73
                AC-24       all its key and metadata management services and functions,
                            granting access to and permission to initiate a requested
                            service or function only after verifying the authorization of
                            the requesting entity to perform the requested service or
                            function.

6.7.2 Restricting Cryptographic Module Entry and Output of Plaintext Keys
An FCKMS should minimize human access to plaintext keys. The primary need for keys to
be in plaintext is when they are performing cryptographic functions within a cryptographic
module. A major concern is the entry and output of plaintext secret and private keys
into/from the cryptographic module.

Note that Section 6.4.19 addresses the entry of keys and metadata into a cryptographic
module, and Section 6.4.20 addresses the output from the module.

Also, note that Section 6.1.2 requires that keys for Moderate and High impact-level systems
be cryptographically protected from unauthorized disclosure when outside a cryptographic
module, i.e., when outside the module, secret and private keys need to be encrypted, rather
than in plaintext form. Therefore, the entry and output of plaintext secret and private keys is
only allowed for Low impact-level systems. However, Section 6.1.2 also recommends that
these keys be encrypted.

FR:6.94 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which plaintext secret or
plaintext private keys are entered into or output from a cryptographic module.

FR:6.95 If plaintext secret or plaintext private keys are entered into or output from any
cryptographic module, then the CKMS design shall specify how the plaintext keys are
protected and controlled outside of the cryptographic module.

FR:6.96 If plaintext secret or plaintext private keys are entered into or output from any
cryptographic module, then the CKMS design shall specify how such actions are audited.

6.7.3 Controlling Human Input
If a key-management function requires that a human input a key or sensitive metadata, the
human must accept responsibility for the accuracy and security of the input, as well as
entering the input at the proper time or when the proper event occurs. Minimizing human
                                            65
SP 800-152                                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


involvement during operations, resulting in a more transparent system, is usually more
desirable and may be more secure.

FR:6.97 For each key and metadata management function, the CKMS design shall specify
all human input parameters, their formats, and the actions to be taken by the CKMS if they
are not provided.

                             A Federal CKMS should minimize human involvement in
PA:6.18
                             entering and outputting keys and sensitive metadata to/from
                             the FCKMS.

6.7.4 Multiparty Control
Certain FCKMS key-management functions could require multiparty control. Requiring k of
n entities to be authorized by the FCKMS access-control system before the function is
performed could provide multiparty control. Multiparty controls should be used when
performing key-management functions for highly sensitive applications.

Of particular concern are the keys used by a Certificate Authority to sign certificates and any
keys used by the FCKMS for self-protection (e.g., the keys used to access other keys within
the FCKMS, such as the keys used to protect a database of keys).

FR:6.98 The CKMS design shall specify all functions that require multiparty control,
specifying k and n for each function.

FR: 6.99 For each multiparty function, the CKMS design shall cite or specify any known
rationale (logic, mathematics) as to why any k of the n entities can enable the desired
function, but k-1 of the entities cannot.

              AC-3 (2)      A Federal CKMS shall support multiparty control for
PR:6.74
                            managing and using Certificate Authority keys in High
                            impact-level systems.

              AC-3 (2)      A Federal CKMS should use multiparty control for managing
PA:6.19
                            and using Certificate Authority keys in Low and Moderate
                            impact-level systems.
                AC-3        A Federal CKMS should use multiparty control for Security
PA:6.20
                            Domain Authority functions.

6.7.5 Key Splitting
Key splitting is a technique for establishing multiparty control of keys. When a highly
sensitive key is required, the key is split into n key splits so that for some k (k < n), any k key
splits of the key can be used to form the key, but having any k1 key splits provides no
knowledge of the key value. Each of the n key splits is then provided to one of n trusted
entities so that the key cannot be formed unless k of the entities agree to take part. But if any

k-1 of the key splits are compromised, the key still could not be reconstructed by an attacker
having the k-1 key splits.

FR: 6.100 The CKMS design shall specify all keys that are managed using key splitting
techniques and shall specify n and k for each technique.

key splitting is done, and any known rationale (logic, mathematics) as to why any k of the n
key splits can form the key, but k-1 of the key splits provide no information about the key.

                           A Federal CKMS could use key splitting in order to

                           implement multiparty control of keys.

6.8   Compromise Recovery

A compromise is the unauthorized disclosure, modification, substitution, or use of sensitive
data (e.g., keys, metadata, or other security-related information) or the unauthorized
modification of a security-related system, device or process in order to gain unauthorized
access. An FCKMS should protect all keys and sensitive metadata so that they are not
disclosed, modified, substituted or used by unauthorized parties. This requires that all
components in the FCKMS remain secure.

However, since it is difficult to prevent all potential security problems that could arise from
all possible threats, an FCKMS should be designed to detect potential compromises and
unauthorized modifications, to mitigate their undesirable effects, to alert the appropriate
parties of compromises, and to recover (or help recover) to a secure state if a compromise or
unauthorized modification is discovered.

             CP-2          A Federal CKMS shall perform the following when a
PR:6.76
                           compromise is detected or suspected:
                              a) Report the compromise to FCKMS management,
                              b) Evaluate the compromise to determine its cause and
                                 scope,
                              c) Institute compromise-mitigation measures to minimize
                                 key and/or metadata exposure,
                              d) Institute corrective measures to prevent the recurrence
                                 of the compromise, and,
                              e) Return the FCKMS to a secure operating state.

6.8.1 Key Compromise
Key compromise is the disclosure of a key or its sensitive metadata to one or more
unauthorized entities, or the modification, substitution, or use of a cryptographic key or its


                                              67
SP 800-152                                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


sensitive metadata by one or more unauthorized entities. Depending on the key type and key
usage, the compromise of a key could result in:
      a) Loss of confidentiality,
      b) Loss of integrity,
      c) Loss of authentication,
      d) Loss of non-repudiation, or
      e) Some combination of these losses.
Note that a compromise of a secret or private key could result in a compromise of all the
information protected by the key and access to all security services supported by the key.
Also, note that the compromise of the sensitive metadata of a key may result in the
compromise of the key (see Section 6.8.2).

A key compromise could be prevented, undetected, detected, or suspected. An FCKMS
should be designed and operated to 1) prevent key compromises, 2) detect actual
compromises, 3) support the analysis of suspected compromises, and 4) minimize the risks of
undetected compromises. Establishing a cryptoperiod or usage limit for each key can reduce
the exposure caused by an undetected compromise7. See Section 6.8.1 of the Framework for
additional discussion.

A cryptographic key may be used for applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption or
generating a digital signature) or processing cryptographically protected information (e.g.,
decryption or verifying a digital signature). For symmetric algorithms, the same key is used
both to apply the protection and process the protected information. For public-key
algorithms, one key of a key pair is often used to apply the protection, and the other is used
to process the protected information; for public-key algorithms, key compromise is
concerned with the disclosure or modification of the private key of the key pair. Keys or key
pairs known or suspected of being compromised must not be used to apply cryptographic
protection, but they may be used to process cryptographically protected information, if
required and unmodified (e.g., for continuity of operations), and the risk of doing so is
acceptable.

An FCKMS should have the ability to rapidly revoke a key (see Section 6.8.3), replace keys
(both asymmetric and symmetric) and the ability to notify the relying parties (those who
make use of the key) of a compromise. A mobile FCKMS device should have the capability
of being deactivated remotely by the FCKMS management, and the sensitive keys and
metadata within the device should be destroyed if possible.

FR:6.102 The CKMS design shall specify the range of acceptable cryptoperiods or usage
limits of each type of key used by the system.

FR:6.103 For each key, a CKMS design shall specify the other key types that depend on the
key for their security and how those dependent keys are to be replaced in the event of a
compromise of the initial key.

    The usage of keys may be limited based on a criterion, such as the amount of data processed using the key.

6.8.2 Metadata Compromise
Some metadata may be considered sensitive, while other metadata is not. Metadata
compromise refers only to the compromise of the sensitive metadata. Depending on the
metadata element and how it is used, its compromise could result in the compromise of one
or more keys and the data protected by those keys. If different keys have common sensitive
metadata elements, then the compromise of one sensitive metadata element may compromise
the data protected by each of the keys. Metadata elements that are sensitive to unauthorized
modification should be cryptographically bound to their associated keys so that the integrity
of the metadata can be easily verified. Metadata elements that are sensitive to disclosure
should be physically or cryptographically protected.

FR:6.105 For each key type employed, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata
elements are sensitive to compromise (confidentiality, integrity, or source).

FR:6.106 The CKMS design shall specify the potential security consequences, given the
compromise (confidentiality, integrity or source) of each sensitive metadata element of a key.

can be remedied.

                           sensitive metadata associated with that key.

6.8.3 Key and Metadata Revocation
Keys could be revoked for a number of reasons, including key compromise, metadata
compromise, and the termination of an employee or the employee’s role within an
organization. Additional information is provided in Section 6.8.3 of the Framework.

FR:6.108 A CKMS design shall specify the key revocation mechanism(s) and associated
relying-entity notification mechanism(s) used or available for use.

6.8.4 Cryptographic Module Compromise
Since a cryptographic module contains plaintext keys at some point during its operation,
physical access to, and compromise of, a cryptographic module could compromise the
symmetric and private keys contained within the module, as well as any sensitive metadata
contained in the module. This could lead to the loss of confidentiality and/or integrity of the
keys and metadata.

Cryptographic modules could be compromised either physically (i.e., obtaining the keys by
physical penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure) or by non-invasive methods
(i.e., obtaining keys, or knowledge about the keys via some external action). Physical
protection could be provided to the modules by enclosing them in a facility or a protected
space where unauthorized access is prevented or where unauthorized access could be quickly
detected. Some modules provide this protection at their cryptographic boundary (see [FIPS
140]). If any access to the contents of a cryptographic module is possible, then an access
control system should restrict access to only authorized parties.

Following an actual or suspected cryptographic module compromise, a secure state of the
module must be re-established before the module is returned to normal operation, or the
module must be replaced. Following repair or replacement, the security and correct operation
of a module should be tested and approved before it becomes operational.

FR:6.109 The CKMS design shall specify how physical and logical access to the
cryptographic module contents is restricted to authorized entities.

FR:6.110 The CKMS design shall specify the approach to be used to recover from a
cryptographic module compromise.

FR:6.111 The CKMS design shall describe what non-invasive attacks are mitigated by the
cryptographic modules used by the system and provide a description of how the mitigation is
performed.

FR:6.112 The CKMS design shall identify any cryptographic modules that are vulnerable to
non-invasive attacks.

FR:6.113 The CKMS design shall provide the rationale for accepting the vulnerabilities
caused by possible non-invasive attacks.

An FCKMS must use cryptographic modules that protect against unauthorized access to their
contents (see Section 2.10 for requirements).

                            A Federal CKMS shall repair or replace a compromised
PR:6.82
                            cryptographic module and then verify its correct operation
                            and security before being used operationally.

6.8.5 Computer System Compromise Recovery
The security of an FCKMS often depends on the security and integrity of its own computer
systems, including its hardware, software, and data.              Unauthorized access to, or
modifications of, any of these could corrupt secure computer operation. Unauthorized
modification of FCKMS software or of a computer’s operating system could be detected
using tools that run on a separate secure platform and by monitoring any unauthorized
modification to a file, changes to the hash value of a file’s contents, or changes to a file’s
attributes. Alternatively, a layered system of protections could be built into the system; in this
case, the mechanisms would need to be protected from the same threats as the system itself.
When critical files undergo unauthorized modifications that are detected by the monitor or
are indicated in the event log, then these files should be replaced with known valid and
secure copies of those files obtained from secure backup storage.

An FCKMS could incorporate automated monitoring devices and software that detect certain
threats or compromises. For example, some communication networks monitor for and detect
errors that accidentally occur or have been induced in the network. If a network uses error-
detection codes for communications, the monitor could detect error propagation
characteristics that are outside the norm and initiate some compensating action to minimize
the result of this type of compromise. If cryptographic-based Message Authentication Codes
(MACs) are used in communications, certain deliberate and accidental modifications to the
data (e.g., keys and metadata) can be detected. Non-cryptographic error-detection codes are
not intended to detect deliberate modifications.

FR:6.114 The CKMS design shall specify the mechanisms used to detect unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.

FR:6.115 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS recovers from unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.

                                  A Federal CKMS could automatically detect and report some

                                  similar future compromises, and then return the system to a
                                  known secure state.

6.8.6 Network Security Controls and Compromise Recovery
A compromise of any network security control that provides protection to the
communications within an FCKMS could result in the compromise of the FCKMS itself,
including its keys. See Section 6.8.6 of the Framework for additional information.

Whenever network security has been compromised, the incident should be fully investigated
to determine what other systems and which keys may have been compromised due to the
compromise of the network.

FR:6.116 The CKMS design shall specify how to recover from the compromise of the
network security controls used by the system. Specifically,
       a) The CKMS design shall specify the compromise scenarios considered for each
          network security control device,
       b) The CKMS design shall specify which of the mitigation techniques specified in this
          section8 are to be employed for each envisioned compromise scenario, and
       c) The CKMS design shall specify any additional or alternative mitigation techniques
          that are to be employed.

6.8.7 Personnel Security Compromise Recovery
Anyone that is responsible for the secure operation of an FCKMS might have the capability
to compromise its security. An FCKMS should be designed and operated with capabilities
that minimize the likelihood of any successful human-initiated compromises, detect and
minimize the negative consequences of the compromises, and efficiently recover from such
compromises.

Any detected security failure should result in the initiation of recovery procedures, based
upon the Information Security Policy and the FCKMS capabilities.

                                b) Activate a backup facility and system with new keys

                                d) Revoke compromised keys.

6.8.8 Physical Security Compromise Recovery
Physical security should be used to both prevent and detect security compromises. In
addition to the disclosure or destruction of keys, a physical security breach of an FCKMS
module could result in compromises to the integrity of any of its internal components. A
cryptographic module may be designed with adequate physical protections, but if security-
related logic resides outside of the cryptographic module, then the integrity of that logic also
needs protection. Techniques similar to those used by the cryptographic module should be
employed. An FCKMS should support both prevention and detection mechanisms against
physical compromises.

If the physical security of an FCKMS module is breached, all sensitive data within the
breached area should be suspected of being compromised. The FCKMS components
associated with the FCKMS module should be examined to detect any unauthorized
modification or replacement. Compromised components should be repaired or replaced to
prevent new keys and sensitive information from being compromised in the future.

7 Interoperability and Transitioning
In general, interoperability is the ability of diverse systems to communicate and work
together (i.e., to inter-operate). In this document, two or more entities may be considered
interoperable if they are able to exchange cryptographic keys in a manner that complies with
Federal standards and is considered sufficiently secure by both entities. Since this document
allows for a variety of implementations to service many diverse applications, compliance
with this document does not by itself guarantee interoperability. Interoperability can only be
achieved by having a detailed specification and common protocols to which all
communicating entities intend to comply. These specifications and protocols may differ,
depending on the applications being serviced. If no interoperability is required, then the PRs
containing conditional interoperability phases are not applicable.

An FCKMS should use cryptographic algorithms and keys whose anticipated security
lifetimes will span the maximum lifetime of the information being protected. If the FCKMS
is intended to remain in service beyond the security lifetimes of its cryptographic algorithms,
then there should be a transition strategy for migration to stronger algorithms in the future.
Cryptographic algorithms should be implemented so that they can be replaced when needed.
[SP 800-57 Part 1] and [SP 800-131A] specify NIST-recommended lifetimes of NIST-
approved cryptographic algorithms. [SP 800-57 Part 1] provides transition guidance.

services, commands and data formats required to interoperate with other CKMS for which
interoperability is intended.

The following PRs specify default (i.e., mandatory-to-implement) algorithms (including
modes of operation, key-derivation methods, etc.) that provide FCKMS interoperability.
Other approved algorithms may be used instead of the defaults during interactions, if
previously agreed upon. Communication protocols generally include their own CKMS with
selected default algorithms for interoperability; as long as the algorithms used as defaults are
approved and are suitable for the impact level or security strength of the information being
communicated, the defaults in this section are not required.

Note that the minimum security strengths to be provided by the algorithms and keys for the
Low, Moderate and High impact levels are identified in PR:2.3, PR:2.4 and PR:2.5,
respectively.

8 Security Controls
An FCKMS consists of one or more computer systems, communication services, devices,
FCKMS modules, cryptographic modules, firewalls, communications and human interfaces,
backup storage media, archive facilities, network security protocols, and entity identification
systems. An FCKMS requires security mechanisms and management to protect FCKMS
devices and components, along with the keys and metadata that they contain. These controls
include physical security controls, operating system and device security controls, auditing
and remote monitoring, network security controls and cryptographic module controls.

8.1    Physical Security Controls

Physical security is needed to protect the availability, reliability, and integrity of an FCKMS
and to ensure the security and availability of its data-processing resources, including all key-
management information and support software. Without good physical security, the FCKMS
hardware and software could be modified to negate or bypass security mechanisms.

An FCKMS may include facilities that provide third-party key-management services (such as
a Certification Authority, Key Distribution Center, Registration Authority, or Certificate
Directory) and end-to-end communication devices (such as personal computers, personal
digital assistants, smart phones, and intelligent sensing devices).

A facility is traditionally considered to be a building or room that houses equipment and
support personnel in a fixed or “static” facility/environment. However, in today’s world of
mobile “smart” devices, the definition of a facility needs to be expanded to include the
enclosure in which a mobile FCKMS module is contained (e.g., a computer laptop case, or
cell phone protective cover), with some protection provided by its owner/user. A mobile
device enclosure and the person carrying the enclosed device should provide protection that
is similar to that available in a static facility and environment. In some instances, an FCKMS
could encompass a variety of static and mobile facilities.

In a static environment, an FCKMS module could be protected by gated fences, locked
doors, smart-card access-control systems, password verifiers, surveillance cameras, and
guards. In a mobile environment, security will depend on the room or enclosure in which the
mobile device and FCKMS module are currently operating, the person operating the mobile
device, and perhaps a personal identity-verification (PIV) mechanism that is built into the
device that requires an authorized owner/user to enter a special access token, secret
password, and/or personal biometric characteristic (e.g., fingerprint).

FR:8.1 The CKMS design shall specify each of its CKMS devices and their intended
purposes.

FR:8.2 The CKMS design shall specify the physical security controls for protecting each
device containing CKMS components.

8.2   Operating System and Device Security Controls

This section addresses security controls for FCKMS computer operating systems and
devices. Note that an FCKMS module or device that incorporates a general-purpose
operating system should also have computer security controls.

8.2.1 Operating System Security
A trusted (secure) operating system manages data to make sure that it cannot be altered,
moved, or viewed except by entities having appropriate and authorized access rights. A
trusted operating system should be the foundation of every modern, shared computing
system, personal computer, and “smart” device. Without a trusted operating system, the
security of the control programs, applications, and data on these personal devices cannot be
assured. Section 8.2.1 of the Framework provides guidance on the security features that
should be provided in trusted operating systems. A trusted operating system depends on a
secure hardware platform running secure (operating system) software. The platform often
supports two or more physically or logically separated processing capabilities in order to
isolate keys, metadata, security services, and cryptographic functions according to their
impact-levels, applications, users, or FCKMS Security Policies.

An FCKMS module might run on a general-purpose computer where non-validated
application code is permitted. In such cases, a trusted operating system should be used to
protect sensitive code and data from the non-validated code. The operating system should
protect itself from all applications and should separate applications from each other. A
trusted operating system is designed to provide these separations and is “trusted” to maintain
a secure environment. The trusted operating system, including the hardware platform, can
enforce two or more states in order to support privileged operations, such as memory
management, I/O management, and secure cryptographic function calls.

Software integrity in an FCKMS must be maintained to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
modification of the keys and metadata. Software integrity may be supported by using
integrity mechanisms such as hash functions, message authentication codes, and digital
signatures. Software integrity should be verified when the software is received from its
supplier, after initial installation, upon system startup, and periodically thereafter.

Hardening is the process of eliminating a means of attack by patching vulnerabilities and
turning off nonessential services. Hardening a computer involves several steps to form layers

8.2.2 Individual FCKMS Device Security
An FCKMS may include a variety of devices. An FCKMS should be designed to protect
itself from FCKMS device users and other FCKMS devices, to provide separate sessions for
users and user processes, to provide fine-grained access controls on FCKMS device-level
objects, to provide device-level security-event logging, and to provide entity account
management.

A verification that an FCKMS device is operating correctly and securely should be
established at device startup and verified periodically. The security controls incorporated
into an FCKMS device could be configurable to support differences in FCKMS service-using
organizations, security policies, and environments. Specific security-relevant events (such as
a physical security alarm, electric power failure, unrecoverable communication errors, and
human-initiated alarms) could result in different responses, depending on these differences.

FR:8.6 The CKMS design shall specify the security controls required for each CKMS
device.

FR:8.7 The CKMS design shall specify the device/CKMS secure configuration requirements
and guidelines that the hardening is based upon.

                 SI-6       The correct operation of each Federal CKMS device shall be
PR:8.8
                            verified during device start-up.


                            A Federal CKMS device could be manually or automatically
PF:8.2
                            configurable to support, comply with, and enforce new
                            FCKMS Security Policies.

8.2.3 Malware Protection
When an FCKMS receives operating-system software, software updates and software support
over electronic communication networks or via manual software distribution services, the
scanning of these data items for malware may be required before installation. Scanning must
be performed when the data items are untrusted, (i.e., they are received from an
unauthenticated or untrustworthy source, or the data does not have sufficient cryptographic
protection against undetected alteration, as determined by the impact-level of the data in the
system).

Malware protection falls into the following three general categories:

   a) Anti-virus software that protects an FCKMS from unwittingly installing and
      executing programs that perform unintended actions and may cause a security
      compromise,
   b) Anti-spyware software that protects an FCKMS from unauthorized parties obtaining
      system administrator status or authorized user status, and prevents the spyware from
      taking on authorized device behavior, and
   c) Rootkit detection and prevention software that protects FCKMS devices from rootkit
      malware that changes the configuration setting of the operating system in order to

                                              85
SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


         replace system code and hide processes and files, including the rootkit code itself,
         from anti-virus and anti-spyware software.

In order to be effective, malware protection should include verifying the identity of the
source of the received software upon receipt, and scanning the software for malware upon
initial receipt and periodically thereafter (e.g., upon reloading).

FR:8.8 The CKMS design shall specify the following malware protection capabilities for
CKMS devices:
   a) Anti-virus protection software, including the specified time periods and events that
      trigger anti-virus scans, software update, and virus signature database updates;
   b) Anti-spyware protection software, including the specified time periods and events
      that trigger anti-spyware scans, software update, and virus signature updates; and
   c) Rootkit detection and protection software, including the specified time periods and
      events that trigger rootkit detection, software update, and signature updates.

FR:8.9 The CKMS design shall specify the following software integrity check information
for operating system and CKMS application software:
   a) If software integrity is verified upon installation, indicate how the verification is
      performed; and
   b) If software integrity is verified periodically, indicate how often the verification is
      performed.

                             When untrusted software, software updates and software
PR:8.9
                             support may be introduced into the FCKMS, then the Federal
                             CKMS shall support the following malware protection
                             capabilities for itself and its devices:
                               a) Anti-virus protection software,
                               b) Anti-spyware protection software, and
                               c) Rootkit detection and protection software.
                             When a Federal CKMS receives untrusted software, software
PR:8.10
                             updates or software support, then the FCKMS shall perform
                             the following before installation:
                               a) Scan received data (including keys and metadata) when
                                  first received, and
                               b) Verify that the updated software/firmware contains no
                                  malware before running it.

8.2.4 Auditing and Remote Monitoring
An FCKMS should monitor security-relevant events by detecting and recording these events
in an audit log. The audit capability should also have the ability to detect any unusual events
that should be investigated and report them to the audit administrator role as soon as possible.
The audit capability and audit log must be protected from modification so that the integrity of
the audit system can be assured.

Automated assessment tools, such as those specified in the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) (see [SP 800-126]), should be considered for assessing the current security
status and integrity of an FCKMS. Such monitoring tools could execute on the platform
being monitored or on a platform dedicated to monitoring other computers.

FR:8.10 The CKMS design shall specify the auditable events supported and indicate
whether each event is fixed or selectable.

FR:8.11 For each selectable, auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the role(s) that
has the capability to select the event.

FR:8.12 For each auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the data to be recorded12.

system files to detect and/or prevent their modification or any modification to their security
attributes, such as their access control lists.

8.3   Network Security Control Mechanisms

Network security-control mechanisms should be used to protect computer systems and their
network communications against unauthorized access and use. They should be used to detect
and prevent network activities that could reduce the security of the transmitted information,
especially the cryptographic keys and sensitive metadata.

Networked FCKMS devices should be protected using a combination of firewalls and
intrusion detection and prevention systems as boundary-control devices. These devices
should be placed in physically secure locations and used to protect FCKMS users, sensitive
applications, and vulnerable network services. In order to provide defense-in-depth,
boundary-control functions should also be implemented directly in FCKMS devices.

An FCKMS could be designed to be configurable or dynamic, capable of adapting to
network threats based on the results of monitoring network performance, communication
error detection/correction, and network overload. For example, an attempt to flood a network
with repetitive or nonsense data could cause an FCKMS to not accept a data packet or
connection request. An intentional and intelligent, but unauthorized, modification of network
packets could result in packets being refused or a shutdown of the affected device or even the
entire network.

8.4   Cryptographic Module Controls

A cryptographic module is a set of hardware, software and/or firmware that implements
cryptographic-based security functions (e.g., cryptographic algorithms and key-establishment
schemes). [FIPS 140] specifies requirements on cryptographic modules that are used by the
Federal government. This Profile requires the use of FIPS 140-validated cryptographic
modules (see Section 2.10).

Two primary security issues should be addressed regarding the security of the contents of
cryptographic modules: the integrity of the security functions and the protection of the
cryptographic keys and metadata. Since cryptographic keys are present in plaintext form for
some period of time within the module, physical security measures are necessary to protect
keys from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and substitution.

Each [FIPS 140] cryptographic module must be used in accordance with the cryptographic
module’s security policy. This detailed security policy specifies the rules for operating the
cryptographic module, including the security rules that were applicable to the module and
derived from [FIPS 140], and those imposed by the module developer.

FR:8.19 The CKMS design shall identify the cryptographic modules that it uses and their
respective security policies, including:
   a) The embodiment of each module (software, firmware, hardware, or hybrid),
   b) The mechanisms used to protect the integrity of each module,
   c) The physical and logical mechanisms used to protect each module’s cryptographic
      keys, and
   d) The third-party testing and validation that was performed on each module (including
      the security functions) and the protective measures employed by each module.

PR:8.24                    A Federal CKMS shall use cryptographic modules in
                           accordance with the security policy of that module.

8.5   Federal CKMS Security-Control Selection and Assessment Process

Federal CKMS security controls should be selected, implemented, and used in a manner that
protects the FCKMS modules and cryptographic keys and metadata in accordance with [FIPS
199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-53], and [SP 800-53A].

The process specified in the following requirements is defined and explained in [FIPS 199],
[FIPS 200], [SP 800-53], and [SP800-53A]. The process will be used in Section 11 to
perform a security assessment.

The results of previous device and subsystem assessments complying with the procedures of
this section may be used with the approval of the System Authority without repeating the
assessments.

9 Testing and System Assurances
Prior to the procurement of an FCKMS or FCKMS services, an FCKMS should be
subjected to and pass several types of testing to ensure that it 1) conforms to its design
and required standards, 2) operates according to its design specifications, 3) rejects
service requests that could compromise its security, and 4) is interoperable with peer
FCKMSs (if required). Various types and levels of testing should be conducted to obtain
assurance that the FCKMS, including its modules and devices, performs as desired. The
results of all testing should be made available to Federal government officials (perhaps as
vendor-proprietary information15) in order to complete the evaluation processes.

                                   The results of all testing shall be provided to a Federal
PR:9.1               SA-11
                                   procurement authority for review prior to the acquisition of an

                                   and any third-party before procurement of the service.

 9.1       CKMS and FCKMS Testing

A CKMS, including its modules and devices, should undergo tests by its vendor to verify
that the CKMS performs according to its design and the CKMS Security Policy.
Similarly, an FCKMS should undergo tests by the FCKMS service provider to verify that
the FCKMS performs according to the FCKMS Security Policy.

 9.2       Third-Party Testing

An FCKMS vendor, service provider or service-using organization could initiate third-
party testing of an FCKMS module or device for conformance to selected standards or to
obtain specific information about the FCKMS. Third-party testing is intended to provide
confidence that the designer and implementer did not overlook some flaw in their own
testing procedures or error in the testing results. For example, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology has established several programs for validating conformance

                           All Federal CKMS modules and devices should be tested by

                           appropriate FCKMS procurement authorities for review.

9.3   Interoperability Testing

Interoperability testing, in its most general form, merely tests that two or more devices
can be interconnected and operate with one another. This means that the data exchanged
between the devices must be in a format that each device can process. Interoperable
devices may be interconnected to form a system, and interoperable systems may be
interconnected to form a network. Note that this type of testing does not necessarily test
the internal functioning of the individual device. If a device performs a unique function,
interoperability testing may not verify that function.

FR:9.3 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify the tests that have been performed and passed that verify the claim.

FR:9.4 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify any configuration settings that are required for interoperability.

                           If an FCKMS, FCKMS module, or FCKMS device claims
PR:9.6
                           interoperability with a reference implementation, then the
                           FCKMS, FCKMS module or FCKMS device shall be tested
                           and validated against the reference implementation.

9.4   Self-Testing

An FCKMS module or device could be designed, implemented, and operate correctly
when first deployed, but then fail some time later. A Federal CKMS must use modules
and devices that test themselves for functionality, integrity and security.

FR:9.5 The CKMS design shall specify all self-tests created and implemented by the
designer and the corresponding CKMS functions whose correct operation they verify.

                           A Federal CKMS shall perform initial and periodic self-tests

                           installation, update installation, system power-on, and then
                           daily thereafter.

                           installation, system power-on, and then daily thereafter.

9.5   Scalability Testing

Scalability is a characteristic of a system, network, or process to perform increasing
amounts of work correctly. Scalability testing involves testing a device or system to learn
how it reacts when the number of transactions to be processed or participants to be
serviced properly during a given period of time increases dramatically. Scalability testing
can be used to stress devices and systems so that overload problems are detected and
mitigated before encountering these problems during operational use.

FR:9.6 The CKMS design shall specify all scalability analysis and testing performed on
the system to date.

                           A Federal CKMS shall be subjected to scalability tests.
PR:9.9


9.6   Functional and Security Testing

Functional testing is used to verify that an implementation performs correctly. For
example, a functional test could verify that an implemented encryption algorithm
produces the correct ciphertext. Functional testing includes performing and passing the
types of tests specified in Sections 9.2 - 9.5 or obtaining evidence that these tests have
been performed and produced acceptable results.

Security testing is used to verify that an implementation operates securely. For example,
a security test could verify that fluctuations in power consumption or other outside
influences will not compromise the key of a correctly operating device. Thus, a

                                            96

cryptographic algorithm implementation may be required to pass both functional testing
and security testing.

Penetration testing is a specific type of security testing in which a team of testing experts
attacks one or more of a system’s computers or devices to defeat its security. Prior to
penetration testing, the FCKMS is analyzed for potential vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by the penetration team. Such vulnerabilities could result from an incomplete
CKMS design, an improper FCKMS configuration, hardware or software flaws, or
operational weaknesses in key-management services or technical countermeasures. The
scope of penetration testing should include FCKMS hardware, software, personnel
procedures, facilities, and environmental services. Any findings of, and conclusions
reached by, the penetration testing team should be addressed before initial deployment of
the FCKMS.

Note that individual FCKMS product/device penetration testing could be conducted as
part of an FCKMS security assessment (see Section 11).

FR:9.7 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing that was
performed on the system and the results of the tests.

                            were performed and produced acceptable results:
                                a) Third-party testing, where available,
                                b) Interoperability testing,
                                c) Self testing, and

                            changes.

PF:9.1
                           CKMS could be automated.

9.7   Environmental Testing

CKMS designers often assume a particular environment (e.g., temperature range and
voltage range) in which a proposed CKMS product will operate. The CKMS is then
designed, built and tested for use within that environment. If the products are used in a
different environment, secure operation could be lost. A CKMS being considered for
procurement for Moderate and High impact-level systems should either employ
environmental failure protection mechanisms or pass environmental testing before
becoming operational. Note that at security level 4, [FIPS 140] requires environmental
failure testing of cryptographic modules.

FR:9.8 The CKMS design shall specify the environmental conditions in which the
CKMS is designed to be used.

FR:9.9 The CKMS design shall specify the conditions that are required for its secure
operation.

FR:9.10 The CKMS design shall specify the results of environmental testing that was
performed on the CKMS devices, including the results of all tests stressing the devices
beyond the conditions for which they were designed.

                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, Federal CKMS
PA:9.6
                           modules should either employ environmental failure
                           protection mechanisms or pass environmental testing before
                           becoming operational.

9.8   Ease-of-Use Testing

An FCKMS should be easy to use, manage, and maintain. In order to evaluate ease-of-
use, a panel of people having different expertise and experience typically creates
evaluation criteria, and selects and monitors user-device-interface ease-of-use evaluation
tests that are performed by a test group of users.

An FCKMS could support a demonstration of correct FCKMS usage, and could be
designed to adapt to a user’s experience and abilities. An FCKMS must automatically
detect incorrect user input, including the length, format and range of the expected input
(see PR:3.2 in Section 3.4.2).

                            Federal CKMS interfaces shall be tested and approved by the
PR:9.14
                            service provider and the service using organization for ease-
                            of-use (including the features designed to detect and/or
                            mitigate incorrect user input) prior to procurement and when
                            any human-to-FCKMS interface changes are made.

9.9    Development, Delivery, and Maintenance Assurances

The secure development, delivery, and maintenance of CKMS products can play a
significant role in the security of the CKMS. The following areas should be considered:
   a) Configuration management,
   b) Secure delivery,
   c) Development and maintenance environmental security, and
   d) Flaw remediation.

Each of these areas is described in the following subsections.

9.9.1 Configuration Management
An FCKMS should incorporate products that are developed and maintained under an
appropriate configuration management system in order to ensure that security is not
reduced, and functional flaws are not introduced due to unauthorized or unintentional
changes to the products.

FR:9.11 The CKMS design shall specify:
   a) The devices (including their source code, documentation, build scripts, executable
      code, firmware, hardware design specification, documentation, and test code) to
      be kept under configuration control.
   b) The protection requirements (e.g., formal authorizations and proper record
      keeping) to ensure that only authorized changes are made to the components and
      devices under configuration control.

PR:9.15        CM-2        A Federal CKMS shall be under configuration management
               CM-3        during design, implementation, procurement, installation,
               CM-9        configuration, operation, maintenance, and final destruction.
               SA-10
                           The Federal CKMS configuration management system shall
PR:9.16
                           maintain records of the make, model, version, and
                           identification number of each FCKMS module and device.

9.9.2 Secure Delivery
When the computers, software, modules, and devices that are to be used in an FCKMS
are delivered, assurance of secure delivery (i.e. that the products received are the exact
products that were ordered) is required.

FR:9.12 The CKMS design shall specify secure delivery requirements for the products
used in the CKMS, including:
   a) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been tampered with
      during the delivery process or that tampering is detected,
   b) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been replaced during
      the delivery process or that replacement is detected,
   c) Protection requirements to ensure that an unrequested delivery is detected, and
   d) Protection requirements to ensure that the product delivery is not suppressed or
      delayed and that suppression or delay is detected.

PR:9.17        SA-12       A Federal CKMS shall verify that:
               (+10)           a) The delivered product has not been tampered with
                                  during the delivery process,
                               b) The product has not been replaced during the delivery
                                  process,
                               c) Delivered but unauthorized items are not used, and
                               d) Product delivery is not suppressed or delayed.
               SA-12       A Federal CKMS shall support the notification of FCKMS
PR:9.18
                           management personnel when:
                               a) Any modification or replacement of the expected
                                  delivery item is detected,
                               b) Any delay or cancellation of product delivery is
                                  detected, or
                               c) Any unauthorized delivery is received.

9.9.3 Development and Maintenance Environmental Security
The CKMS development and FCKMS maintenance environments must be protected
against physical, technical, and personnel threats. Tools such as compilers, software
loaders, and text editors should not be automatically trusted.

FR:9.13 The CKMS design shall specify the security requirements for the development
and maintenance environments of the CKMS, including:
   a) Physical security requirements,
   b) Personnel security requirements, such as clearances and background checks for
      developers, testers, and maintainers,
   c) Procedural security, such as multiparty control and separation of duties,

   d) Computer security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment and to provide access control to permit authorized user access,
   e) Network security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment from hacking attempts,
   f) Cryptographic security control to protect the integrity of software and its control
      data under development, and
   g) The means used to ensure that the tools (e.g., editors, compiler, software linkers,
      loaders, etc.) are trustworthy and are not sources of malware.

PR:9.19                     A Federal CKMS service-providing organization shall verify
                            that the CKMS designer, developer, and implementer
                            followed the claimed procedures for the development and
                            maintenance environment documented in FR:9.13.
               MA-1         A Federal CKMS shall protect against physical, technical,
PR:9.20
               SA-18        and personnel threats during FCKMS maintenance activities.

9.9.4 Flaw Remediation Capabilities
The detection, reporting, and correction of FCKMS flaws must be done in an expeditious
and secure manner. Users should report potential and detected flaws to the FCKMS
management. An FCKMS that employs automated flaw-detection techniques is highly
desirable because it can continuously monitor its own security status, report potential
problems to an authorized person fulfilling an appropriate FCKMS role, and minimize
reliance on human monitoring of events that occur infrequently.

FR:9.14 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capabilities for detecting system
flaws, including:
   a) Known-answer tests,
   b) Error detection codes,
   c) Anomaly diagnostics, and
   d) Functional Testing.

FR:9.15 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for reporting flaws,
including: the capability to produce status report messages with confidentiality, integrity
and source authentication protections, and to detect unauthorized delays.

FR:9.16 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for analyzing flaws and
creating/obtaining fixes for likely or commonly known flaws.

FR:9.17 The CKMS design shall specify its capability to transmit fixes with
confidentiality, integrity and source authentication protections and to detect unauthorized
delays.

FR:9.18 The CKMS design shall specify its capability for implementing fixes in a timely
manner.

10 Disaster Recovery
An FCKMS failure could hamper or prevent access to an organization’s information. For
example, the inability to decipher information because the key is destroyed or
unrecoverable will prevent access to the plaintext data because the information cannot be
decrypted. This section describes how operational continuity can be achieved in the event
of device failures or the corruption of keys and metadata.

Disaster recovery requires having procedures and sufficient backup capability to recover
from facility damage, utility service outages, communication and computation outages,
hardware and software failures, and other failures that result in the corruption of keys and
metadata.

Several of the PRs and PAs in this section include a specific time frame for recovery.
Alternatively, recovery could be in accordance with a Service Level Agreement (SLA)
between a service provider and a service-using organization; the SLA is a service
contract where the service is formally defined. The specific times provided in the PRs
and PAs can be used to determine whether recovery times specified in the SLA are
reasonable for the FCKMS and its associated applications. Note that the required
recovery times may not be the same for all applications, so the time frames provided in
an SLA can be customized.

                             detected failure within 24 hours or a time period specified in
                             a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

             CP-2 (3, 4)     A Federal CKMS could have procedures and sufficient

                             following a detected failure.

10.1 Facility Damage

FCKMS components should be located in physically secure and environmentally
protected facilities. Facilities may be either fixed or mobile.

For an FCKMS module in a fixed facility, wind, water and fire damage are common
risks. For mobile facilities, risks also include physical damage, accidental loss, theft,
destruction, and a higher probability of use by unauthorized entities than is the case for a
fixed facility. For mobile devices that contain FCKMS capabilities, the enclosure is
considered to be the facility (see Section 8.1) and should have physical protection against
unauthorized access to the device’s electronics. Mobile devices could be provided with
waterproof containers and owner-identity verification mechanisms (e.g., fingerprint
                                            103
SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


scanner and verifier). However, low-cost mobile devices often do not have the built-in
tamper protection features of a fixed device. Therefore, the owner who carries and uses a
secure mobile device is responsible for protecting it against physical damage, loss, and
unauthorized use.

Mobile devices have the advantage that they may be easily replaced when they are
damaged.

Whether an FCKMS module is operated in a fixed or mobile facility, a backup facility or
capability should be available, and the FCKMS should support reporting and recovery
procedures in the event of damage to a primary FCKMS facility. FCKMS facilities
should be designed, implemented, and operated in a manner commensurate with the value
and sensitivity of the information being protected.

When a facility is damaged, secret and private keys and keys associated with sensitive
metadata that could have been disclosed should be immediately placed on Compromised
Key Lists or Certificate Revocation Lists and replaced.

FR:10.1The CKMS design shall specify the required environmental, fire, and physical
access control protection mechanisms and procedures for recovery from damage to the

                            A Federal CKMS could have one or more archive facilities
PF:10.2
                            for long-term storage of keys and metadata.

10.2 Utility Service Outage

An FCKMS module in a fixed facility requires reliable utility services (e.g., electrical
power) for assuring its availability. Other required services could include water, sewer,
air conditioning, heat, and clean air. Adequate utility services in all primary and backup
fixed facilities must be available to support all electronic devices, human safety and
comfort during normal operations and emergencies, and should be provided to all
primary and backup facilities.

Mobile devices with FCKMS capabilities will require battery chargers and may require
backup batteries.

Backup systems should have utility services that are independent from those of the
primary system. For example, a surge from a power-line lightning strike could cause
both the primary system and its backup to fail if they are both served by the same power
line.

FR:10.2 The CKMS design shall specify the minimum, as well as recommended
electrical, water, sanitary, heating, cooling, and air filtering requirements for the primary
and all backup facilities.

                PE-9 (1)     A Federal CKMS shall be provided with sufficient utility
PR:10.10
                 PE-11       services to support all primary and backup fixed facilities
                 PE-12       during both normal operation and emergencies.
                             A Federal CKMS shall conform to applicable Federal and
PR:10.11
                             industry standards for utility assurance and satisfy the
                             CKMS design requirements for utility services for all
                             primary, backup, and archive facilities.
              CP-8 (3)       For High impact-level systems, the utility service for a
PR:10.12
                             backup system of a Federal CKMS shall be independent
                             from that of the primary system.

              CP-8 (3)       For Low and Moderate impact-level systems, the utility
PA:10.6

                             independent from that of the primary system.

10.3 Communication and Computation Outage

An FCKMS needs sufficient communication and computation capabilities to perform its
required functions and to provide the key-management services that are required by its
users. Backup communication and computation capabilities should be provided by an
FCKMS in the event of system failure. The ability to access alternative communication
services is highly desirable in the event of a communication-service failure.

FR:10.3 The CKMS design shall specify the communications and computation

assure continued operation of services commensurate with the anticipated needs of users,

                CP-8 (3)     services is required, a Federal CKMS shall have backup
                CP-9 (6)     communications, computation, and electrical services
                 CP-11       available that can be activated as needed.

             CP-8 (+1, 2,    computation or communication failures within twelve hours
                 3)          or in a time period specified within a Service-Level
                             Agreement (SLA).

             CP-7 (+3, 4) A Federal CKMS could support automatic switching to
PF:10.3
                          backup computation and communication services within
                          fifteen minutes of a detected utility-service outage.

10.4 FCKMS Hardware Failure

Since an FCKMS is critical for the secure operation of the information-management
system that it supports, it is desirable to minimize the impact of hardware failures of
FCKMS components and devices. Replacement parts should be available for critical
devices, or complete system redundancy should be available to obtain assurance that the
operational impact of a hardware failure is minimal, i.e., limited to reduced performance
and response time. Some backup systems maintain real-time synchronization with the
primary system. Such systems are capable of immediately taking over the responsibilities
of the primary system. Other systems synchronize periodically and have a catch-up
procedure to bring the backup system up to the state that the primary system had just
before the failure occurred.

It is essential that backup systems have as much independence from the primary system
as possible so that a failure to the primary system does not also result in the same failure
to the backup. Multiple backup systems could be used to provide error-detection
capabilities.

Redundant FCKMS devices can be used to provide error-detection and correction
capabilities. Two FCKMS devices performing the same services can detect discrepancies
in the results of a key-management function; three systems, all performing the same
function, can detect a failure in one system and correct a single failure using the results of
the other two devices, assuming that the results are the same. Since redundancy
multiplies the cost of providing key-management services, FCKMS service-providing
organizations should attempt to find an optimum trade-off between redundancy and cost.

                            hours of a failure or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement.

                            A Federal CKMS could repair or replace failed hardware and
PF:10.4
                            be returned to operational status within one hour of a failure
                            when high availability is required.
                            A Federal CKMS could automatically verify the operational
PF:10.5
                            readiness of its backup services.

10.5 System Software Failure

Software errors can have security results ranging from minor problems to catastrophic
failures. Corrupted software must be detected using integrity tests and replaced as soon
as possible if errors are found; such tests include the computation of cryptographic error-
detection codes (e.g., message authentication codes and digital signatures) and other
values determined by the code itself (i.e., known answers) that are periodically
recomputed on the currently used software for comparison with the originally computed
values to verify that the software is still correct. If an error is detected, an error state
should be entered, and an error report should be sent to the FCKMS management.

When a primary FCKMS facility is restored from backup, the most recent information
since the last secure state was backed up could be missing, since it was not included in
the backup. Full secure-state FCKMS backups should be performed on a regular basis,
and the latest FCKMS secure state should be reloaded into a repaired-and-ready FCKMS
component or device upon the detection of a software failure.

Note that when a primary FCKMS facility is restored from backup, the most recent
information since the last secure state was backed up could be missing, since it may have
not been included in the backup.

                            A Federal CKMS shall perform full secure-state backups at

                            Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS shall ensure that all software errors are
PR:10.24
                            analyzed and repaired before the system is returned to a fully
                            operational state.

                            A Federal CKMS could automatically verify correct
PF:10.6
                            operation of the FCKMS software and hardware by randomly

                            simultaneously in the primary and backup facilities and
                            verifying that the results are identical.

10.6 Cryptographic Module Failure

Cryptographic modules should have built-in tests that are adequate to detect hardware,
software, or firmware failures. [FIPS-140]-validated modules perform pre-operational,
conditional, and periodic self-tests. If a failure is detected, the module enters an error
state that outputs an error indicator and determines if the error is a non-recoverable type
(i.e. one that requires service, repair, or replacement) or a recoverable type (i.e., one that
requires initialization or resetting). If the error is recoverable, the module should be
rebooted and pass all power-up self-tests before performing normal processing. If the
error recurs after repeated attempts to reboot, then the module should be replaced.

PF:10.7
                           processing to a backup cryptographic module upon detection
                           or suspicion of a cryptographic module failure.

10.7 Corruption and Loss of Keys and Metadata

Cryptographic keys and metadata can be corrupted or lost during transmission or in
storage. If a lost key, a corrupted key, or a key with corrupted metadata, has been used to
protect data, the security consequences should be evaluated, since a loss or compromise
of sensitive data could result.

Lost keys must be revoked, but may be recovered from reliable storage if used only for
processing already-protected information, and the risk of doing so is acceptable. Users
must be aware that the key may have been compromised, and the protected data is
suspect.

Corrupted keys and metadata should be either replaced or recovered from reliable storage
(e.g., backup) as soon as the corruption is detected if needed for continued operation.

FR:10.11 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for backing-up and archiving
cryptographic keys and their metadata.

FR:10.1210.5 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for restoring or replacing
corrupted keys and metadata that have been stored or transmitted.

11 Security Assessment
Security should be assessed periodically throughout the entire lifetime of a Federal
CKMS. This section describes assessments that should be made prior to its initial
operation, during periodic (e.g., annual) reviews, and after major changes. For additional
information on security assessment practices and controls, see [SP 800-37], [SP 800-53],
[SP 800-53A], and [SP 800-115].

A team of experienced people should perform a security assessment with expertise in
several areas that are selected, based on the type of assessment being conducted. A
security-assessment team should consist of individuals who possess expertise in these
areas and in the planned security assessment topic.

                           A Federal CKMS should be subjected to security assessments
PA:11.1
                           by a team of people that collectively have experience and
                           expertise in:
                             a) Computer security,
                             b) Cryptography,
                             c) Cryptographic protocols,
                             d) Distributed system design,
                             e) Human usability/accessibility requirements,
                             f) Key management,
                             g) Network security,
                             h) Information security,
                             i) Secure information system laws, regulations and
                                 standards,
                             j) Secure system design, and
                             k) Security assessments.

11.1 Full Security Assessment

               CA-2      A Federal CKMS shall undergo and pass a full security
PR:11.2
                         assessment under the following circumstances:
                          a) Before initial operation,
                          b) After a significant change to any policy affecting the
                             security of the FCKMS,
                          c) After major system changes, and
                          d) Immediately after the occurrence or suspected
                             occurrence of a compromise.

                         A Federal CKMS should support all interfaces that are
PA:11.2
                         needed for testing by a security-assessment team.

11.1.1 Review of Third-Party Testing and Verification of Test Results
Even though no formal validation programs for the security of an entire FCKMS
currently exist, certain programs have been established to test parts of the FCKMS,
including:
   a) NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), which tests NIST-
      approved cryptographic algorithms against their specifications,
   b) NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), which tests
      cryptographic modules against the requirements in [FIPS 140], and
   c) The National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which tests non-
      cryptographic software and hardware against the Common Criteria Standard (see
      [ISO 15408 Parts 1- 3]).
Even though these programs do not guarantee security, they can significantly increase
confidence in the security and integrity of an FCKMS.

FR:11.3 The CKMS design shall specify all validation programs under which any of the
CKMS devices have been validated.

                            used by the FCKMS have been validated for conformance to
                            FIPS 140 under the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation
                            Program (CMVP).

                            During a full security assessment, the assessment team for a
PA:11.3
                            Federal CKMS should verify that non-cryptographic software
                            and hardware (e.g. operating systems, DBMS, or firewalls)
                            used in or by the FCKMS have been validated using the
                            Common Criteria Standard (see [ISO 15408 Parts 1- 3]) under
                            the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)

11.1.2 Architectural Review of System Design
An architectural review is an examination of a system’s security architecture by a
qualified team of experts to determine that the basic design is consistent with its security
goals. This review is required in Section 11.1 for all FCKMS(s).

FR:11.5 The CKMS design shall specify whether an architectural review is required as
part of the full security assessment.

FR:11.6 If an architectural review is required, then the CKMS design shall specify the
skill set required by the architectural review team.

                            During an architectural review, the assessment team for a
PR:11.5
                            Federal CKMS shall have access to all CKMS design
                            information, third-party-validation information, and the
                            available results of FCKMS/CKMS testing.

                            When penetration testing is to be performed on a Federal
PA:11.4
                            CKMS, the penetration-testing scenarios should be
                            determined by the architectural review team.
             SA-4           A Federal CKMS using-organization should analyze the
PA:11.5
                            results of the architectural review before procuring an
                            FCKMS.

11.1.3 Functional and Security Testing
Functional and security testing of an FCKMS should be performed prior to initial
deployment, during subsequent periodic security reviews, and during incremental
security assessments. Functional and security tests could be performed by the CKMS
developer, CKMS implementer, the FCKMS service provider, or a trusted third-party.
These tests could also be performed, or the results reviewed, by an FCKMS-using
organization.

Functional testing should include usability tests for users whose knowledge and
experience with an FCKMS range from novice to expert. An FCKMS is considered to be
“user-friendly” when it can be easily used by novice users, or when the services are
automatically provided and controlled by an FCKMS that is “transparent” to the user.

FR:11.7 The CKMS design shall specify all required functional and security testing of
the CKMS.

FR:11.8 The CKMS design shall report the results of all functional and security tests
performed to date.

             SA-11         A Federal CKMS shall undergo functional and security
PR:11.6
                           testing, including ease-of-use tests before initial operation.


                           A Federal CKMS could automatically test the security and
PF:11.1
                           functionality of all of its services that are intended to support
                           and interact with other security domains and report the results
                           to all participating security domain administrators.

11.1.4 Penetration Testing
Penetration tests are used to determine the extent to which a system resists active
attempts to compromise its security. This type of testing requires security experts who are
knowledgeable about typical system weaknesses and attacks against them, and who can
create new or unsuspected attack methods. The penetration-testing team for an FCKMS
should include some individuals who are not part of the CKMS design or implementation
team and who do not have preconceived notions about its security.

FR:11.9 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any completed penetration testing
performed to date.

                CA-8       Penetration testing shall be performed on High impact-level
PR:11.7
                           Federal CKMSs.

                           A penetration-testing team should include individuals with
PA:11.6
                           experience in computer and communication systems design
                           and testing, software testing, vulnerability analysis, and
                           security threat analysis.
              SA-11 (5)    When penetration testing has been performed on a Federal
PA:11.7
                           CKMS, the system should undergo penetration testing at least
                           every two years or in accordance with a Service Level
                           Agreement.

11.2 Periodic Security Review

FCKMS system controls, physical controls, procedural controls and personnel controls
should be reviewed periodically to ensure that these controls are in place and operational.
Issues identified from the review should be addressed. In addition, periodic functional
and security testing should be performed (see Section 9.6).

FR:11.10 The CKMS design shall specify the periodicity of security reviews.

FR:11.11 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the security review in terms of
the CKMS devices.

FR:11.12 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the periodic security review in
terms of the activities undertaken for each CKMS device under review.

FR:11.13 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing to be
performed as part of the periodic security review.

             CA-2          The security of a Federal CKMS shall be reviewed annually
PR:11.9
                           or in accordance with a Service Level Agreement to assure
                           that it is operating with the latest security updates,
                           incorporating all current CKMS implementer-supported
                           software.

             CA-7          A Federal CKMS could perform continuous monitoring of its

                           security-critical key-management processing and data storage
                           capabilities, modules, and devices.

11.3 Incremental Security Assessment

An incremental security assessment is limited in scope and should be conducted after any
change is made to the FCKMS that is not a major change to the system or the result of a
security compromise (both of which require a full security assessment, as specified in
Section 11.1). The scope of the assessment is limited to the specific change involved and
any effects that the change could have on the FCKMS performance or security.

PR:11.12
                          shall include the identification of any changes to the system
                          since the last security assessment, an architectural review of
                          any design changes, and functional and security testing of the
                          FCKMS.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support producing a report following
PR:11.13
                           an incremental security assessment that includes the
                           following:

                          to an existing security policy associated with an FCKMS.

11.4 Security Maintenance

While an FCKMS could be designed, implemented, and operated to provide a specific
impact-level (e.g., Low, Moderate, or High), the protection provided could be reduced if
configuration changes are made or when new threats are identified. In order to maintain
or enhance the security of an FCKMS, it should be upgraded in accordance with
hardening guidelines (see Section 8.2.1).

12 Technological Challenges
A CKMS should be designed and implemented to have a security lifetime of many years.
The CKMS designer, FCKMS service provider and the FCKMS service-using
organization should periodically evaluate possible threats resulting from advances in
technology that may render its key-management services insecure, including16:

       a) New attacks on cryptographic algorithms,

             Throughout the lifetime of a Federal CKMS, the CKMS
PA:12.1
             designer/developer, and the FCKMS service-providing and
             service-using organizations should evaluate possible threats
             to the FCKMS resulting from advances in technology that
             may render the FCKMS insecure, including:
               a) New attacks on cryptographic algorithms,
               b) New attacks on key-establishment protocols,
               c) New attacks on FCKMS devices,
              d) New computing technologies that could reduce the
                 security provided by a cryptographic algorithm,
              e) New attacks on access control mechanisms, and
              f) New mathematical attacks that could reduce the
                 protection provided by a cryptographic algorithm and a
                 fixed key length.
             FCKMS management should assure that a periodic review of
PA:12.2
             the advances in technology is conducted in order to determine
             the feasibility and desirability of system improvements.

             Federal CKMS administrators could review the current
PF:12.1
             FCKMS technology used in security-domain policy
             specification, negotiation, and/or enforcement to determine if
             an upgrade or replacement of the FCKMS is needed.

This glossary defines terms that are used in this Profile, some of which may also be
defined in the Framework.

Access control system      A set of procedures and/or processes, normally automated,
                           which allows access to a controlled area or to information to
                           be controlled, in accordance with pre-established policies and
                           rules.
Active state               A lifecycle state for a key in which the key may be used to
                           cryptographically protect information (e.g., encrypt plaintext
                           or generate a digital signature), to cryptographically process
                           previously protected information (e.g., decrypt ciphertext or
                           verify a digital signature) or both.
Approved security          A security function (e.g., cryptographic algorithm,
function                   cryptographic key management technique, or authentication
                           technique) that is either

                           reviewing an audit log, assuring that the log is reviewed
                           periodically and after any security-compromise-relevant
                           event, and providing audit reports to FCKMS managers.
Auditor                    See Audit administrator.
Authorization              The process of verifying that a requested action or service is
