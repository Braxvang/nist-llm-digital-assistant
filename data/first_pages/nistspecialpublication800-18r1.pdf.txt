Executive Summary
The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources.
All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require protection as part of good
management practice. The protection of a system must be documented in a system security plan.
The completion of system security plans is a requirement of the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” Appendix III, “Security
of Federal Automated Information Resources,” and” Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of
the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who
access the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured
process of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system. It should reflect input
from various managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners,
the system owner, and the senior agency information security officer (SAISO). Additional
information may be included in the basic plan and the structure and format organized according to
agency needs, so long as the major sections described in this document are adequately covered and
readily identifiable.

In order for the plans to adequately reflect the protection of the resources, a senior management
official must authorize a system to operate. The authorization of a system to process information,
granted by a management official, provides an important quality control. By authorizing
processing in a system, the manager accepts its associated risk.

Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management, operational, and
technical controls. Since the system security plan establishes and documents the security controls,
it should form the basis for the authorization, supplemented by the assessment report and the plan
of actions and milestones. In addition, a periodic review of controls should also contribute to
future authorizations. Re-authorization should occur whenever there is a significant change in
processing, but at least every three years.




                                                                                               vii

1. Introduction
Today's rapidly changing technical environment requires federal agencies to adopt a
minimum set of security controls to protect their information and information systems.
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies the minimum security
requirements for federal information and information systems in seventeen security-
related areas. Federal agencies must meet the minimum security requirements defined in
FIPS 200 through the use of the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. NIST SP 800-53
contains the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures
prescribed for an information system. The controls selected or planned must be
documented in a system security plan. This document provides guidance for federal
agencies for developing system security plans for federal information systems.


1.1 Background
Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA), requires each federal agency to develop, document, and implement an
agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the
information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,
including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.
System security planning is an important activity that supports the system development
life cycle (SDLC) and should be updated as system events trigger the need for revision in
order to accurately reflect the most current state of the system. The system security plan
provides a summary of the security requirements for the information system and
describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
plan also may reference other key security-related documents for the information system
such as a risk assessment, plan of action and milestones, accreditation decision letter,
privacy impact assessment, contingency plan, configuration management plan, security
configuration checklists, and system interconnection agreements as appropriate.


1.2 Target Audience
Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization must
understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the information
system and those responsible for defining system requirements should be familiar with
the system security planning process. Those responsible for implementing and managing
information systems must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their
systems. This guidance provides basic information on how to prepare a system security
plan and is designed to be adaptable in a variety of organizational structures and used as
reference by those having assigned responsibility for activity related to security planning.


1.3 Organization of Document
This publication introduces a set of activities and concepts to develop an information
system security plan. A brief description of its contents follows:


                                                                                         1
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



    •    Chapter 1 includes background information relevant to the system security
         planning process, target audience, information on FIPS 199, Standards for
         Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, a
         discussion of the various categories of information systems, identification of
         related NIST publications, and a description of the roles and responsibilities
         related to the development of system security plans.
    •    Chapter 2 discusses how agencies should analyze their information system
         inventories in the process of establishing system boundaries. It also discusses
         identification of common security controls and scoping guidance.
    •    Chapter 3 takes the reader through the steps of system security plan development.
    •    Appendix A provides a system security plan template.
    •    Appendix B provides a glossary of terms and definitions.
    •    Appendix C includes references that support this publication.


1.4 Systems Inventory and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 199)
FISMA requires that agencies have in place an information systems inventory. All
information systems in the inventory should be categorized using FIPS 199 as a first step
in the system security planning activity.

FIPS 199 is the mandatory standard to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all
information and information systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each
agency based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security
according to impact. Security categorization standards for information and information
systems provide a common framework and understanding for expressing security that, for
the federal government, promotes: (i) effective management and oversight of information
security programs, including the coordination of information security efforts throughout
the civilian, national security, emergency preparedness, homeland security, and law
enforcement communities; and (ii) consistent reporting to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) and Congress on the adequacy and effectiveness of information security
policies, procedures, and practices.


1.5 Major Applications, General Support Systems, and Minor Applications
All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled as a
major application1 or general support system.2 Specific system security plans for minor




1
  OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines major application as an application that requires special
attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to or modification of the information in the application.
2
  OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines general support system as an interconnected set of
information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. It
normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and people.


                                                                                                       2
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


applications3 are not required because the security controls for those applications are
typically provided by the general support system or major application in which they
operate. In those cases where the minor application is not connected to a major
application or general support system, the minor application should be briefly described
in a general support system plan that has either a common physical location or is
supported by the same organization. Additional information is provided in Chapter 2.


1.6 Other Related NIST Publications
In order to develop the system security plan, it is necessary to be familiar with NIST
security standards and guidelines. It is essential that users of this publication understand
the requirements and methodology for information system categorization as described in
NIST FIPS 199 as well as the requirements for addressing minimum security controls for
a given system as described in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems, and FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
information and Information System.

Other key NIST publications directly supporting the preparation of the security plan are
NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, and
NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal
Information Systems. All documents can be obtained from the NIST Computer Security
Resource Center website at: http://csrc.nist.gov/.


1.7 System Security Plan Responsibilities
Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process. System security
plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and plans of action
and milestones for implementing security controls. Procedures should be in place
outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan current, and follows up on planned
security controls. In addition, procedures should require that system security plans be
developed and reviewed prior to proceeding with the security certification and
accreditation process for the system.

During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security plan is
analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the security
controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS 199 security
category determined for the information system, and that the threat and vulnerability
identification and initial risk determination are identified and documented in the system
security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document. The results of a security
certification are used to reassess the risks, develop the plan of action and milestones
(POA&Ms) which are required to track remedial actions, and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security

3
 NIST Special Publication 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than a major
application, that requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss,
misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications
are typically included as part of a general support system.


                                                                                                         3

accreditation decision. For additional information on the certification and accreditation
process, see NIST SP 800-37. Figure 1, depicts the key inputs/outputs into the security
planning process.




                    Figure 1: Security Planning Process Inputs/Outputs


The roles and responsibilities in this section are specific to information system security
planning. Recognizing that agencies have widely varying missions and organizational
structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for security planning-related
roles and how the associated responsibilities are allocated among agency personnel (e.g.,
multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual filling multiple roles4).

1.7.1 Chief Information Officer
The Chief Information Officer (CIO)5 is the agency official responsible for developing
and maintaining an agency-wide information security program and has the following
responsibilities for system security planning:

     •   Designates a senior agency information security officer (SAISO) who shall carry
         out the CIO's responsibilities for system security planning,

4
  Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiple roles in the security planning process to
ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of
interest.
5
  When an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities
to be handled by a comparable agency official.


                                                                                                    4
                       Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



     •   Develops and maintains information security policies, procedures, and control
         techniques to address system security planning,

     •   Manages the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security
         controls,

     •   Ensures that personnel with significant responsibilities for system security plans
         are trained,

     •   Assists senior agency officials with their responsibilities for system security
         plans, and

     •   Identifies and coordinates common security controls for the agency.

1.7.2 Information System Owner
The information system owner6 is the agency official responsible for the overall
procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of
the information system. The information system owner has the following responsibilities
related to system security plans:

    •    Develops the system security plan in coordination with information owners, the
         system administrator, the information system security officer, the senior agency
         information security officer, and functional "end users,"

    •    Maintains the system security plan and ensures that the system is deployed and
         operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements,

    •    Ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security
         training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior),

    •    Updates the system security plan whenever a significant change occurs, and

    •    Assists in the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common
         security controls.

1.7.3 Information Owner
The information owner is the agency official with statutory or operational authority for
specified information and responsibility for establishing the controls for its generation,
collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner has the
following responsibilities related to system security plans:

6
 The role of the information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the
particular agency and the system development life cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies
may refer to information system owners as program managers or business/asset/mission owners.



                                                                                                   5
                       Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



    •   Establishes the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject
        data/information (rules of behavior),7

    •   Provides input to information system owners regarding the security requirements
        and security controls for the information system(s) where the information resides,

    •   Decides who has access to the information system and with what types of
        privileges or access rights, and

    •   Assists in the identification and assessment of the common security controls
        where the information resides.

1.7.4 Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO)
The senior agency information security officer is the agency official responsible for
serving as the CIO's primary liaison to the agency's information system owners and
information system security officers. The SAISO has the following responsibilities
related to system security plans:

    •   Carries out the CIO's responsibilities for system security planning,

    •   Coordinates the development, review, and acceptance of system security plans
        with information system owners, information system security officers, and the
        authorizing official,

    •   Coordinates the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common
        security controls, and

    •   Possesses professional qualifications, including training and experience, required
        to develop and review system security plans.

1.7.5 Information System Security Officer
The information system security officer is the agency official assigned responsibility by
the SAISO, authorizing official, management official, or information system owner for
ensuring that the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an
information system or program. The information system security officer has the
following responsibilities related to system security plans:

    •   Assists the senior agency information security officer in the identification,
        implementation, and assessment of the common security controls, and




7
 The information owner retains that responsibility even when the data/information are shared with other
organizations.


                                                                                                    6
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


    •    Plays an active role in developing and updating the system security plan as well as
         coordinating with the information system owner any changes to the system and
         assessing the security impact of those changes.

1.7.6 Authorizing Official
The authorizing official (or designated approving/accrediting authority as referred to by
some agencies) is a senior management official or executive with the authority to
formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level
of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.8 The authorizing official has
the following responsibilities related to system security plans:

    •    Approves system security plans,

    •    Authorizes operation of an information system,

    •    Issues an interim authorization to operate the information system under specific
         terms and conditions, or

    •    Denies authorization to operate the information system (or if the system is already
         operational, halts operations) if unacceptable security risks exist.


1.8 Rules of Behavior
The rules of behavior, which are required in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and is a
security control contained in NIST SP 800-53, should clearly delineate responsibilities
and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the system. The rules should state
the consequences of inconsistent behavior or noncompliance and be made available to
every user prior to receiving authorization for access to the system. It is required that the
rules contain a signature page for each user to acknowledge receipt, indicating that they
have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior. Electronic signatures
are acceptable for use in acknowledging the rules of behavior.

Figure 2 lists examples from OMB Circular A-130 Appendix III of what should be
covered in typical rules of behavior. These are examples only and agencies have
flexibility in the detail and contents. When developing the rules of behavior, keep in mind
that the intent is to make all users accountable for their actions by acknowledging that
they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior. The rules should
not be a complete copy of the security policy or procedures guide, but rather cover, at a
high level, some of the controls described in the following Figure.

  In some agencies, the senior official and the Chief Information Officer may be co-authorizing officials. In
this situation, the senior official approves the operation of the information system prior to the Chief
Information Officer.

              o Use of copyrighted work

                  accountability

              o Searching databases and divulging information.

1.9 System Security Plan Approval
Organizational policy should clearly define who is responsible for system security plan
approval and procedures developed for plan submission, including any special
memorandum language or other documentation required by the agency. Prior to the
certification and accreditation process, the designated Authorizing Official, independent
from the system owner, typically approves the plan.




                                                                                     8

2. System Boundary Analysis and Security Controls
Before the system security plan can be developed, the information system and the
information resident within that system must be categorized based on a FIPS 199 impact
analysis. Then a determination can be made as to which systems in the inventory can be
logically grouped into major applications or general support systems. The FIPS 199
impact levels must be considered when the system boundaries are drawn and when
selecting the initial set of security controls (i.e., control baseline). The baseline security
controls can then be tailored based on an assessment of risk and local conditions
including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-
benefit analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.
Common security controls, which is one of the tailoring considerations, must be
identified prior to system security plan preparation in order to identity those controls
covered at the agency level, which are not system-specific. These common security
controls can then be incorporated into the system security plan by reference.


2.1 System Boundaries
The process of uniquely assigning information resources9 to an information system
defines the security boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility in
determining what constitutes an information system (i.e., major application or general
support system). If a set of information resources is identified as an information system,
the resources should generally be under the same direct management control. Direct
management control10 does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening
management. It is also possible for an information system to contain multiple
subsystems.

A subsystem is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of
information, information technology, and personnel that perform one or more specific
functions. Subsystems typically fall under the same management authority and are
included within a single system security plan. Figure 3 depicts a general support system
with three subsystems.

In addition to the consideration of direct management control, it may be helpful for
agencies to consider if the information resources being identified as an information
system:

    •   Have the same function or mission objective and essentially the same operating
        characteristics and security needs, and

9
  Information resources consist of information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds,
and information technology.
10
   Direct management control typically involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and
associated responsibility. For new information systems, management control can be interpreted as having
budgetary/programmatic authority and responsibility for the development and deployment of the
information systems. For information systems currently in the federal inventory, management control can
be interpreted as having budgetary/operational authority for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of
the information systems.


                                                                                                     9

   •   Reside in the same general operating environment (or in the case of a distributed
       information system, reside in various locations with similar operating
       environments).

        •     One system security plan reflects information system decomposition with adequate security
              controls assigned to each subsystem component.


            Figure 3: Decomposition of large and complex information systems

While the above considerations may be useful to agencies in determining information
system boundaries for purposes of security accreditation, they should not be viewed as
limiting the agency's flexibility in establishing boundaries that promote effective
information security within the available resources of the agency. Authorizing officials
and senior agency information security officers should consult with prospective
information system owners when establishing information system boundaries. The
process of establishing boundaries for agency information systems and the associated
security implications, is an agency-level activity that should include careful negotiation
among all key participants—taking into account the mission/business requirements of the
agency, the technical considerations with respect to information security, and the
programmatic costs to the agency.

FIPS 199 defines security categories for information systems based on potential impact
on organizations, assets, or individuals should there be a breach of security—that is, a
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS 199 security categories can play an
important part in defining information system boundaries by partitioning the agency's
information systems according to the criticality or sensitivity of the information and
information systems and the importance of those systems in accomplishing the agency's
mission. This is particularly important when there are various FIPS 199 impact levels
contained in one information system. The FIPS 199 requirement to secure an information


                                                                                                          10
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


system to the high watermark or highest impact level must be applied when grouping
minor applications/subsystems with varying FIPS 199 impact levels into a single general
support system or major application unless there is adequate boundary protection, e.g.,
firewalls and encryption, around those subsystems or applications with the highest impact
level. Additionally, there must be assurance that the shared resources, i.e., networks,
communications, and physical access within the whole general support system or major
application, are protected adequately for the highest impact level. Having the ability to
isolate the high impact systems will not only result in more secure systems, but will also
reduce the amount of resources required to secure many applications/systems that do not
require that level of security. NIST SP 800-53 provides three security control baselines,
i.e., low, moderate, and high, that are associated with the three FIPS 199 impact levels; as
the impact level increases, so do the minimum assurance requirements. For reporting
purposes, i.e., FISMA annual report, when an information system has varying FIPS 199
impact levels, that system is categorized at the highest impact level on that information
system.


2.2 Major Applications
All federal applications have value and require some level of protection. Certain
applications, because of the information they contain, process, store, or transmit, or
because of their criticality to the agency's mission, require special management oversight.
These applications are major applications. A major application is expected to have a FIPS
199 impact level of moderate or high. OMB Circular A-130 defines a "major information
system" as an information system that requires special management attention because of
its importance to an agency mission; its high development, operating, or maintenance
costs; or its significant role in the administration of agency programs, finances, property,
or other resources. Major applications are by definition major information systems.

Major applications are systems that perform clearly defined functions for which there are
readily identifiable security considerations and needs (e.g., an electronic funds transfer
system). A major application might comprise many individual programs and hardware,
software, and telecommunications components. These components can be a single
software application or a combination of hardware/software focused on supporting a
specific, mission-related function. A major application may also consist of multiple
individual applications if all are related to a single mission function (e.g., payroll or
personnel). If a system is defined as a major application and the application is run on
another organization's general support system, the major application owner is responsible
for acceptance of risk and in addition:

   •   Notifies the general support system owner that the application is critical and
       provides specific security requirements;

   •   Provides a copy of the major application's system security plan to the operator of
       the general support system;




                                                                                        11
                           Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


       •   Requests a copy of the system security plan of the general support system and
           ensures that it provides adequate protection for the application and information;
           and

       •   Includes a reference to the general support system security plan in the major
           application system security plan.


2.3 General Support Systems
A general support system is an interconnected set of information resources under the
same direct management control that shares common functionality. A general support
system normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications,
communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and/or
applications. A general support system, for example11, can be a:

       •   LAN including smart terminals that support a branch office;
       •   Backbone (e.g., agency-wide);
       •   Communications network;
       •   Agency data processing center including its operating system and utilities,
       •   Tactical radio network; or
       •   Shared information processing service facility

A general support system can have a FIPS 199 impact level of low, moderate, or high in
its security categorization depending on the criticality or sensitivity of the system and any
major applications the general support system is supporting. A general support system is
considered a major information system when special management attention is required,
there are high development, operating, or maintenance costs; and the system/information
has a significant role in the administration of agency programs. When the general support
system is a major information system, the system's FIPS 199 impact level is either
moderate or high.

A major application can be hosted on a general support system. The general support
system plan should reference the major application system security plan.


2.4 Minor Applications
Agencies are expected to exercise management judgment in determining which of their
applications are minor applications and to ensure that the security requirements of minor
applications are addressed as part of the system security plan for the applicable general
support systems or, in some cases, the applicable major application. It is very common
that a minor application may have a majority of its security controls provided by the
general support system or major application on which it resides. If this is the case, the
information system owner of the general support system or major application is the
information system owner for the minor application and is responsible for developing the

                                                                                                         12
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


system security plan. The additional security controls specific to the minor application
should be documented in the system security plan as an appendix or paragraph. The
minor application owner (often the same as information owner) may develop the
appendix or paragraph describing the additional controls. The complete general support
system or major application system security plan should be shared with the information
owner.

The minor application can have a FIPS 199 security category of low or moderate.
However, if the minor application resides on a system that does not have adequate
boundary protection, the minor application must implement the minimum baseline
controls required by the host or interconnected system.


2.5 Security Controls
FIPS 200 provides seventeen minimum security requirements for federal information and
information systems. The requirements represent a broad-based, balanced information
security program that addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of
protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information and
information systems. An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in this
standard by applying security controls selected in accordance with NIST SP 800-53 and
the designated impact levels of the information systems. An agency has the flexibility to
tailor the security control baseline in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
in the standard. Tailoring activities include: (i) the application of scoping guidance; (ii)
the specification of compensating controls; and (iii) the specification of agency-defined
parameters in the security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should
document all tailoring activities.

2.5.1 Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides an agency with specific terms and conditions on the
applicability and implementation of individual security controls in the security control
baselines defined in NIST SP 800-53. Several considerations described below can
potentially impact how the baseline security controls are applied by the agency. System
security plans should clearly identify which security controls employed scoping guidance
and include a description of the type of considerations that were made. The application
of scoping guidance must be reviewed and approved by the authorizing official for the
information system.

Technology-related considerations—

   -   Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography,
       public key infrastructure) will only be applicable if those technologies are
       employed or are required to be employed within the information system.

   -   Security controls will only be applicable to those components of the information
       system that typically provide the security capability addressed by the minimum
       security requirements.


                                                                                      13
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems



-        Security controls that can be either explicitly or implicitly supported by
         automated mechanisms will not require the development of such mechanisms if
         the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or
         government off-the-shelf products. In situations where automated mechanisms
         are not readily available or technically feasible, compensating security controls,
         implemented through non-automated mechanisms or procedures, will be used to
         satisfy minimum security requirements.

Common security control-related considerations—

-        Security controls designated by the agency as common controls will, in most
         cases, be managed by an organizational entity other than the information system
         owner. Every control in a security control baseline must be addressed either by
         the agency through common security controls or by the information system
         owner. Decisions on common control designations must not, however, affect the
         agency's responsibility in providing the necessary security controls required to
         meet the minimum security requirements for the information system. (Additional
         information on common controls is provided in Section 2.5.3.)

Public access information systems-related considerations—

-        Security controls associated with public access information systems must be
         carefully considered and applied with discretion since some of the security
         controls from the specified security control baselines (e.g., personnel security
         controls, identification and authentication controls) may not be applicable to users
         accessing information systems through public interfaces.12

Infrastructure-related considerations—

-        Security controls that refer to agency facilities (e.g., physical access controls such
         as locks and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting,
         fire, and power) will be applicable only to those sections of the facilities that
         directly provide protection to, support for, or are related to the information system
         (including its information technology assets such as electronic mail or web
         servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, controlled interface
         equipment, and communications equipment).



12
  For example, while the baseline security controls require identification and authentication of
organizational personnel who maintain and support information systems that provide public access
services, the same controls might not be required for users accessing those systems through public
interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other hand, identification and authentication
must be required for users accessing information systems through public interfaces to access their
private/personal information.



                                                                                                     14
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


Scalability-related considerations—

-        Security controls will be scalable by the size and complexity of the particular
         agency implementing the controls and the impact level of the information system.
         Scalability addresses the breadth and depth of security control implementation.
         Discretion is needed in scaling the security controls to the particular environment
         of use to ensure a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control
         implementation.13

Risk-related considerations—

-        Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or
         availability security objectives can be downgraded to the corresponding control in
         a lower baseline (or appropriately modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower
         baseline) if, and only if, the downgrading action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS
         199 security categorization for the corresponding security objectives of
         confidentiality, integrity, or availability before moving to the high watermark;14
         (ii) is supported by an agency’s assessment of risk; and (iii) does not affect the
         security-relevant information within the information system.15

2.5.2 Compensating Controls
Compensating security controls are the management, operational, or technical controls
employed by an agency in lieu of prescribed controls in the low, moderate, or high
security control baselines, which provide equivalent or comparable protection for an
information system. Compensating security controls for an information system will be
employed by an agency only under the following conditions: (i) the agency selects the
compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST SP 800-53; (ii) the
agency provides a complete and convincing rationale and justification for how the
compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection for
the information system; and (iii) the agency assesses and formally accepts the risk
associated with employing the compensating controls in the information system. The use


13
   For example, a contingency plan for a large and complex organization with a moderate-impact or high-
impact information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of implementation detail.
In contrast, a contingency plan for a smaller organization with a low-impact information system may be
considerably shorter and contain much less implementation detail.
14
   When employing the “high watermark” concept, some of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality,
integrity, or availability) may have been increased to a higher impact level. As such, the security controls
that uniquely support these security objectives will have been upgraded as well. Consequently,
organizations must consider appropriate and allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-
based application of security controls.
15
   Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables,
cryptographic key management information) must be distinguished from user-level information within an
information system. Certain security controls within an information system are used to support the security
objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Organizations
must exercise caution in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the
downgrading action does not affect the security-relevant information within the information system.



                                                                                                      15
                   Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


of compensating security controls must be reviewed, documented in the system security
plan, and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

2.5.3 Common Security Controls
An agency-wide view of the information security program facilitates the identification of
common security controls that can be applied to one or more agency information systems.
Common security controls can apply to: (i) all agency information systems; (ii) a group
of information systems at a specific site (sometimes associated with the terms site
certification/accreditation); or (iii) common information systems, subsystems, or
applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple
operational sites (sometimes associated with the terms type certification/accreditation).
Common security controls, typically identified during a collaborative agency-wide
process with the involvement of the CIO, SAISO, authorizing officials, information
system owners, and information system security officers (and by developmental program
managers in the case of common security controls for common hardware, software,
and/or firmware), have the following properties:

   •   The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls
       can be assigned to responsible agency officials or organizational elements (other
       than the information system owners whose systems will implement or use those
       common security controls); and

   •   The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to
       support the security certification and accreditation processes of agency
       information systems where those controls have been applied.

Many of the management and operational controls (e.g., contingency planning controls,
incident response controls, security awareness and training controls, personnel security
controls, and physical security controls) needed to protect an information system may be
excellent candidates for common security control status. The objective is to reduce
security costs by centrally managing the development, implementation, and assessment of
the common security controls designated by the agency—and subsequently, sharing
assessment results with the owners of information systems where those common security
controls are applied. Security controls not designated as common controls are considered
system-specific controls and are the responsibility of the information system owner.
System security plans should clearly identify which security controls have been
designated as common security controls and which controls have been designated as
system-specific controls.

For efficiency in developing system security plans, common security controls should be
documented once and then inserted or imported into each system security plan for the
information systems within the agency. The individual responsible for implementing the
common control should be listed in the security plan. Effectively maximizing the
application of common controls in the system security planning process depends upon the
following factors:



                                                                                   16
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


   •   The agency has developed, documented, and communicated its specific guidance
       on identifying common security controls;

   •   The agency has assigned the responsibility for coordinating common security
       control identification and review and obtaining consensus on the common control
       designations, to a management official with security program responsibilities such
       as the CIO or SAISO;

   •   System owners have been briefed on the system security planning process
       including use of common controls; and

   •   Agency experts in the common control areas identified have been consulted as
       part of the process.

An agency may also assign a hybrid status to security controls in situations where one
part of the control is deemed to be common, while another part of the control is deemed
to be system-specific. For example, an agency may view the IR-1 (Incident Response
Policy and Procedures) security control as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the
control deemed to be common and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be
system-specific. Hybrid security controls may also serve as templates for further control
refinement. An agency may choose, for example, to implement the CP-2 (Contingency
Plan) security control as a master template for a generalized contingency plan for all
agency information systems with individual information system owners tailoring the
plan, where appropriate, for system-specific issues.

Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific issues associated with
the implementation of an agency's common security controls. These issues are identified
and described in the system security plans for the individual information systems. The
SAISO, acting on behalf of the CIO, should coordinate with agency officials (e.g.,
facilities managers, site managers, personnel managers) responsible for the development
and implementation of the designated common security controls to ensure that the
required controls are put into place, the controls are assessed, and the assessment results
are shared with the appropriate information system owners.

Partitioning security controls into common security controls and system-specific security
controls can result in significant savings to the agency in control development and
implementation costs. It can also result in a more consistent application of the security
controls across the agency at large. Moreover, equally significant savings can be realized
in the security certification and accreditation process. Rather than assessing common
security controls in every information system, the certification process draws upon any
applicable results from the most current assessment of the common security controls
performed at the agency level. An agency-wide approach to reuse and sharing of
assessment results can greatly enhance the efficiency of the security certifications and
accreditations being conducted by an agency and significantly reduce security program
costs.



                                                                                     17
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls and
system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this principle
within an agency takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an agency is just
beginning to implement this approach or has only partially implemented this approach, it
may take some time to get the maximum benefits from security control partitioning and
the associated reuse of assessment evidence. Because of the potential dependence on
common security controls by many of an agency's information systems, a failure of such
common controls may result in a significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that
arises from the operation of the systems that depend on these controls.

3. Plan Development
The remainder of this document guides the reader in writing a system security plan,
including logical steps which should be followed in approaching plan development,
recommended structure and content, and how to maximize the use of current NIST
publications to effectively support system security planning activity. There should be
established agency policy on how the information system security plans are to be
controlled and accessed prior to initiation of the activity.


3.1 System Name and Identifier
The first item listed in the system security plan is the system name and identifier. As
required in OMB Circular A-11, each system should be assigned a name and unique
identifier. Assignment of a unique identifier supports the agency's ability to easily collect
agency information and security metrics specific to the system as well as facilitate
complete traceability to all requirements related to system implementation and
performance. This identifier should remain the same throughout the life of the system
and be retained in audit logs related to system use.


3.2 System Categorization
Each system identified in the agency's system inventory must be categorized using FIPS
199. NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and
Information Systems to Security Categories, provides implementation guidance in
completing this activity. See Table 1 for a summary of FIPS 199 categories.


3.3 System Owner
A designated system owner must be identified in the system security plan for each
system. This person is the key point of contact (POC) for the system and is responsible
for coordinating system development life cycle (SDLC) activities specific to the system.
It is important that this person have expert knowledge of the system capabilities and
functionality. The assignment of a system owner should be documented in writing and
the plan should include the following contact information:

   •   Name
   •   Title
   •   Agency
   •   Address
   •   Phone Number
   •   Email Address

3.4 Authorizing Official
An authorizing official must be identified in the system security plan for each system.
This person is the senior management official who has the authority to authorize
operation (accredit) of an information system (major application or general support
system) and accept the residual risk associated with the system. The assignment of the
authorizing official should be in writing, and the plan must include the same contact
information listed in Section 3.3.


3.5 Other Designated Contacts
This section should include names of other key contact personnel who can address
inquiries regarding system characteristics and operation. The same information listed in
Section 3.3 should be included for each person listed under this section.



                                                                                                               20
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


3.6 Assignment of Security Responsibility
Within an agency, an individual must be assigned responsibility for each system. This
can be accomplished in many ways. In some agencies, the overall responsibility may be
delegated to the SAISO. Often, the SAISO is supported by a subnet of security officers
assigned to each major component. These security officers may be authorized to address
the security requirements for all systems within their domain of authority. Other models
may segment this responsibility in other ways based on agency structure and
responsibility. The same contact information, as listed under Section 3.3, should be
provided for these individuals. Most important is that this responsibility be formalized in
writing either in the employee's Position Description or by delegation Memorandum.


3.7 System Operational Status
Indicate one or more of the following for the system's operational status. If more than
one status is selected, list which part of the system is covered under each status.

   •   Operational — the system is in production.
   •   Under Development — the system is being designed, developed, or implemented.
   •   Undergoing a major modification — the system is undergoing a major conversion
       or transition.

If the system is under development or undergoing a major modification, provide
information about the methods used to assure that up-front security requirements are
included. Include specific controls in the appropriate sections of the plan depending on
where the system is in the security life cycle.


3.8 Information System Type
In this section of the plan, indicate whether the system is a major application or general
support system. If the system contains minor applications, describe them in the General
Description/Purpose section of the plan. If the agency has additional categories of
information system types, modify the template to include the other categories.


3.9 General Description/Purpose
Prepare a brief description (one to three paragraphs) of the function and purpose of the
system (e.g., economic indicator, network support for an agency, business census data
analysis, crop reporting support).

If the system is a general support system, list all applications supported by the general
support system. Specify if the application is or is not a major application and include
unique name/identifiers, where applicable. Describe each application's function and the
information processed. Include a list of user organizations, whether they are internal or
external to the system owner's agency.




                                                                                     21
                      Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


3.10 System Environment
Provide a brief (one to three paragraphs) general description of the technical system.
Include any environmental or technical factors that raise special security concerns, such
as use of Personal Digital Assistants, wireless technology, etc. Typically, operational
environments are as follows:

     •   Standalone or Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) describes small, informal
         computer installations that are used for home or business purposes. Standalone
         encompasses a variety of small-scale environments and devices, ranging from
         laptops, mobile devices, or home computers, to telecommuting systems, to small
         businesses and small branch offices of a company.

     •   Managed or Enterprise are typically large agency systems with defined,
         organized suites of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of
         centrally managed workstations and servers protected from the Internet by
         firewalls and other network security devices.

     •   Custom environments contain systems in which the functionality and degree of
         security do not fit the other environments. Two typical Custom environments are
         Specialized Security-Limited Functionality and Legacy:

            -- Specialized Security-Limited Functionality. A Specialized Security-
            Limited Functionality environment contains systems and networks at high risk
            of attack or data exposure, with security taking precedence over functionality.
            It assumes systems have limited or specialized (not general purpose
            workstations or systems) functionality in a highly threatened environment
            such as an outward facing firewall or public web server or whose data content
            or mission purpose is of such value that aggressive trade-offs in favor of
            security outweigh the potential negative consequences to other useful system
            attributes such as legacy applications or interoperability with other systems.
            A Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment could be a subset
            of another environment.

            -- Legacy. A Legacy environment contains older systems or applications that
            may use older, less-secure communication mechanisms. Other machines
            operating in a Legacy environment may need less restrictive security settings
            so that they can communicate with legacy systems and applications. A
            Legacy environment could be a subset of a standalone or managed
            environment.16

Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products -- Guidance for Checklists Users and Developers.


                                                                                               22
                   Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


3.11 System Interconnection/Information Sharing
System interconnection is the direct connection of two or more IT systems for the
purpose of sharing information resources. System interconnection, if not appropriately
protected, may result in a compromise of all connected systems and the data they store,
process, or transmit. It is important that system owners, information owners, and
management obtain as much information as possible regarding vulnerabilities associated
with system interconnections and information sharing. This is essential to selecting the
appropriate controls required to mitigate those vulnerabilities. An Interconnection
Security Agreement (ISA), Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), or Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) is needed between systems (not between workstations/desktops or
publicly accessed systems) that share data that are owned or operated by different
organizations. An ISA is not needed with internal agency systems if an agency manages
and enforces a rigid system development life cycle, which requires approvals and sign-
offs ensuring compliance with security requirements. For additional information on
interconnections, see NIST SP 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information
Technology Systems.

In this section, for each interconnection between systems that are owned or operated by
different organizations, provide the following information concerning the authorization
for the connection to other systems or the sharing of information:

   •   Name of system;

   •   Organization;

   •   Type of interconnection (Internet, Dial-Up, etc.);

   •   Authorizations for interconnection (MOU/MOA, ISA);

   •   Date of agreement;

   •    FIPS 199 Category;

   •   Certification and accreditation status of system; and

   •   Name and title of authorizing official(s).

For agencies with numerous interconnections, a table format including the above
information may be a good way to present the information.


3.12 Laws, Regulations, and Policies Affecting the System
List any laws, regulations, or policies that establish specific requirements for
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and information retained by,
transmitted by, or processed by the system. General agency security requirements need



                                                                                   23
                      Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


not be listed since they mandate security for all systems. Each agency should decide on
the level of laws, regulations, and policies to include in the system security plan.
Examples might include the Privacy Act of 1974 or a specific statute or regulation
concerning the information processed (e.g., tax or census information). If the system
processes records subject to the Privacy Act, include the number and title of the Privacy
Act system(s) of records and whether the system(s) are used for computer matching
activities.


3.13 Security Control Selection
In preparation for documenting how the NIST SP 800-53 security controls for the
applicable security control baseline (low-, moderate-, or high impact information
systems) are implemented or planned to be implemented, the security controls contained
in the baseline should be reviewed and possibly tailored. The scoping guidelines
explained in Section 2.5.1 should be used when determining the applicability or tailoring
of individual controls. Additionally the controls that are common among numerous
systems or within the whole agency should be identified and then documented in the
plan. See Section 2.5.3 for guidance on how the common controls should be determined,
documented, and coordinated. The process of selecting the appropriate security controls
and applying the scoping guidelines to achieve adequate security17 is a multifaceted, risk-
based activity involving management and operational personnel within the agency and
should be conducted before the security control portion of the plan is written.

-       For low-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum, employ the
        security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
        800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with
        the low baseline are satisfied.

-       For moderate-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum,
        employ the security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
        defined in NIST SP 800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance
        requirements associated with the moderate baseline are satisfied.

-       For high-impact information systems, an agency must, as a minimum, employ the
        security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
        800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with
        the high baseline are satisfied.


3.14 Minimum Security Controls
Now that the security controls have been selected, tailored, and the common controls
identified, describe each control. The description should contain 1) the security control
title; 2) how the security control is being implemented or planned to be implemented; 3)
17
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines adequate security
as security commensurate with the risk and the magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
unauthorized access to or modification of information.


                                                                                              24
                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


any scoping guidance that has been applied and what type of consideration; and 4)
indicate if the security control is a common control and who is responsible for its
implementation.

Security controls in the security control catalog (NIST SP 800-53, Appendix F) have a
well-defined organization and structure. The security controls are organized into classes
and families for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. There are
three general classes of security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical18).
Each family contains security controls related to the security function of the family. A
standardized, two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family.
Table 2 summarizes the classes and families in the security control catalog and the
associated family identifiers.

Security control class designations (i.e., management, operational, and technical) are
defined below for clarification in preparation of system security plans.
Management controls focus on the management of the information system and the
management of risk for a system. They are techniques and concerns that are normally
addressed by management. Operational controls address security methods focusing on
18
  Security control families in NIST SP 800-53 are associated with one of three security control classes (i.e.,
management, operational, technical). Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the
dominant characteristics of the controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically
associated with more than one class. For example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the
Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational control but also has characteristics that are
consistent with security management as well.



                                                                                                      25
                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


mechanisms primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems).
These controls are put in place to improve the security of a particular system (or group of
systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and often rely upon
management activities as well as technical controls. Technical controls focus on security
controls that the computer system executes. The controls can provide automated
protection for unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of security violations,
and support security requirements for applications and data.

The completion date of the system security plan should be provided. The completion date
should be updated whenever the plan is periodically reviewed and updated. When the
system is updated, a version number should be added. The system security plan should
also contain the date the authorizing official or the designated approving authority
approved the plan. Approval documentation, i.e., accreditation letter, approval
memorandum, should be on file or attached as part of the plan.


3.16 Ongoing System Security Plan Maintenance
Once the information system security plan is developed, it is important to periodically
assess the plan, review any change in system status, functionality, design, etc., and ensure
that the plan continues to reflect the correct information about the system. This
documentation and its correctness are critical for system certification activity. All plans
should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include
in the review are:

   •   Change in information system owner;
   •   Change in information security representative;
   •   Change in system architecture;
   •   Change in system status;
   •   Additions/deletions of system interconnections;
   •   Change in system scope;
   •   Change in authorizing official; and
   •   Change in certification and accreditation status.
