This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) of 2002, P.L. 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency
operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security
systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is
provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor
should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the
Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies
in implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and in
managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are developed by NIST in accordance
          with FISMA. FIPS are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with
          these standards, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Guidance documents and recommendations are issued in the NIST Special Publication
          (SP) 800-series. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies (including OMB
          FISMA Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and
          Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs and
          systems, agencies must follow NIST guidance. 1
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency and internal reports (NISTIRs),
          and ITL Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities.
          These publications are mandatory only when so specified by OMB.

                   Schedule for Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines
     •    For legacy information systems, agencies are expected to be in compliance with NIST
          security standards and guidelines within one year of the publication date unless otherwise
          directed by OMB or NIST. 2
     •    For information systems under development, agencies are expected to be in compliance
          with NIST security standards and guidelines immediately upon deployment of the
          system.




1
  While agencies are required to follow NIST guidance in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility within
NIST’s guidance in how agencies apply the guidance. Unless otherwise specified by OMB, the 800-series guidance
documents published by NIST generally allow agencies some latitude in their application. Consequently, the
application of NIST guidance by agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable,
compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems.
When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, evaluators, and/or assessors should consider the
intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the particular guidance document and how the agency
applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission responsibilities, operational environments, and unique
organizational conditions.
2
 The one-year compliance date for revisions to NIST Special Publications applies only to the new and/or updated
material in the publications resulting from the periodic revision process. Agencies are expected to be in compliance
with previous versions of NIST Special Publications within one year of the publication date of the previous versions.

                          FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT
                                IMPLEMENTING SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

    FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, is a
    mandatory, non-waiverable standard developed in response to the Federal Information Security
    Management Act of 2002. To comply with the federal standard, agencies must first determine the
    security category of their information system in accordance with the provisions of FIPS 199,
    Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and then
    apply the appropriate set of baseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as
    amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Agencies have
    flexibility in applying the baseline security controls in accordance with the tailoring guidance
    provided in Special Publication 800-53. This allows agencies to adjust the security controls to
    more closely fit their mission requirements and operational environments.
    The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires a foundational level of
    security for all federal information and information systems. The agency's risk assessment
    validates the security control set and determines if any additional controls are needed to protect
    agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals,
    other organizations, or the Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of
    “security due diligence” for the federal agency and its contractors.
    In addition to the security requirements established by FISMA, there may also be specific security
    requirements in different business areas within agencies that are governed by other laws, Executive
    Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or associated governing documents, (e.g., the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Federal Financial Management
    Improvement Act of 1996, or OMB Circular A-127 on Financial Management Systems). These
    requirements may not be equivalent to the security requirements and implementing security
    controls required by FISMA or may enhance or further refine the security requirements and security
    controls. It is important that agency officials (including authorizing officials, chief information
    officers, senior agency information security officers, information system owners, information
    system security officers, and acquisition authorities) take steps to ensure that: (i) all appropriate
    security requirements are addressed in agency acquisitions of information systems and information
    system services; and (ii) all required security controls are implemented in agency information
    systems. See http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert/ca-compliance.html for additional information on FISMA
    compliance.

                    DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                            COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

  In developing standards and guidelines required by the Federal Information Security Management Act
  (FISMA), NIST consults with other federal agencies and offices as well as the private sector to improve
  information security, avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST standards
  and guidelines are complementary with standards and guidelines employed for the protection of
  national security systems. In addition to its comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is
  working with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense
  (DOD), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for
  information security across the federal government. The common foundation for information security
  will provide the Intelligence, Defense, and Civil sectors of the federal government and their support
  contractors, more uniform and consistent ways to manage the risk to organizational operations,
  organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from the operation and use of
  information systems. NIST is also working with public and private sector entities to establish specific
  mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST in the
  FISMA Implementation Project and the International Organization for Standardization and International
  Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27000-series standards.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR SECURITY CONTROLS TO PROTECT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

       he selection and employment of appropriate security controls for an information system 3

T      are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations 4 and assets of an
       organization as well as the welfare of individuals. Security controls are the management,
operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. There are
several important questions that should be answered by organizational officials when addressing
the security considerations for their information systems:
•      What security controls are needed to adequately protect the information systems that support
       the operations and assets of the organization in order for that organization to accomplish its
       assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day
       functions, and protect individuals?
•      Have the selected security controls been implemented or is there a realistic plan for their
       implementation?
•      What is the desired or required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the
       selected security controls, as implemented, are effective 5 in their application?

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
information security program for the organization that identifies, controls, and mitigates risks to
its information and information systems. 6 The security controls defined in Special Publication
800-53 (as amended) and recommended for use by organizations in protecting their information
systems should be employed in conjunction with and as part of a well-defined and documented
information security program. An effective information security program should include:
•      Periodic assessments of risk, including the magnitude of harm that could result from the
       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information
       and information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization;
•      Policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments, cost-effectively reduce
       information security risks to an acceptable level and address information security throughout
       the life cycle of each organizational information system;

3
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and
environmental control systems.
4
    Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.
5
  Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information
system in its operational environment.
6
  The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347), passed by the one hundred and seventh Congress and signed into law by the
President in December 2002, recognized the importance of information security to the economic and national security
interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                        PAGE 1
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, information
     systems, or groups of information systems, as appropriate;
•    Security awareness training to inform personnel (including contractors and other users of
     information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization) of the
     information security risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in
     complying with organizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks;
•    Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies,
     procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on
     risk, but no less than annually;
•    A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to
     address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the
     organization;
•    Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and
•    Plans and procedures for continuity of operations for information systems that support the
     operations and assets of the organization.

It is of paramount importance that responsible officials within the organization understand the
risks and other factors that could adversely affect organizational operations, organizational assets,
or individuals. Moreover, these officials must understand the current status of their security
programs and the security controls planned or in place to protect their information systems in
order to make informed judgments and investments that appropriately mitigate risks to an
acceptable level. The ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the
organization and to accomplish the organization’s stated mission(s) with what the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 defines as adequate security, or security
commensurate with risk, including the magnitude of harm to individuals, the organization, or its
assets resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines apply to all components 7 of an information system that process, store, or transmit
federal information. The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure
information systems within the federal government by:
•    Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
     specifying security controls for information systems;
•    Providing a recommendation for minimum security controls for information systems
     categorized in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199,
     Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems;

7
 Information system components include, but are not limited to, mainframes, servers, workstations, network
components, operating systems, middleware, and applications. Network components can include, for example, such
devices as firewalls, sensors (local or remote), switches, guards, routers, gateways, wireless access points, and network
appliances. Servers can include, for example, database servers, authentication servers, electronic mail and web servers,
proxy servers, domain name servers, and network time servers. Information system components are either purchased
commercially off-the-shelf or are custom-developed and can be deployed in land-based, sea-based, airborne, and/or
space-based information systems.



CHAPTER 1                                                                                                         PAGE 2
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls for information systems to meet
     current organizational protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on
     changing requirements and technologies; and
•    Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
     determining security control effectiveness.

The guidelines provided in this special publication are applicable to all federal information
systems 8 other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44
U.S.C., Section 3542. 9 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective
to complement similar guidelines for national security systems. This publication is intended to
provide guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems. In addition to the agencies of the federal
government, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations that compose
the critical infrastructure of the United States, are encouraged to use these guidelines, as
appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse federal audience of information system and
information security professionals including: (i) individuals with information system and
information security management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., chief information officers,
senior agency information security officers, and authorizing officials); (ii) individuals with
information system development responsibilities (e.g., program and project managers,
mission/application owners, system designers, system and application programmers); (iii)
individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
information system owners, information owners, information system administrators, information
system security officers,); and (iv) individuals with information system and information security
assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, inspectors general, evaluators, and
certification agents). Commercial companies producing information technology products and
systems, creating information security-related technologies, and providing information security
services can also benefit from the information in this publication.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create the most technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for
information systems, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this special
publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial, healthcare,
and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by national and international standards
organizations. 10 The objective of NIST Special Publication 800-53 is to provide a set of security

controls that is sufficiently rich to satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements 11 levied
on information systems and that is consistent with and complementary to other established
security standards.

The catalog of security controls provided in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to
demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security
requirements. It is the responsibility of organizations to select the appropriate security controls,
to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in
satisfying their stated security requirements. The security controls in the catalog facilitate the
development of assessment methods and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control
effectiveness in a consistent and repeatable manner—thus contributing to the organization’s
confidence that there is ongoing compliance with its stated security requirements. 12

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations 13 should use FIPS 199 to define security categories for their information systems.
This publication associates recommended minimum security controls with FIPS 199 low-impact,
moderate-impact, and high-impact security categories. For each information system, the
recommendation for minimum security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (i.e., the
baseline security controls defined in Appendix D, tailored in accordance with the tailoring
guidance in Section 3.3) is intended to be used as a starting point for and input to the
organization’s risk assessment process. 14 The risk assessment results are used to supplement the
tailored baseline resulting in a set of agreed-upon controls documented in the security plan for the
information system. While the FIPS 199 security categorization associates the operation of the
information system with the potential impact on an organization’s operations, assets, or
individuals, the incorporation of refined threat and vulnerability information during the risk
assessment facilitates supplementing the tailored baseline security controls to address
organizational needs and tolerance for risk. The final, agreed-upon set of security controls should
be documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system. 15

The use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 and the incorporation of tailored
baseline controls as a starting point in the control selection process, facilitates a more consistent
level of security across federal information systems. It also offers the needed flexibility to

11
   Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.
12
   NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
(Second Public Draft), April 2006, provides guidance on assessment methods and procedures for security controls
defined in this publication. Special Publication 800-53A can also be used to conduct self-assessments of information
systems.
13
   An organization typically exercises direct managerial, operational, and/or financial control over its information
systems and the security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement the appropriate
security controls necessary to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.
14
   Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the organization. The
assessment of risk is a process that should be incorporated into the system development life cycle. NIST Special
Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on the
assessment and mitigation of risk as part of an overall risk management process.
15
  NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, provides
guidance on documenting information system security controls. The general guidance in Special Publication 800-18 is
augmented by Special Publication 800-53 with recommendations for information and rationale to be included in the
system security plan.

appropriately modify the controls based on specific organizational policy and requirements,
particular conditions and circumstances, known threat and vulnerability information, and
tolerance for risk to the organization’s operations, assets, or to individuals.

Building a more secure information system is a multifaceted undertaking that involves the use of:
(i) well-defined system-level security requirements and security specifications; (ii) well-designed
information technology products; (iii) sound systems/security engineering principles and
practices to effectively integrate information technology products into the information system;
(iv) appropriate methods for product/system testing and evaluation; and (v) comprehensive
system security planning and life cycle management. 16 From a systems engineering viewpoint,
security is just one of many required capabilities for an organizational information system—
capabilities that must be funded by the organization throughout the life cycle of the system.
Realistically assessing the risks to an organization’s operations and assets or to individuals by
placing the information system into operation or continuing its operation is of utmost importance.
Addressing the information system security requirements must be accomplished with full
consideration of the risk tolerance of the organization in light of the potential impacts, cost,
schedule, and performance issues associated with the acquisition, deployment, and operation of
the system.

CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE




T     his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
      and specification including: (i) the structure of security controls and the organization of the
      controls in the control catalog; (ii) security control baselines; (iii) the identification and use
of common security controls; (iv) security controls in external environments; (v) security control
assurance; and (vi) future revisions to the security controls, the control catalog, and baseline
controls.

2.1 SECURITY CONTROL ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
Security controls in the security control catalog (Appendix F) have a well-defined organization
and structure. The security controls are organized into classes and families for ease of use in the
control selection and specification process. There are three general classes of security controls
(i.e., management, operational, and technical) and seventeen security control families. 17 Each
family contains security controls related to the security functionality of the family. A two-
character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. Table 1 summarizes the
classes and families in the security control catalog and the associated family identifiers.

17
   The seventeen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are closely aligned with the seventeen
security-related areas in FIPS 200 specifying the minimum security requirements for protecting federal information and
information systems. Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant characteristics of the
controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more than one class. For
example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational
control but also has characteristics that are consistent with security management as well.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                      PAGE 6
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


To uniquely identify each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to
indicate the number of the control within the control family. For example, CP-9 is the ninth
control in the Contingency Planning family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. 18 The following
example from the Auditing and Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security
control.
AU-2      AUDITABLE EVENTS

          Control: The information system generates audit records for the following events: [Assignment:
          organization-defined auditable events].
          Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to identify important events which need to be
          audited as significant and relevant to the security of the information system. The organization
          specifies which information system components carry out auditing activities. Auditing activity
          can affect information system performance. Therefore, the organization decides, based upon a risk
          assessment, which events require auditing on a continuous basis and which events require auditing
          in response to specific situations. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
          including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of
          abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate
          the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is
          coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual support
          between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each function. The
          checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended lists
          of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events that are adequate to support after-
          the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance
          on computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to compile audit records from multiple components
                throughout the system into a systemwide (logical or physical), time-correlated audit trail.
          (2)   The information system provides the capability to manage the selection of events to be audited by
                individual components of the system.
          (3)   The organization periodically reviews and updates the list of organization-defined auditable events.


            LOW AU-2                     MOD AU-2 (3)                  HIGH AU-2 (1) (2) (3)


The control section provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to
protect a particular aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific
security-related activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information
system. For some controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing
organizations to selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the
controls. This flexibility is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations
within the main body of the control. Assignment and selection operations provide an opportunity
for an organization to tailor the security controls to support specific mission, business, or
operational needs. For example, an organization can specify the specific events to be audited.
Once specified, the organization-defined value becomes part of the control, and the organization
is assessed against the completed control statement. Some assignment operations may specify
minimum or maximum values that constrain the values that may be input by the organization.

18
   A supplemental guidance section is also used for security control enhancements in situations where the guidance is
not generally applicable to the entire control but instead focused on the particular control enhancement.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                        PAGE 7
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Selection statements also narrow the potential input values by providing a specific list of items
from which the organization must choose.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations are expected to apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, when
defining, developing, and implementing security controls. In certain instances, the supplemental
guidance provides more detail concerning the control requirements or important considerations
(and the needed flexibility) for implementing security controls in the context of an organization’s
operational environment, specific mission requirements, or assessment of risk. In addition,
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST Special Publications) are listed in the
supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the particular security control.

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a
basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control. In the example above, if all three control enhancements
are selected, the control designation subsequently becomes AU-2 (1) (2) (3). The numerical
designation of a security control enhancement is used only to identify a particular enhancement
within the control structure. The designation is neither indicative of the relative strength of the
control enhancement nor assumes any hierarchical relationship among enhancements. In the
above example, enhancement (3) is used before (1) and (2) since that enhancement is appropriate
at a lower level than the other two. This type of situation arises from the decision to enhance
control stability in the face of change by not renumbering existing enhancements when new ones
are added or when decisions about placement within baselines change.

2.2 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations are required to employ security controls to meet security requirements defined by
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., Federal
Information Security Management Act, OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III). The challenge for
organizations is to determine the appropriate set of security controls, which if implemented and
determined to be effective in their application, would most cost-effectively comply with the stated
security requirements. 19 Selecting the appropriate set of security controls to meet the specific,
and sometimes unique, security requirements of an organization is an important task—a task that
demonstrates the organization’s commitment to security and the due diligence exercised in
protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and information
systems.

To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for their
information systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the
minimum security controls recommended for an information system based on the system’s


19
   An information system may require security controls at different layers within the system. For example, an operating
system or network component typically provides an identification and authentication capability. An application may
also provide its own identification and authentication capability rendering an additional level of protection for the
overall information system. The selection and specification of security controls should consider components at all
layers within the information system as part of effective security and privacy architectures.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 8
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                  Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


security categorization in accordance with FIPS 199. 20 The tailored security control baseline
(i.e., the appropriate control baseline from Appendix D tailored in accordance with the guidance
in Section 3.3) serves as the starting point for organizations in determining the appropriate
safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect their information systems. Because the
baselines are intended to be broadly applicable starting points, supplements to the tailored
baselines (see Section 3.4) will likely be necessary in order to achieve adequate risk mitigation.
The tailored baselines are supplemented based on organizational assessments of risk and the
resulting controls documented in the security plans for the information systems.

Appendix D provides a listing of baseline security controls. Three sets of baseline controls have
been identified corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact levels
defined in the security categorization process in FIPS 199 and derived in Section 3.2. Each of the
three baselines provides an initial set of security controls for a particular impact level associated
with a security category. 21 Appendix F provides the complete catalog of security controls for
information systems, arranged by control families. The catalog represents the entire set of
security controls defined at this time. Chapter 3 provides additional information on how to use
security categories to select the appropriate set of baseline security controls, how to apply the
tailoring guidance to the baseline controls, and how to supplement the tailored baseline in order to
achieve adequate risk mitigation.


                                                  Implementation Tip
     Since the baseline security controls represent the minimum controls for low-impact, moderate-impact,
     and high-impact information systems, respectively, there are additional controls and control
     enhancements that appear in the catalog that are found in only higher-impact baselines or not used in
     any of the baselines. These additional security controls and control enhancements for the information
     system are available to organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to
     achieve the needed level of protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk.
     Moreover, security controls and control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be
     used by organizations to strengthen the level of protection provided in lower-level baselines, if deemed
     appropriate. At the end of the security control selection and specification process, the agreed-upon set
     of security controls documented in the security plan, must be sufficient to provide adequate security for
     the organization and mitigate risks to its operations, assets, and individuals.




2.3 COMMON SECURITY CONTROLS
An organization-wide view of an information security program facilitates the identification of
common security controls that can be applied to one or more organizational information systems.
Common security controls can apply to: (i) all organizational information systems; (ii) a group of
information systems at a specific site; or (iii) common information systems, subsystems, or
applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational
sites. Common security controls have the following properties:



20
  FIPS 199 security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization or individuals should certain events
occur which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned
mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.
21
  The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the tailoring guidance
described in Section 3.3 provides the organization the ability to eliminate certain controls or specify compensating
controls under strict terms and conditions.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                            PAGE 9
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls can be
     assigned to responsible organizational officials or organizational elements (other than the
     information system owners whose systems will implement or use the common security
     controls); and
•    The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to support the
     security certification and accreditation processes of organizational information systems where
     the controls have been applied. 22

The identification of common security controls is most effectively accomplished as an
organization-wide exercise with the involvement of the chief information officer, senior agency
information security officer, authorizing officials, information system owners/program managers,
information owners, and information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise
considers the categories of information systems within the organization in accordance with FIPS
199 (i.e., low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information systems) and the minimum
security controls necessary to protect the operations and assets supported by those systems (see
baseline security controls in Section 2.2). For example, common security controls can be
identified for all low-impact information systems by considering the baseline security controls for
that category of information system. Similar exercises can be conducted for moderate-impact and
high-impact systems as well.

Many of the security controls needed to protect an information system (e.g., contingency planning
controls, incident response controls, security training and awareness controls, personnel security
controls, physical and environmental protection controls, and intrusion detection controls) may be
excellent candidates for common security control status. By centrally managing the development,
implementation, and assessment of the common security controls designated by the organization,
security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems. Security controls not
designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls and are the responsibility
of the information system owner. Security plans for individual information systems should
clearly identify which security controls have been designated by the organization as common
security controls and which controls have been designated as system-specific controls.

Organizations may also assign a hybrid status to security controls in situations where one part of
the control is deemed to be common, while another part of the control is deemed to be system-
specific. For example, an organization may view the IR-1 (Incident Response Policy and
Procedures) security control as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control deemed to
be common and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be system-specific. Hybrid
controls may also serve as templates for further control refinement. An organization may choose,
for example, to implement the CP-2 (Contingency Planning) security control as a master template
for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with individual
information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific issues.

Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific issues associated with the
implementation of an organization’s common security controls. These issues are identified and
described in the system security plans for the individual information systems. The senior agency
information security officer, acting on behalf of the chief information officer, should coordinate
with organizational officials (e.g., facilities managers, site managers, personnel managers)
responsible for the development and implementation of the designated common security controls
to ensure that the required controls are put into place, the controls are assessed, and the
22
  NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security certification and accreditation of information
systems.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                        PAGE 10

assessment results are shared with the appropriate information system owners to better support
the security accreditation process.

Partitioning security controls into common controls and system-specific controls can result in
significant savings to the organization in development and implementation costs especially when
the common controls serve multiple information systems and entities. It can also result in a more
consistent application of the security controls across the organization at large. Moreover, equally
significant savings can be realized in the security certification and accreditation process. Rather
than assessing common security controls in every information system, the certification process
draws upon any applicable results from the most current assessment of the common security
controls performed at the organization level. An organization-wide approach to reuse and sharing
of assessment results can greatly enhance the efficiency of the security certifications and
accreditations being conducted by organizations and significantly reduce security program costs.

While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls and system-
specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this principle within an
organization takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an organization is just beginning
to implement this approach or has only partially implemented this approach, it may take some
time to get the maximum benefits from security control partitioning and the associated reuse of
assessment evidence. Because of the potential dependence on common security controls by many
of an organization’s information systems, a failure of such common controls may result in a
significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that arises from the operation of the systems that
depend on these controls.

                                                Implementation Tip
     The FIPS 199 security categorization process and the selection of common security controls are closely
     related activities that are most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis with the
     involvement of the organization’s senior leadership (i.e., authorizing officials, chief information officer,
     senior agency information security officer, information system owners, and mission/information owners).
     These individuals have the collective corporate knowledge to understand the organization’s priorities, the
     importance of the organization’s operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation) and
     assets, and the relative importance of the organizational information systems that support those
     operations and assets. The organization’s senior leaders are also in the best position to select the
     common security controls for each of the security control baselines and assign organizational
     responsibilities for developing, implementing, and assessing those controls.




2.4 SECURITY CONTROLS IN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS
Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by
external service providers to carry out important missions and functions. External information
system services are services that are implemented outside of the system’s accreditation boundary
(i.e., services that are used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system).
Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example,
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business 23 arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply
23
   In March 2004, OMB initiated a governmentwide analysis of selected lines of business supporting the President's
Management Agenda goal to expand Electronic Government. Interagency task forces examined business and
information technology data and best practices for each line of business—Case Management, Financial Management,
Grants Management, Human Resources Management, Federal Health Architecture, Information Systems Security,
Budget Formulation and Execution, Geospatial, and IT Infrastructure. The goal of the effort is to identify opportunities
to reduce the cost of government and improve services to citizens through business performance improvements.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                       PAGE 11
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                  Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


chain exchanges. The growing dependence on external service providers and new relationships
being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for the organization,
especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include, but are not
limited to: (i) defining the types of external services provided to the organization; 24 (ii) describing
how the external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the
organization; and (iii) obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to the organization’s
operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of the external services is at an
acceptable level.

The assurance or confidence that the risk to the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals
is at an acceptable level depends on the trust 25 that the authorizing official places in the external
service provider. In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the
authorizing official is able to exert on the external service provider with regard to the
employment of appropriate security controls necessary for the protection of the service and the
evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is usually
established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-level agreement with the
external service provider and can range from extensive (e.g., negotiating a contract or agreement
that specifies detailed security control requirements for the provider 26 ) to very limited (e.g., using
a contract or service-level agreement to obtain commodity services 27 such as commercial
telecommunications services). In other cases, the level of trust is derived from other factors that
convince the authorizing official that the requisite security controls have been employed and that
a credible determination of control effectiveness exists. For example, a separately accredited
external information system service provided to a federal agency through a line of business
relationship may provide a degree of trust in the external service within the tolerable risk range of
the authorizing official.



24
   Information exchanges may be required among the many possible relationships with external service providers. The
risk of exchanging information among business partners and other external entities must be assessed and appropriate
security controls employed. There may be contract language that establishes specific requirements to protect
information exchanged and/or that specifies particular remedies for failure to protect the information as prescribed. In
addition, there may be laws or regulations that protect this information from unauthorized disclosure.
25
  The level of trust that an organization places in an external service provider can vary widely ranging from those who
are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector).
26
  In reality, the provision of services by providers external to the organization may result in some services without
explicit agreements between the organization and the external entities responsible for the services. Whenever explicit
agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements, etc.), the organization should
develop such agreements and require the use of the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. When the
organization is not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers (e.g., when the service is
imposed on the organization or when the service is commodity service), the organization should establish explicit
assumptions about the service capabilities with regard to security. Contracts between the organization and external
service providers may also require the active participation of the organization. For example, the organization may be
required by the contract to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by the service provider.
27
  Normally, commercial providers of commodity-type services (e.g., telecommunications services) organize their
business models and services around the concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer
base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain fully dedicated services from commercial service providers (including
dedicated devices and management systems), there will likely be a need for greater reliance on compensating security
controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services. The
organization’s risk assessment and risk mitigation activities should reflect this situation.




CHAPTER 2                                                                                                           PAGE 12
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization’s operations and
assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains
with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust
be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with
information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires
that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service
provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
for the services rendered to the organization. The chain of trust can be very complicated due to
the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the type of
relationship between the parties. External service providers may also in turn outsource the
services to other external entities, making the chain of trust even more complicated and difficult
to manage. Depending on the nature of the service, it may simply be unwise for the organization
to wholly trust the provider—not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the provider's part, but
due to the intrinsic level of risk in the service. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be
established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs
compensating controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to
individuals.

2.5 SECURITY CONTROL ASSURANCE
Assurance is the grounds for confidence 28 that the security controls implemented within an
information system are effective in their application. Assurance can be obtained in a variety of
ways including: (i) actions taken by developers and implementers 29 of security controls in the
design, development, and implementation techniques and methods; and (ii) actions taken by
security control assessors during the testing and evaluation process to determine the extent to
which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Assurance
considerations related to developers and implementers of security controls are addressed in this
special publication. Assurance considerations related to assessors of security controls (including
certification agents, evaluators, auditors, inspectors general) are addressed in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.

Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for security controls listed in the low,
moderate, and high baselines. For security controls in the low baseline, the emphasis is on the
control being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are
discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner. For security controls in the moderate baseline,
the emphasis is on increasing grounds for confidence in control correctness. While flaws are still
likely to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer or control
implementer incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities to increase grounds for
confidence that the control meets its function or purpose. For security controls in the high
baseline, the emphasis is on requiring within the control the capabilities that are needed to support
ongoing, consistent operation of the control and to support continuous improvement in the
control’s effectiveness. There are additional assurance requirements available to developers and
28
   Confidence that the necessary security controls have been effectively implemented in organizational information
systems provides a foundation for trust between organizations that depend upon the information processed, stored, or
transmitted by those information systems.
29
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls for an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and software
vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as information
system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other individuals with
security responsibility for the information system.



CHAPTER 2                                                                                                      PAGE 13

________________________________________________________________________________________________


implementers of security controls supplementing the minimum assurance requirements for the
moderate and high baselines in order to protect against threats from highly skilled, highly
motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of protection is necessary for those
information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the risks associated with the
type of threat agents cited above.

2.6 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The set of security controls listed in the control catalog represents the current state-of-the-practice
safeguards and countermeasures for information systems. The security controls will be reviewed
and revised periodically to reflect: (i) the experience gained from using the controls; (ii) the
changing security requirements within organizations; (iii) emerging threats and attack methods;
and (iv) the availability of new security technologies. 30 The controls in the control catalog are
expected to change over time, as controls are eliminated or revised and new controls are added.
The minimum security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high baselines are also
expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for mitigating risks within
organizations increases. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability will be
addressed by requiring that proposed additions, deletions, or modifications to the catalog of
security controls go through a rigorous public review process to obtain government and private
sector feedback and to build consensus for the changes. A stable, yet flexible and technically
rigorous set of security controls will be maintained in the control catalog.




30
   Currently, NIST plans to review and revise the security control catalog and security control baselines in Special
Publication 800-53 on a biennial basis. The proposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines
will be carefully weighed with each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability on one hand, and the need to
respond to changing threats and vulnerabilities, new attack methods, new technologies, and the important objective of
raising the foundational level of security over time.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS




T
        his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for an
        information system including: (i) defining the organization’s overall approach to managing
        risk; (ii) categorizing the system in accordance with FIPS 199; (iii) selecting and tailoring
the initial set of minimum (baseline) security controls; 31 (iv) supplementing the tailored security
control baseline as necessary based upon an organizational assessment of risk; and (v) updating
the controls as part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process.

3.1 MANAGING RISK
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of
risk—that is, the risk to the organization or to individuals associated with the operation of an
information system. The management of risk is a key element in the organization’s information
security program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate security
controls for an information system—the security controls necessary to protect individuals and the
operations and assets of the organization. The risk-based approach to security control selection
and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. The following activities related
to managing risk (also known as the NIST Risk Management Framework) are paramount to an
effective information security program and can be applied to both new and legacy information
systems within the context of the system development life cycle and the Federal Enterprise
Architecture—
•    Categorize the information system and the information resident within that system based on a
     FIPS 199 impact analysis.
•    Select an initial set of security controls (i.e., security control baseline from Appendix D) for
     the information system based on the FIPS 199 security categorization and the minimum
     security requirements defined in FIPS 200; apply tailoring guidance from Section 3.3 as
     appropriate, to obtain the control set used as the starting point for the assessment of risk
     associated with the use of the system.
•    Supplement the initial set of tailored security controls based on an assessment of risk and
     local conditions including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat
     information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances. 32
•    Document the agreed-upon set of security controls in the system security plan including the
     organization’s rationale for any refinements or adjustments to the initial set of controls. 33



31
  Tailoring guidance provides organizations with specific considerations on the applicability and implementation of
individual security controls in the control baselines (see Section 3.3).
32
  NIST Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance
on the assessment and mitigation of risk.
33
  NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, provides
guidance on documenting information system security controls.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Implement the security controls in the information system. For legacy systems, some or all of
     the security controls selected may already be in place.
•    Assess the security controls using appropriate methods and procedures to determine the
     extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
     the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. 34
•    Authorize information system operation based upon a determination of the risk to
     organizational operations, organizational assets, or to individuals resulting from the operation
     of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable. 35
•    Monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on a continuous basis
     including documenting changes to the system, conducting security impact analyses of the
     associated changes, and reporting the security status of the system to appropriate
     organizational officials on a regular basis.

Figure 1 illustrates the specific activities in the NIST Risk Management Framework and the
information security standards and guidance documents associated with each activity.

3.2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
FIPS 199, the mandatory federal security categorization standard, is predicated on a simple and
well-established concept—determining appropriate priorities for organizational information
systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to adequately protect those systems.
The security controls applied to a particular information system should be commensurate with the
potential impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals should there
be a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS 199 requires organizations to
categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the
security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The potential impact values
assigned to the respective security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark) from
among the security categories that have been determined for each type of information resident on
those information systems. 36 The generalized format for expressing the security category (SC) of
an information system is:
          SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
                    where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept is used to determine
the impact level of the information system for the express purpose of selecting an initial set of
security controls from one of the three security control baselines. 37 Thus, a low-impact system is
defined as an information system in which all three of the security objectives are low. A
moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least one of the security objectives
is moderate and no security objective is greater than moderate. And finally, a high-impact system
is an information system in which at least one security objective is high.

                                                  Implementation Tip
  To determine the overall impact level of the information system:
  •    First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the
       information system (e.g., financial sector oversight, inspections and auditing, official information
       dissemination, etc.). NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides guidance on a variety of information
       types commonly used by organizations.
  •    Second, using the impact levels in FIPS 199 and the recommendations of NIST Special Publication
       800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each information type as low,
       moderate, or high impact.
  •    Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact level for
       each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations for the
       information types associated with the information system.
  •    Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact level
       among the three security objectives in the system security categorization.




36
   NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.
37
   The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, the security controls in the control catalog are not categorized by
security objective—rather, they are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of
information systems based on impact level. The application of scoping guidance may allow selective security control
baseline tailoring (see Section 3.3).

3.3 SELECTING AND TAILORING THE INITIAL BASELINE
Once the overall impact level of the information system is determined, an initial set of security
controls can be selected from the corresponding low, moderate, or high baselines listed in
Appendix D. Organizations have the flexibility to tailor the security control baselines in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this publication. Tailoring activities
include: (i) the application of appropriate scoping guidance to the initial baseline; (ii) the
specification of compensating security controls, if needed; and (iii) the specification of
organization-defined parameters in the security controls, where allowed. To achieve a cost-
effective, risk-based approach to providing adequate information security organization-wide,
security control baseline tailoring activities should be coordinated with and approved by
appropriate organizational officials (e.g., chief information officers, senior agency information
security officers, authorizing officials, or authorizing officials’ designated representatives).
Tailoring decisions should be documented in the security plan for the information system. 38

Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides organizations with specific terms and conditions on the applicability
and implementation of individual security controls in the security control baselines. There are
several considerations, described below, that can potentially impact how the baseline security
controls are applied by the organization:
Common security control-related considerations—
•    Security controls designated by the organization as common controls are, in most cases,
     managed by an organizational entity other than the information system owner.
     Organizational decisions on which security controls are viewed as common controls may
     greatly affect the responsibilities of individual information system owners with regard to the
     implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Every control in a baseline must be fully
     addressed either by the organization or the information system owner.

Operational/environmental-related considerations—
•    Security controls that are dependent on the nature of the operational environment are
     applicable only if the information system is employed in an environment necessitating the
     controls. For example, certain physical security controls may not be applicable to space-
     based information systems, and temperature and humidity controls may not be applicable to
     remote sensors that exist outside of the indoor facilities that contain information systems.

Physical Infrastructure-related considerations—
•    Security controls that refer to organizational facilities (e.g., physical controls such as locks
     and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting, fire, and power) are
     applicable only to those sections of the facilities that directly provide protection to, support
     for, or are related to the information system (including its information technology assets such
     as electronic mail or web servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, boundary
     protection devices, and communications equipment).

38
   It is important for organizations to document the decisions taken during the security control baseline tailoring
process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions whenever possible. This documentation is essential when
examining the overall security considerations for information systems with respect to potential mission and/or business
case impact.

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Public access-related considerations—
•    Security controls associated with public access information systems should be carefully
     considered and applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control
     baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be
     applicable to users accessing information systems through public interfaces. For example,
     while the baseline controls require identification and authentication of organizational
     personnel that maintain and support information systems providing the public access services,
     the same controls might not be required for access to those information systems through
     public interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other hand, identification
     and authentication would be required for users accessing information systems through public
     interfaces in some instances, for example, to access/change their personal information.

Technology-related considerations—
•    Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
     infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
     employed within the information system.
•    Security controls are applicable only to the components of the information system that
     provide or support the security capability addressed by the control and are sources of
     potential risk being mitigated by the control. 39 For example, when information system
     components are single-user, not networked, or only locally networked, one or more of these
     characteristics may provide appropriate rationale for not applying selected controls to that
     component.
•    Security controls that can be either explicitly or implicitly supported by automated
     mechanisms, do not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not
     already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products.
     In situations where automated mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or
     technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated
     mechanisms or procedures, should be used to satisfy specified security controls or control
     enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below).

Policy/regulatory-related considerations—
•    Security controls that address matters governed by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
     directives, policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., privacy impact assessments) are required
     only if the employment of those controls is consistent with the types of information and
     information systems covered by the applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
     standards, or regulations.




39
   For example, auditing controls would typically be applied to the components of an information system that provide
or should provide auditing capability (servers, etc.) and would not necessarily be applied to every user-level
workstation within the organization. Organizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose
their information systems to determine which security controls are applicable to the various components. As
technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in such devices as personal digital
assistants and cellular telephones, which may require the application of security controls in accordance with an
organizational assessment of risk. While the tailoring guidance may support not applying a particular security control
to a specific component (e.g., the audit example above), any residual risks associated with the absence of that control
must still be addressed and mitigated as necessary to adequately protect the organization’s operations, assets, and
individuals.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                        PAGE 19
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                  Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Scalability-related considerations—

•    Security controls are scalable with regard to the extent and rigor of the control
     implementation. Scalability is guided by the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
     information system being protected. For example, a contingency plan for a FIPS 199 high-
     impact information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of
     implementation detail. In contrast, a contingency plan for a FIPS 199 low-impact
     information system may be considerably shorter and contain much less implementation
     detail. Organizations should use discretion in applying the security controls to information
     systems, giving consideration to the scalability factors in particular environments. This
     approach facilitates a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control implementation
     that expends no more resources than necessary, yet achieves sufficient risk mitigation and
     adequate security.

Security objective-related considerations—
•    Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security
     objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
     appropriately modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) if, and only if, the
     downgrading action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS 199 security categorization for the
     corresponding security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, or availability before moving
     to the high water mark; 40 (ii) is supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii)
     does not affect the security-relevant information within the information system. 41 The
     following security controls are recommended candidates for downgrading: (i) confidentiality
     [AC-15, MA-3 (3), MP-2 (1), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5 (1) (2) (3), MP-6, PE-5, SC-4, SC-9]; (ii)
     integrity [SC-8]; and (iii) availability [CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, MA-6, PE-9,
     PE-10, PE-11, PE-13, PE-15, SC-6]. 42




40
   When applying the “high water mark” process in Section 3.2, some of the original FIPS 199 confidentiality, integrity,
or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher baseline of security controls. As part of this
process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
41
   Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables, cryptographic
key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within an information system. Certain
security controls within an information system are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and
integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality
or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the downgrading action does not result in insufficient protection for
the security-relevant information within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the
high water mark in order to achieve that level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level
information.
42
   Certain security controls that are uniquely attributable to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would
ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading (e.g., AC-16, AU-10, CP-5, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, PL-
5, SC-5, SC-13, SC-14, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls are either selected for use in all
baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are optional and not selected for use in
any baseline. Organizations should exercise extreme caution when considering downgrading actions on any security
controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.3 to ensure that the downgrading action does not affect security
objectives other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                          PAGE 20
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Compensating Security Controls
With the diverse nature of today’s information systems, organizations may find it necessary, on
occasion, to specify and employ compensating security controls. A compensating security
control is a management, operational, or technical control (i.e., safeguard or countermeasure)
employed by an organization in lieu of a recommended security control in the low, moderate, or
high baselines described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, that provides equivalent or
comparable protection for an information system. 43 A compensating control for an information
system may be employed by an organization only under the following conditions: (i) the
organization selects the compensating control from NIST Special Publication 800-53, or if an
appropriate compensating control is not available in the security control catalog, the organization
adopts a suitable compensating control; 44 (ii) the organization provides a complete and
convincing rationale 45 for how the compensating control provides an equivalent security
capability or level of protection for the information system and why the related baseline security
control could not be employed; and (iii) the organization assesses and formally accepts the risk
associated with employing the compensating control in the information system. The use of
compensating security controls should be documented in the security plan for the information
system and approved by the authorizing official.

Organization-Defined Security Control Parameters
Security controls containing organization-defined parameters (i.e., assignment and/or selection
operations) give organizations the flexibility to define selected portions of the controls to support
specific organizational requirements or objectives (see AU-2 example in Section 2.1). After the
application of the scoping guidance and the selection of compensating security controls,
organizations should review the list of security controls for assignment and selection operations
and determine appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Where
specified, minimum and maximum values for organization-defined parameters should be adhered
to unless more restrictive values are prescribed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations or are indicated by the risk assessment in order to adequately
mitigate risk. Organization-defined security control parameters should be documented in the
security plan for the information system.

3.4 SUPPLEMENTING THE TAILORED BASELINE
The tailored security control baseline should be viewed as the foundation or starting point in the
selection of adequate security controls for an information system. The tailored baseline
represents, for a particular class of information system (derived from the FIPS 199 security
categorization and modified appropriately for local conditions), the starting point for determining
the needed level of security due diligence to be demonstrated by an organization toward the
protection of its operations and assets. As described in Section 3.1, the final determination of the
appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate security for an information

43
  More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent or comparable protection for a
particular security control in NIST Special Publication 800-53. For example, an organization with significant staff
limitations may have difficulty in meeting the separation of duty security control but may employ compensating
controls by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls within the information system.
44
  Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST
Special Publication 800-53. Organization-defined compensating controls should be used only as a last resort when the
security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.
45
   The depth and rigor of the rationale provided should be scaled to the FIPS 199 impact level of the information
system, with significantly less explanation needed for a low-impact system than for a high-impact system.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                       PAGE 21

________________________________________________________________________________________________


system is a function of the organization’s assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently
mitigate the risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. 46

In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements will be needed to address
specific threats to and vulnerabilities in an information system or to satisfy the requirements of
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. The risk
assessment at this stage in the security control selection process provides important inputs to
determine the sufficiency of the security controls in the tailored baseline—that is, the security
controls needed to adequately protect the organization’s operations (including mission, function,
image, and reputation), the organization’s assets, and individuals. Organizations are encouraged
to make maximum use of the security control catalog to facilitate the process of enhancing
security controls or adding controls to the tailored baseline. To assist in this process, the security
control catalog in Appendix F contains numerous controls and control enhancements that are
found only in higher-impact baselines or are not included in any of the baselines.

There may be situations in which an organization discovers it is employing information
technology beyond its ability to adequately protect critical and/or essential missions. That is, the
organization cannot apply sufficient security controls within an information system to adequately
reduce or mitigate mission risk. In those situations, an alternative strategy is needed to protect the
mission from being impeded; a strategy that considers the mission risks that are being brought
about by an aggressive use of information technology. Information system use restrictions
provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk, for example, when: (i) security controls
cannot be implemented within technology and resource constraints; or (ii) security controls lack
reasonable expectation of effectiveness against identified threat sources. Restrictions on the use
of an information system are sometimes the only prudent or practical course of action to enable
mission accomplishment in the face of determined adversaries.

The determination of required system use restrictions should be made by organizational officials
having a vested interest in the accomplishment of organizational missions. These officials
typically include, but are not limited to, the information system owner, mission owner,
authorizing official, senior agency information security officer, and chief information officer.
Examples of use restrictions include: (i) limiting either the information an information system can
process, store, or transmit or the manner in which a mission is automated; (ii) prohibiting external
information system access to critical organizational information by removing selected system
components from the network (i.e., air gapping); and (iii) prohibiting moderate- or high-impact
information on an information system component to which the public has access, unless an
explicit determination is made authorizing such access.

It is important for organizations to document the decisions taken during the security control
selection process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions whenever possible. This
documentation is essential when examining the overall security considerations for information
systems with respect to potential mission and/or business case impact. The resulting set of
agreed-upon security controls along with the supporting rationale for control selection decisions
and any information system use restrictions are documented in the security plan for the
information system.



46
     The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA
PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level impacts in categorizing the
information system.

                              FIGURE 2: SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS


3.5 UPDATING SECURITY CONTROLS
As part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring program, organizations should initiate specific
actions to determine if there is a need to update the current, agreed-upon set of security controls
documented in the security plan and implemented within the information system. Specifically,
the organization should revisit, on a regular basis, the risk management activities described in the
Risk Management Framework in Section 3.1. Additionally, there are events which can trigger the
immediate need to assess the security state of the information system and if required, update the
current security controls. These events include, for example:
•    An incident results in a breach to the information system, producing a loss of confidence in
     the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information processed, stored, or transmitted
     by the system;
•    A newly identified, credible threat exists to the organization’s operations or assets, or to
     individuals (due to the use of the information system supporting those operations, assets, or
     individuals) based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other
     credible sources of information; or
•    Significant changes to the configuration of the information system through the removal or
     addition of new or upgraded hardware, software, or firmware or changes in the operational
     environment potentially degrade the security state of the system.

When events such as those described above occur, organizations should at a minimum: 47



47
  Organizations should determine the specific types of events that would trigger a modification to the security plan and
changes to the security controls within the information system. The decision to commit resources in light of such
events should be guided by an organizational assessment of risk to the organization’s operations and assets, or to
individuals, that would result if these modifications and changes are not made.



CHAPTER 3                                                                                                        PAGE 23
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 2        Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Reconfirm the criticality/sensitivity of the information system and the information processed,
     stored, and/or transmitted by that system.
     The organization should reexamine the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system to
     confirm the criticality/sensitivity of the system in supporting its mission operations or
     business case. The resulting impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
     individuals may provide new insights as to the overall importance of the system in allowing
     the organization to fulfill its mission responsibilities.
•    Assess the current security state of the information system and reassess the current risk to
     organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.
     The organization should investigate the information system vulnerability (or vulnerabilities)
     exploited by the threat source (or that are potentially exploitable by a threat source) and the
     security controls currently implemented within the system as described in the security plan.
     The exploitation of an information system vulnerability (or vulnerabilities) by a threat source
     may be traced to one or more factors including but not limited to: (i) the failure of currently
     implemented security controls; (ii) missing security controls; (iii) insufficient strength of
     security controls; and/or (iv) an increase in the sophistication or capability of the threat
     source. Using the results from the assessment of the current security state, the organization
     should reassess the risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
     arising from use of the information system.
•    Plan for and initiate any necessary corrective actions.
     Based on the results of an updated risk assessment, the organization should determine what
     additional security controls and/or control enhancements may be necessary to address the
     vulnerability (or vulnerabilities) related to the event or what corrective actions may be needed
     to fix currently implemented controls deemed to be less than effective.
     The security plan for the information system should then be updated to reflect these
     corrective actions. A Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) should be developed for any
     deficiencies noted that are not immediately corrected and for the implementation of any
     security control upgrades or additional controls. After the security controls or control
     upgrades have been implemented and any other noted deficiencies corrected, the controls
     should be assessed for effectiveness. The assessment determines if the security controls are
     implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
     respect to meeting the organization’s security policy.
•    Consider reaccrediting the information system.
     Depending on the severity of the event, the impact on organizational operations,
     organizational assets, or individuals, and the extent of the corrective actions required to fix
     the identified deficiencies in the information system, the organization may need to consider
     reaccrediting the information system in accordance with the provisions of NIST Special
     Publication 800-37. The authorizing official makes the final determination on the need to
     reaccredit the information system in consultation with the system and mission owners, the
     senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer. The authorizing
     official may choose to conduct an abbreviated reaccreditation focusing only on the affected
     components of the information system and the associated security controls and/or control
     enhancements which have been changed during the update. Authorizing officials should have
     sufficient information from the security certification process to initiate, with an appropriate
     degree of confidence, the necessary corrective actions to adequately protect individuals and
     the organization’s operations and assets.

                                     and diverse set of consumers. The organization acquiring and/or
                                     receiving the commodity service possesses limited visibility into
                                     the management structure and operations of the provider and
                                     while the organization may be able to negotiate service-level
                                     agreements, the organization is typically not in a position to
                                     require that the provider implement specific security controls.

                                     development, implementation, and assessment of the control can
                                     be assigned to a responsible official or organizational element
                                     (other than the information system owner); and (ii) the results
                                     from the assessment of the control can be used to support the
                                     security certification and accreditation processes of an agency
                                     information system where that control has been applied.

                                     with security controls and safeguards.
 Controlled Area                     Any area or space for which the organization has confidence that
                                     the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to
                                     meet the requirements established for protecting the information
                                     and/or information system.
 Executive Agency                    An executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 101; a

 Line of Business                    The following OMB-defined process areas common to virtually
                                     all federal agencies: Case Management, Financial Management,
                                     Grants Management, Human Resources Management, Federal
                                     Health Architecture, Information Systems Security, Budget
                                     Formulation and Execution, Geospatial, and IT Infrastructure.
 Local Access                        Access to an organizational information system by a user (or an
                                     information system) communicating through an internal
                                     organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or
                                     directly to a device without the use of a network.
 Low-Impact System                   An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e.,
 [FIPS 200]                          confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS
                                     199 potential impact value of low.
 Major Application                   An application that requires special attention to security due to
 [OMB Circular A-130,                the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
 Appendix III]                       unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the
                                     application. Note: All federal applications require some level of
                                     protection. Certain applications, because of the information in
                                     them, however, require special management oversight and should
                                     be treated as major. Adequate security for other applications
                                     should be provided by security of the systems in which they
                                     operate.
 Major Information System            An information system that requires special management
 [OMB Circular A-130]                attention because of its importance to an agency mission; its high

 [NIST SP 800-61]                    integrity, or availability of an information system. A virus,
                                     worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host.
                                     Spyware and some forms of adware are also examples of
                                     malicious code.
 Malware                             See Malicious Code.

APPENDIX D

MINIMUM SECURITY CONTROLS – SUMMARY
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS




T
        he following table lists the minimum security controls, or security control baselines, for
        low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems. The three security
        control baselines are hierarchical in nature with regard to the security controls employed in
those baselines. 48 If a security control is selected for one of the baselines, the family identifier
and control number are listed in the appropriate column. If a control is not used in a particular
baseline, the entry is marked “not selected.” Control enhancements, when used to supplement
basic security controls, are indicated by the number of the control enhancement. For example, an
“IR-2 (1)” in the high baseline entry for the IR-2 security control indicates that the second control
from the Incident Response family has been selected along with control enhancement (1). Some
security controls and control enhancements in the security control catalog are not used in any of
the baselines but are available for use by organizations if needed; for example, when the results of
a risk assessment indicate the need for additional controls or control enhancements in order to
adequately mitigate risks to individuals, the organization, or its assets. A complete description of
security controls, supplemental guidance for the controls, and control enhancements is provided
in Appendix F. A detailed listing of security controls and control enhancements for each control
baseline is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.




48
   The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a
particular impact level (e.g., AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions—Moderate: AC-18 (1)) meets a stronger set of
security requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., AC-18 Wireless Access
Restrictions—Low: AC-18). Since the numerical designation of a control enhancement is neither indicative of the
relative strength of the enhancement nor assumes any hierarchical relationship among enhancements, there are some
controls (e.g., IA-2) that may not appear to satisfy the hierarchical nature of the security requirements of each control
even though they do. For example, with IA-2 User Identification and Authentication, enhancement (1) is called out for
the moderate baseline and enhancements (2) and (3) are called out for the high baseline. In this case, high [IA-2(2)(3)]
is hierarchical to moderate [IA-2(1)] with regard to the security requirements being imposed.

APPENDIX E

MINIMUM ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
LOW, MODERATE, AND HIGH BASELINE APPLICATIONS




T
       he minimum assurance requirements for security controls described in the security control
       catalog are listed below. The assurance requirements are directed at the activities and
       actions that security control developers and implementers 49 define and apply to increase
the level of confidence that the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
information system. The assurance requirements are applied on a control-by-control basis. The
requirements are grouped by security control baseline (i.e., low, moderate, and high) since the
requirements apply to each control within the respective baseline. Using a format similar to
security controls, assurance requirements are followed by supplemental guidance that provides
additional detail and explanation of how the requirements are to be applied. Bolded text indicates
requirements that appear for the first time in a particular baseline.

Low Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the low baseline, the focus is on the controls being in place
with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are discovered, they are addressed in a
timely manner.

Moderate Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the control.
The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned
responsibilities and specific actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is
implemented, it will meet its required function or purpose. These actions include, for example,
requiring the development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this
determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the moderate baseline, the focus is on actions supporting
increased confidence in the correct implementation and operation of the control. While flaws are still likely
to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer/implementer incorporates, as part of
the control, specific capabilities and produces specific documentation supporting increased confidence that
the control meets its required function or purpose. This documentation is also needed by assessors to
analyze and test the functional properties of the control as part of the overall assessment of the control.

High Baseline
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis


49
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls for an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and software
vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as information
system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other individuals with
security responsibility for the information system.

and testing of the control (including functional interfaces among control components). The control
developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned responsibilities and specific
actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and
consistently (i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support
improvement in the effectiveness of the control. These actions include, for example, requiring the
development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the high baseline, the focus is expanded to require, within
the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the control and
continuous improvement in the control’s effectiveness. The developer/implementer is expected to expend
significant effort on the design, development, implementation, and component/integration testing of the
controls and to produce associated design and implementation documentation to support these activities.
This documentation is also needed by assessors to analyze and test the internal components of the control
as part of the overall assessment of the control.

Additional Requirements Enhancing the Moderate and High Baselines
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
testing of the control. The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, actions
supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently
(i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the
effectiveness of the control. These actions include requiring the development of records with structure and
content suitable to facilitate making this determination. The control is developed in a manner that
supports a high degree of confidence that the control is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: The additional high assurance requirements are intended to supplement the
minimum assurance requirements for the moderate and high baselines, when appropriate, in order to protect
against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of
protection is necessary for those information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the
risks associated with the type of threat agents cited above.

APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE, AND CONTROL ENHANCEMENTS




T
       he following catalog of security controls provides a range of safeguards and
       countermeasures for information systems. The security controls are organized into
       families for ease of use in the control selection and specification process. Each family
contains security controls related to the security functionality of the family. A standardized, two-
character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. To uniquely identify
each control, a numeric identifier is appended to the family identifier to indicate the number of
the control within the control family.

The security control structure consists of three key components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; and (iii) a control enhancements section. The control section
provides a concise statement of the specific security capability needed to protect a particular
aspect of an information system. The control statement describes specific security-related
activities or actions to be carried out by the organization or by the information system. For some
controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to
selectively define input values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection operations within the control.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations are expected to apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, when
defining, developing, and implementing security controls. In certain instances, the supplemental
guidance provides more detail concerning the control requirements or important considerations
(and the needed flexibility) for implementing security controls in the context of an organization’s
operational environment, specific mission requirements, or assessment of risk. In addition,
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST Special Publications) are listed in the
supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the particular security control. 50

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a
basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control. The numerical designation of a security control
enhancement is used only to identify a particular enhancement within the control structure. The
designation is neither indicative of the relative strength of the control enhancement nor assumes
any hierarchical relationship among enhancements.




50
  NIST Special Publications listed in the supplemental guidance sections of security controls are assumed to refer to
the most recent updates to those publications. For example, a reference to NIST Special Publication 800-18 refers to
the Special Publication 800-18, Revision 1, which is the latest version of the security planning guideline.

                                           Cautionary Note
  The security controls described in this catalog should be employed in federal information systems in
  accordance with the risk management guidance provided in Chapter Three. This guidance includes the
  selection of minimum (baseline) security controls based upon the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
  information system and the tailoring of the minimum (baseline) security controls by: (i) applying
  appropriate scoping guidance; (ii) specifying compensating controls, if needed; and (iii) inserting
  organization-defined security control parameters, where allowed. Since the baseline security controls
  represent the minimum controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems,
  respectively, there are additional controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog that are
  not used in any of the baselines. These additional security controls and control enhancements are
  available to organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to achieve the
  needed level of protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. Moreover, security
  controls and control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be used by
  organizations to strengthen the level of protection provided in lower-level baselines, if deemed
  appropriate.

AC-1      ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and
          associated access controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The access control policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The access
          control policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Access control procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and
          for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides
          guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

AC-2      ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including establishing, activating,
          modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. The organization reviews information
          system accounts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].
          Supplemental Guidance: Account management includes the identification of account types (i.e.,
          individual, group, and system), establishment of conditions for group membership, and assignment
          of associated authorizations. The organization identifies authorized users of the information
          system and specifies access rights/privileges. The organization grants access to the information
          system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official
          duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria; and (ii) intended system usage. The
          organization requires proper identification for requests to establish information system accounts
          and approves all such requests. The organization specifically authorizes and monitors the use of
          guest/anonymous accounts and removes, disables, or otherwise secures unnecessary accounts.
          Account managers are notified when information system users are terminated or transferred and
          associated accounts are removed, disabled, or otherwise secured. Account managers are also
          notified when users’ information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
                system accounts.
          (2)   The information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts after
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
          (3)   The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organization-
                defined time period].
          (4)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to audit account creation, modification,
                disabling, and termination actions and to notify, as required, appropriate individuals.

AC-3      ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

          Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to the
          system in accordance with applicable policy.
          Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
          rule-based policies) and associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists,
          access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between
          users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes,
          programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to controlling access at the information
          system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
          necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given
          to the implementation of a controlled, audited, and manual override of automated mechanisms in
          the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed
          as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended)
          compliant. Related security control: SC-13.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system restricts access to privileged functions (deployed in hardware, software,
                and firmware) and security-relevant information to explicitly authorized personnel.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example,
                security administrators, system and network administrators, and other privileged users.
                Privileged users are individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or
                administration functions (e.g., system administrators, information system security officers,
                maintainers, system programmers).

AC-4      INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

          Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow of
          information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable
          policy.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
          within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
          access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A
          few, of many, generalized examples of possible restrictions that are better expressed as flow
          control than access control are: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in
          the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and
          not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information
          flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to
          control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
          individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow
          control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific
          examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies,
          gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish
          configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet filtering
          capability. Related security control: SC-7.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using explicit labels on
                information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control enforcement using explicit
                labels is used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.
          (2)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using protected
                processing domains (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decisions.
          (3)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using dynamic security
                policy mechanisms as a basis for flow control decisions.

AC-5      SEPARATION OF DUTIES

          Control: The information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access
          authorizations.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility and
          separates duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and duties of
          individuals. There is access control software on the information system that prevents users from
          having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform fraudulent activity without
          collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information
          system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals
          perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming,
          quality assurance/testing, configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security
          personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.

AC-6      LEAST PRIVILEGE

          Control: The information system enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses
          needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs the concept of least privilege for specific duties
          and information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk
          assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational
          assets, and individuals.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AC-6                   HIGH AC-6



AC-7      UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

          Control: The information system enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number]
          consecutive invalid access attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time
          period] time period. The information system automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for
          an [Assignment: organization-defined time period], delays next login prompt according to
          [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm.]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
          attempts is exceeded.
          Supplemental Guidance: Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
          the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
          period established by the organization.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator
                when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

AC-8      SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

          Control: The information system displays an approved, system use notification message before
          granting system access informing potential users: (i) that the user is accessing a U.S. Government
          information system; (ii) that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; (iii)
          that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
          (iv) that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording. The system use
          notification message provides appropriate privacy and security notices (based on associated
          privacy and security policies or summaries) and remains on the screen until the user takes explicit
          actions to log on to the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Privacy and security policies are consistent with applicable laws, Executive
          Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. System use notification
          messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log in to
          the information system. For publicly accessible systems: (i) the system use information is
          available and when appropriate, is displayed before granting access; (ii) any references to
          monitoring, recording, or auditing are in keeping with privacy accommodations for such systems
          that generally prohibit those activities; and (iii) the notice given to public users of the information
          system includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.

AC-11     SESSION LOCK

          Control: The information system prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock
          after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity, and the session lock remains in
          effect until the user reestablishes access using appropriate identification and authentication
          procedures.
          Supplemental Guidance: Users can directly initiate session lock mechanisms. A session lock is not a
          substitute for logging out of the information system. Organization-defined time periods of
          inactivity comply with federal policy; for example, in accordance with OMB Memorandum 06-16,
          the organization-defined time period is no greater than thirty minutes for remote access and
          portable devices.

          Supplemental Guidance: A remote session is initiated whenever an organizational information
          system is accessed by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-
          organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).
          Control Enhancements:

AC-13     SUPERVISION AND REVIEW — ACCESS CONTROL

          Control: The organization supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect to the
          enforcement and usage of information system access controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews audit records (e.g., user activity logs) for
          inappropriate activities in accordance with organizational procedures. The organization
          investigates any unusual information system-related activities and periodically reviews changes to
          access authorizations. The organization reviews more frequently the activities of users with
          significant information system roles and responsibilities. The extent of the audit record reviews is
          based on the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system. For example, for low-impact
          systems, it is not intended that security logs be reviewed frequently for every workstation, but
          rather at central points such as a web proxy or email servers and when specific circumstances
          warrant review of other audit records. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on

          Supplemental Guidance:  Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a
          user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled
          network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and
          wireless. Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web
          servers or systems specifically designed for public access. The organization restricts access
          achieved through dial-up connections (e.g., limiting dial-up access based upon source of request)
          or protects against unauthorized connections or subversion of authorized connections (e.g., using
          virtual private network technology). NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on
          remote electronic authentication. If the federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential is
          used as an identification token where cryptographic token-based access control is employed, the
          access control system conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publications
          800-73 and 800-78. NIST Special Publication 800-77 provides guidance on IPsec-based virtual

          assistants, cellular telephones, and other computing and communications devices with network
          connectivity and the capability of periodically operating in different physical locations) are only
          allowed access to organizational information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. Security policies and procedures include device identification and
          authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection,
          firewall), configuration management, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus
          protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary
          operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
          unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Protecting information residing on portable and
          mobile devices (e.g., employing cryptographic mechanisms to provide confidentiality and integrity
          protections during storage and while in transit when outside of controlled areas) is covered in the
          media protection family. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.

AC-20     USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

          Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions for authorized individuals to: (i) access
          the information system from an external information system; and (ii) process, store, and/or
          transmit organization-controlled information using an external information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of
          information systems that are outside of the accreditation boundary established by the organization
          and for which the organization typically has no direct control over the application of required
          security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. External information systems
          include, but are not limited to, personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular
          telephones, or personal digital assistants); privately owned computing and communications
          devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports);
          information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and federal
          information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct control of the
          organization.
          Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other individuals with
          authorized access to the organizational information system. This control does not apply to the use
          of external information systems to access organizational information systems and information that
          are intended for public access (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through public
          interfaces to organizational information systems). The organization establishes terms and
          conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of
          applications that can be accessed on the organizational information system from the external
          information system; and (ii) the maximum FIPS 199 security category of information that can be
          processed, stored, and transmitted on the external information system.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization prohibits authorized individuals from using an external information system to
                access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information
                except in situations where the organization: (i) can verify the employment of required security
                controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s information security policy and
                system security plan; or (ii) has approved information system connection or processing
                agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.

AU-2      AUDITABLE EVENTS

          Control: The information system generates audit records for the following events: [Assignment:
          organization-defined auditable events].
          Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to identify important events which need to be
          audited as significant and relevant to the security of the information system. The organization
          specifies which information system components carry out auditing activities. Auditing activity
          can affect information system performance. Therefore, the organization decides, based upon a risk
          assessment, which events require auditing on a continuous basis and which events require auditing
          in response to specific situations. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
          including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of
          abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate
          the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is
          coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual support
          between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each function. The
          checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended lists
          of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events that are adequate to support after-
          the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance
          on computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to compile audit records from multiple components
                throughout the system into a systemwide (logical or physical), time-correlated audit trail.
          (2)   The information system provides the capability to manage the selection of events to be audited by
                individual components of the system.
          (3)   The organization periodically reviews and updates the list of organization-defined auditable events.

          Control: The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized
          access, modification, and deletion.
          Supplemental Guidance: Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
          settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system produces audit records on hardware-enforced, write-once media.

          Control: The information system provides the capability to determine whether a given individual
          took a particular action.
          Supplemental Guidance: Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating
          information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a
          contract), and receiving a message. Non-repudiation protects against later false claims by an
          individual of not having taken a specific action. Non-repudiation protects individuals against later
          claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having
          transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having
          signed a document. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated
          from an individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a
          contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Non-repudiation
          services are obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures,
          digital message receipts, time stamps).

AU-11     AUDIT RECORD RETENTION

          Control: The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
          to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and
          organizational information retention requirements.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization retains audit records until it is determined that they are no
          longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
          example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
          requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions. Standard categorizations of audit records
          relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action are
          developed and disseminated. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides guidance on computer
          security incident handling and audit record retention.

CA-1      CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION, AND SECURITY ASSESSMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) formal,
          documented, security assessment and certification and accreditation policies that address purpose,
          scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
          entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation
          of the security assessment and certification and accreditation policies and associated assessment,
          certification, and accreditation controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The security assessment and certification and accreditation policies and
          procedures are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
          standards, and guidance. The security assessment and certification and accreditation policies can
          be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security
          assessment and certification and accreditation procedures can be developed for the security
          program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. The organization
          defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system to achieve consistent
          security reaccreditations. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security
          control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security certification

________________________________________________________________________________________________

CA-2      SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

          Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information
          system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] to determine the extent to
          which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
          outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to support the FISMA requirement that the
          management, operational, and technical controls in each information system contained in the
          inventory of major information systems be assessed with a frequency depending on risk, but no
          less than annually. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments
          should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those
          requirements already in place in the security certification and accreditation process. To satisfy the
          annual FISMA assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control
          assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security
          certifications conducted as part of an information system accreditation or reaccreditation process
          (see CA-4); (ii) continuous monitoring activities (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of the
          information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle process (provided that
          the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control
          effectiveness). Existing security assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid
          and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment information is
          critical in achieving a broad-based, cost-effective, and fully integrated security program capable of
          producing the needed evidence to determine the actual security status of the information system.
          OMB does not require an annual assessment of all security controls employed in an organizational
          information system. In accordance with OMB policy, organizations must annually assess a subset
          of the security controls based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information
          system; (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the
          information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or confidence) that the organization must have
          in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. It is expected
          that the organization will assess all of the security controls in the information system during the
          three-year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year’s assessment results
          obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-
          4). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security control assessments to
          include reuse of existing assessment results. Related security controls: CA-4, CA-6, CA-7, SA-
          11.

CA-3      INFORMATION SYSTEM CONNECTIONS

          Control: The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to other
          information systems outside of the accreditation boundary through the use of system connection
          agreements and monitors/controls the system connections on an ongoing basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: Since FIPS 199 security categorizations apply to individual information
          systems, the organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when systems are
          connected to other information systems with different security requirements and security controls,
          both within the organization and external to the organization. Risk considerations also include
          information systems sharing the same networks. NIST Special Publication 800-47 provides
          guidance on connecting information systems. Related security controls: SC-7, SA-9.

CA-4      SECURITY CERTIFICATION

          Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information
          system to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
          intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for
          the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: A security certification is conducted by the organization in support of the
          OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III requirement for accrediting the information system. The
          security certification is a key factor in all security accreditation (i.e., authorization) decisions and
          is integrated into and spans the system development life cycle. The organization assesses all
          security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to
          the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of
          the controls annually during continuous monitoring (see CA-7). The organization can use the
          current year’s assessment results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA
          assessment requirement (see CA-2). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on
          security control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security
          certification and accreditation. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-6, SA-11.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct an
                assessment of the security controls in the information system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An independent certification agent or certification team is
                any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational
                information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or
                actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management
                chain of command associated with the information system or to the determination of security
                control effectiveness. Independent security certification services can be obtained from other
                elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity
                outside of the organization. Contracted certification services are considered independent if
                the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot
                unduly influence the independence of the certification agent or certification team conducting
                the assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official
                decides on the required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity
                of the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and
                organizational assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of
                certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced
                are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for
                example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the
                organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished
                by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the
                system owner or authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be
                achieved by ensuring the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an
                independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the
                results. The authorizing official should consult with the Office of the Inspector General, the
                senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to fully discuss
                the implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special
                circumstances described above.

CA-5      PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES

          Control: The organization develops and updates [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], a
          plan of action and milestones for the information system that documents the organization’s
          planned, implemented, and evaluated remedial actions to correct deficiencies noted during the
          assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the security
          accreditation package developed for the authorizing official and is subject to federal reporting
          requirements established by OMB. The plan of action and milestones updates are based on the
          findings from security control assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring
          activities. OMB FISMA reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans
          of action and milestones. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the security
          certification and accreditation of information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides
          guidance on risk mitigation.

CA-6      SECURITY ACCREDITATION

          Control: The organization authorizes (i.e., accredits) the information system for processing before
          operations and updates the authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
          every three years] or when there is a significant change to the system. A senior organizational
          official signs and approves the security accreditation.
          Supplemental Guidance: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, establishes policy for security
          accreditations of federal information systems. The organization assesses the security controls
          employed within the information system before and in support of the security accreditation.
          Security assessments conducted in support of security accreditations are called security
          certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is not a static process. Through
          the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process (the fourth and final phase of
          the certification and accreditation process), the critical information contained in the accreditation
          package (i.e., the system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and
          milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis providing the authorizing official and the information
          system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To reduce
          the administrative burden of the three-year reaccreditation process, the authorizing official uses
          the results of the ongoing continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the
          basis for rendering a reaccreditation decision. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance
          on the security certification and accreditation of information systems. Related security controls:
          CA-2, CA-4, CA-7.

CA-7      CONTINUOUS MONITORING

          Control: The organization monitors the security controls in the information system on an ongoing
          basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and
          control of information system components, security impact analyses of changes to the system,
          ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The organization assesses all
          security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to
          the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of
          the controls annually during continuous monitoring. The selection of an appropriate subset of
          security controls is based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system;
          (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the
          information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or grounds for confidence) that the
          organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information
          system. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the
          security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also
          establishes the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Those
          security controls that are volatile or critical to protecting the information system are assessed at
          least annually. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system’s three-
          year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year’s assessment results obtained
          during continuous monitoring to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2).
          This control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in monitoring
          configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous monitoring program
          results in ongoing updates to the information system security plan, the security assessment report,
          and the plan of action and milestones—the three principle documents in the security accreditation
          package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the
          level of effort required for the reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special
          Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the continuous monitoring process. NIST Special
          Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment of security controls. Related security
          controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to monitor the
                security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization can extend and maximize the value of
                the ongoing assessment of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by
                requiring an independent certification agent or team to assess all of the security controls
                during the information system’s three-year accreditation cycle. Related security controls:
                CA-2, CA-4, CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.

CM-3      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

          Control: The organization authorizes, documents, and controls changes to the information system.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization manages configuration changes to the information system
          using an organizationally approved process (e.g., a chartered Configuration Control Board).
          Configuration change control involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation,
          test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the information system, including upgrades
          and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to the configuration settings
          for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, firewalls, routers). The organization
          includes emergency changes in the configuration change control process, including changes
          resulting from the remediation of flaws. The approvals to implement a change to the information
          system include successful results from the security analysis of the change. The organization audits
          activities associated with configuration changes to the information system. Related security
          controls: CM-4, CM-6, SI-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to: (i) document proposed changes to the
                information system; (ii) notify appropriate approval authorities; (iii) highlight approvals that have
                not been received in a timely manner; (iv) inhibit change until necessary approvals are received;
                and (v) document completed changes to the information system.

          Control: The organization monitors changes to the information system conducting security impact
          analyses to determine the effects of the changes.
          Supplemental Guidance: Prior to change implementation, and as part of the change approval
          process, the organization analyzes changes to the information system for potential security
          impacts. After the information system is changed (including upgrades and modifications), the
          organization checks the security features to verify that the features are still functioning properly.
          The organization audits activities associated with configuration changes to the information system.
          Monitoring configuration changes and conducting security impact analyses are important elements
          with regard to the ongoing assessment of security controls in the information system. Related

          technology products employed within the information system; (ii) configures the security settings
          of information technology products to the most restrictive mode consistent with operational
          requirements; (iii) documents the configuration settings; and (iv) enforces the configuration
          settings in all components of the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the configurable parameters of the information
          technology products that compose the information system. Organizations monitor and control
          changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
          OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for federal
          information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-70 provides guidance on producing and using
          configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational
          information systems. Related security controls: CM-2, CM-3, SI-4.

CM-7      LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

          Control: The organization configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities
          and specifically prohibits and/or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols,
          and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined list of prohibited and/or restricted functions,
          ports, protocols, and/or services].
          Supplemental Guidance: Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
          and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
          support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
          sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information
          system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
          Where feasible, the organization limits component functionality to a single function per device
          (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by information
          systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine
          which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol,
          Instant Messaging, File Transfer Protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, file sharing).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], to
                identify and eliminate unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

          Control: The organization develops, documents, and maintains a current inventory of the
          components of the information system and relevant ownership information.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate level of granularity for the
          information system components included in the inventory that are subject to management control
          (i.e., tracking, and reporting). The inventory of information system components includes any
          information determined to be necessary by the organization to achieve effective property
          accountability (e.g., manufacturer, model number, serial number, software license information,
          system/component owner). The component inventory is consistent with the accreditation
          boundary of the information system. Related security controls: CM-2, CM-6.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an integral part of
                component installations.

CP-9      INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP

          Control: The organization conducts backups of user-level and system-level information (including
          system state information) contained in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency] and protects backup information at the storage location.
          Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of
          backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the
          organization’s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. While integrity and
          availability are the primary concerns for system backup information, protecting backup
          information from unauthorized disclosure is also an important consideration depending on the type
          of information residing on the backup media and the FIPS 199 impact level. An organizational
          assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for backup information. The protection of system
          backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control. Related security controls:
          MP-4, MP-5.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify
                media reliability and information integrity.
          (2)   The organization selectively uses backup information in the restoration of information system
                functions as part of contingency plan testing.
          (3)   The organization stores backup copies of the operating system and other critical information
                system software in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the
                operational software.
          (4)   The organization protects system backup information from unauthorized modification.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs appropriate mechanisms (e.g.,
                digital signatures, cryptographic hashes) to protect the integrity of information system
                backups. Protecting the confidentiality of system backup information is beyond the scope of
                this control. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.

CP-10     INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

          Control: The organization employs mechanisms with supporting procedures to allow the
          information system to be recovered and reconstituted to a known secure state after a disruption or
          failure.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system recovery and reconstitution to a known secure state
          means that all system parameters (either default or organization-established) are set to secure
          values, security-critical patches are reinstalled, security-related configuration settings are
          reestablished, system documentation and operating procedures are available, application and
          system software is reinstalled and configured with secure settings, information from the most
          recent, known secure backups is loaded, and the system is fully tested.
          Control Enhancements:

IA-2      USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates users (or processes acting on
          behalf of users).
          Supplemental Guidance: Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than
          those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance security
          control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords,
          tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. NIST
          Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication including
          strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in
          Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems.
          Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information
          system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the
          Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an
          information system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g.,
          local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent
          control enhancement is specified, authentication for both local and remote information system
          access is NIST Special Publication 800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications
          800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the
          unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to
          identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system logon),
          identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
          necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
          In accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of
          public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
          privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with
          OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63
          compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the IA-2 control and its enhancements.
          Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to
          ensure ease of use for public access to such information and information systems with the need to
          protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals. Related security controls:
          AC-14, AC-17.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for remote system access that is NIST
                Special Publication 800-63 [Selection: organization-defined level 3, level 3 using a hardware
                authentication device, or level 4] compliant.
          (2)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for local system access that is NIST
                Special Publication 800-63 [Selection: organization-defined level 3 or level 4] compliant.
          (3)   The information system employs multifactor authentication for remote system access that is NIST

IA-3      DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The information system identifies and authenticates specific devices before establishing a
          connection.
          Supplemental Guidance: The information system typically uses either shared known information
          (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
          addresses) or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible
          Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          authentication) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. The
          required strength of the device authentication mechanism is determined by the FIPS 199 security
          categorization of the information system with higher impact levels requiring stronger
          authentication.

          Control: The organization manages user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying each user; (ii)
          verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user identifier from an
          appropriate organization official; (iv) issuing the user identifier to the intended party; (v) disabling
          the user identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; and (vi)
          archiving user identifiers.
          Supplemental Guidance: Identifier management is not applicable to shared information system
          accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-
          76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique
          identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors.

IA-5      AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization manages information system authenticators by: (i) defining initial
          authenticator content; (ii) establishing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
          distribution, for lost/compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
          (iii) changing default authenticators upon information system installation; and (iv)
          changing/refreshing authenticators periodically.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system authenticators include, for example, tokens, PKI
          certificates, biometrics, passwords, and key cards. Users take reasonable measures to safeguard
          authenticators including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or
          sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately.
          For password-based authentication, the information system: (i) protects passwords from
          unauthorized disclosure and modification when stored and transmitted; (ii) prohibits passwords
          from being displayed when entered; (iii) enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime
          restrictions; and (iv) prohibits password reuse for a specified number of generations. For PKI-
          based authentication, the information system: (i) validates certificates by constructing a
          certification path to an accepted trust anchor; (ii) establishes user control of the corresponding
          private key; and (iii) maps the authenticated identity to the user account. In accordance with OMB
          policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal
          information systems (and associated authenticator management) may also be required to protect
          nonpublic or privacy-related information. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and
          800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification
          and authentication of federal employees and contractors. NIST Special Publication 800-63
          provides guidance on remote electronic authentication.

IA-6      AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK

          Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the
          authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized
          individuals.
          Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from the information system does not provide information
          that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. Displaying
          asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication
          information.

          authentication to a cryptographic module.
          Supplemental Guidance:    The applicable federal standard for authentication to a cryptographic
          module is FIPS 140-2 (as amended). Validation certificates issued by the NIST Cryptographic
          Module Validation Program (including FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2, and future amendments) remain
          in effect, and the modules remain available for continued use and purchase until a validation

MA-2      CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE

          Control: The organization schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of routine
          preventative and regular maintenance (including repairs) on the components of the information
          system in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications and/or organizational
          requirements.
          Supplemental Guidance: All maintenance activities to include routine, scheduled maintenance and
          repairs are controlled; whether performed on site or remotely and whether the equipment is
          serviced on site or removed to another location. Organizational officials approve the removal of
          the information system or information system components from the facility when repairs are
          necessary. If the information system or component of the system requires off-site repair, the
          organization removes all information from associated media using approved procedures. After
          maintenance is performed on the information system, the organization checks all potentially
          impacted security controls to verify that the controls are still functioning properly.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization maintains maintenance records for the information system that include: (i) the
                date and time of maintenance; (ii) name of the individual performing the maintenance; (iii) name of
                escort, if necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) a list of equipment
                removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable).

MA-3      MAINTENANCE TOOLS

          Control: The organization approves, controls, and monitors the use of information system
          maintenance tools and maintains the tools on an ongoing basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address hardware and software brought into
          the information system specifically for diagnostic/repair actions (e.g., a hardware or software
          packet sniffer that is introduced for the purpose of a particular maintenance activity). Hardware
          and/or software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of
          the system (e.g., the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software
          implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not covered by this control.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization inspects all maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel
                for obvious improper modifications.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Maintenance tools include, for example, diagnostic and
                test equipment used to conduct maintenance on the information system.
          (2)   The organization checks all media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code
                before the media are used in the information system.
          (3)   The organization checks all maintenance equipment with the capability of retaining information so
                that no organizational information is written on the equipment or the equipment is appropriately
                sanitized before release; if the equipment cannot be sanitized, the equipment remains within the
                facility or is destroyed, unless an appropriate organization official explicitly authorizes an
                exception.
          (4)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict the use of maintenance tools to
                authorized personnel only.

MA-4      REMOTE MAINTENANCE

          Control: The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls any remotely executed maintenance
          and diagnostic activities, if employed.
          Supplemental Guidance: Remote maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals
          communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). The
          use of remote maintenance and diagnostic tools is consistent with organizational policy and
          documented in the security plan for the information system. The organization maintains records
          for all remote maintenance and diagnostic activities. Other techniques and/or controls to consider
          for improving the security of remote maintenance include: (i) encryption and decryption of
          communications; (ii) strong identification and authentication techniques, such as Level 3 or 4
          tokens as described in NIST Special Publication 800-63; and (iii) remote disconnect verification.
          When remote maintenance is completed, the organization (or information system in certain cases)
          terminates all sessions and remote connections invoked in the performance of that activity. If
          password-based authentication is used to accomplish remote maintenance, the organization
          changes the passwords following each remote maintenance service. NIST Special Publication
          800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security Agency provides a listing
          of approved media sanitization products at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm. Related
          security controls: IA-2, MP-6.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization audits all remote maintenance and diagnostic sessions and appropriate
                organizational personnel review the maintenance records of the remote sessions.
          (2)   The organization addresses the installation and use of remote maintenance and diagnostic links in
                the security plan for the information system.
          (3)   The organization does not allow remote maintenance or diagnostic services to be performed by a
                provider that does not implement for its own information system, a level of security at least as high
                as that implemented on the system being serviced, unless the component being serviced is
                removed from the information system and sanitized (with regard to organizational information)
                before the service begins and also sanitized (with regard to potentially malicious software) after
                the service is performed and before being reconnected to the information system.

MA-5      MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL

          Control: The organization allows only authorized personnel to perform maintenance on the
          information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Maintenance personnel (whether performing maintenance locally or
          remotely) have appropriate access authorizations to the information system when maintenance
          activities allow access to organizational information or could result in a future compromise of
          confidentiality, integrity, or availability. When maintenance personnel do not have needed access
          authorizations, organizational personnel with appropriate access authorizations supervise
          maintenance personnel during the performance of maintenance activities on the information
          system.

          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The media
          protection policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Media protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general,
          and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12

MP-2      MEDIA ACCESS

          Control: The organization restricts access to information system media to authorized individuals.

          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
          disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to portable and
          mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones).
          An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document in policy and
          procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media, and
          the specific measures taken to restrict access. The rigor with which this control is applied is
          commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the
          media. For example, fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information
          determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have
          limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than
          authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the
          media resides provide adequate protection.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict access to media storage areas and to
                audit access attempts and access granted.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is primarily applicable to
                designated media storage areas within an organization where a significant volume of media is
                stored and is not intended to apply to every location where some media is stored (e.g., in
                individual offices).

MP-3      MEDIA LABELING

          Control: The organization: (i) affixes external labels to removable information system media and
          information system output indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats and applicable
          security markings (if any) of the information; and (ii) exempts [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of media types or hardware components] from labeling so long as they remain within
          [Assignment: organization-defined protected environment].
          Supplemental Guidance: An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media
          requiring labeling. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring labeling
          and the specific measures taken to afford such protection. The rigor with which this control is
          applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained
          on the media. For example, labeling is not required for media containing information determined
          by the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.

MP-4      MEDIA STORAGE

          Control: The organization physically controls and securely stores information system media within
          controlled areas.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video
          disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or space for
          which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are
          sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information
          system. This control applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
          information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular
          telephones). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the
          capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone
          systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control
          mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel exercise
          extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems.
          An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring physical protection. Organizations document in policy and
          procedures, the media requiring physical protection and the specific measures taken to afford such
          protection. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199
          security categorization of the information contained on the media. For example, fewer protection
          measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the
          public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the
          organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is
          assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where the media resides provide adequate
          protection. The organization protects information system media identified by the organization
          until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.
          As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting
          information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. FIPS 199 security categorization guides
          the selection of appropriate candidates for secondary storage encryption. The organization
          implements effective cryptographic key management in support of secondary storage encryption
          and provides protections to maintain the availability of the information in the event of the loss of
          cryptographic keys by users. NIST Special Publications 800-56 and 800-57 provide guidance on
          cryptographic key establishment and cryptographic key management. Related security controls:

MP-5      MEDIA TRANSPORT

          Control: The organization protects and controls information system media during transport outside
          of controlled areas and restricts the activities associated with transport of such media to authorized
          personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          tapes, removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-
          digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or space for which the
          organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to
          meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system. This
          control also applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
          information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular
          telephones) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also
          considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal
          media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the
          identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other
          information systems, organizational personnel exercise extreme caution in the types of information
          stored on telephone voicemail systems that are transported outside of controlled areas. An
          organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring protection during transport. Organizations document in policy
          and procedures, the media requiring protection during transport and the specific measures taken to
          protect such transported media. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with
          the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the media. An organizational
          assessment of risk also guides the selection and use of appropriate storage containers for
          transporting non-digital media. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include
          individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or
          delivery service).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization protects digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas
                using [Assignment: organization-defined security measures, e.g., locked container, cryptography].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Physical and technical security measures for the
                protection of digital and non-digital media are approved by the organization, commensurate
                with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information residing on the media, and
                consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
                and guidance. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or integrity
                protections depending upon the mechanisms used.
          (2)   The organization documents, where appropriate, activities associated with the transport of
                information system media using [Assignment: organization-defined system of records].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations establish documentation requirements for
                activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with the
                organizational assessment of risk.
          (3)   The organization employs an identified custodian at all times to transport information system
                media.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations establish documentation requirements for
                activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with the

MP-6      MEDIA SANITIZATION AND DISPOSAL

          Control: The organization sanitizes information system media, both digital and non-digital, prior to
          disposal or release for reuse.
          Supplemental Guidance: Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information
          system media such that there is reasonable assurance, in proportion to the confidentiality of the
          information, that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
          including clearing, purging, and destroying media information, prevent the disclosure of
          organizational information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or disposed.
          The organization uses its discretion on sanitization techniques and procedures for media
          containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to
          have no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposed. NIST
          Special Publication 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security
          Agency also provides media sanitization guidance and maintains a listing of approved sanitization
          products at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and disposal actions.
          (2)   The organization periodically tests sanitization equipment and procedures to verify correct
                performance.

PE-3      PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

          Control: The organization controls all physical access points (including designated entry/exit
          points) to the facility where the information system resides (except for those areas within the
          facility officially designated as publicly accessible) and verifies individual access authorizations
          before granting access to the facility. The organization controls access to areas officially
          designated as publicly accessible, as appropriate, in accordance with the organization’s assessment
          of risk.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization uses physical access devices (e.g., keys, locks,
          combinations, card readers) and/or guards to control entry to facilities containing information
          systems. The organization secures keys, combinations, and other access devices and inventories
          those devices regularly. The organization changes combinations and keys: (i) periodically; and (ii)
          when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.
          Workstations and associated peripherals connected to (and part of) an organizational information
          system may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with access to such devices being
          appropriately controlled. Where federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential is used as
          an identification token and token-based access control is employed, the access control system
          conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publication 800-73. If the token-
          based access control function employs cryptographic verification, the access control system
          conforms to the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-78. If the token-based access
          control function employs biometric verification, the access control system conforms to the
          requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-76.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization controls physical access to the information system independent of the physical
                access controls for the facility.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement, in general, applies to server
                rooms, communications centers, or any other areas within a facility containing large
                concentrations of information system components or components with a higher impact level
                than that of the majority of the facility. The intent is to provide an additional layer of physical
                security for those areas where the organization may be more vulnerable due to the
                concentration of information system components or the impact level of the components. The
                control enhancement is not intended to apply to workstations or peripheral devices that are
                typically dispersed throughout the facility and used routinely by organizational personnel.

RA-3      RISK ASSESSMENT

          Control: The organization conducts assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result
          from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of
          information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency
          (including information and information systems managed/operated by external parties).
          Supplemental Guidance: Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and
          security controls planned or in place to determine the resulting level of residual risk posed to
          organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on the operation of the
          information system. The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and,
          in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives,
          potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system. Risk assessments also
          take into account risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
          from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf
          of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing
          entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication
          of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
          privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public
          access to federal information systems. The General Services Administration provides tools
          supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing with public access to federal information
          systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments
          including threat, vulnerability, and impact assessments.

          system are identified and reported.
          Supplemental Guidance: Vulnerability scanning is conducted using appropriate scanning tools and
          techniques. The organization trains selected personnel in the use and maintenance of vulnerability
          scanning tools and techniques. Vulnerability scans are scheduled and/or random in accordance
          with organizational policy and assessment of risk. The information obtained from the
          vulnerability scanning process is freely shared with appropriate personnel throughout the
          organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems. Vulnerability
          analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, more specialized approaches
          (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools for applications, source code reviews, static analysis of source
          code). NIST Special Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network security testing. NIST
          Special Publication 800-40 (Version 2) provides guidance on patch and vulnerability management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update
                the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned.
          (2)   The organization updates the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] or when significant new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.
          (3)   The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can demonstrate the breadth and
                depth of scan coverage, including vulnerabilities checked and information system components
                scanned.

          considerations and that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
          commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal,
          documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services acquisition
          policy and associated system and services acquisition controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The system and services acquisition policy and procedures are consistent
          with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          The system and services acquisition policy can be included as part of the general information
          security policy for the organization. System and services acquisition procedures can be developed
          for the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST
          Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.

          include, either explicitly or by reference, security requirements that describe: (i) required security
          capabilities (security needs and, as necessary, specific security controls and other specific FISMA
          requirements); (ii) required design and development processes; (iii) required test and evaluation
          procedures; and (iv) required documentation. The requirements in the solicitation documents
          permit updating security controls as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new
          technologies are implemented. NIST Special Publication 800-36 provides guidance on the
          selection of information security products. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on
          information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on
          security considerations in the system development life cycle.
          Information System Documentation
          The solicitation documents include requirements for appropriate information system
          documentation. The documentation addresses user and systems administrator guidance and
          information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information system. The
          level of detail required in the documentation is based on the FIPS 199 security category for the
          information system.
          Use of Tested, Evaluated, and Validated Products
          NIST Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on the acquisition and use of tested/evaluated
          information technology products.
          Configuration Settings and Implementation Guidance
          The information system required documentation includes security configuration settings and
          security implementation guidance. OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on
          configuration requirements for federal information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-70
          provides guidance on configuration settings for information technology products.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization requires in solicitation documents that appropriate documentation be provided
                describing the functional properties of the security controls employed within the information
                system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the controls.
          (2)   The organization requires in solicitation documents that appropriate documentation be provided
                describing the design and implementation details of the security controls employed within the

SA-5      INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

          Control: The organization obtains, protects as required, and makes available to authorized
          personnel, adequate documentation for the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance:   Documentation includes administrator and user guides with information
          on: (i) configuring, installing, and operating the information system; and (ii) effectively using the
          system’s security features. When adequate information system documentation is either
          unavailable or non existent (e.g., due to the age of the system or lack of support from the
          vendor/manufacturer), the organization documents attempts to obtain such documentation and
          provides compensating security controls, if needed.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization includes, in addition to administrator and user guides, documentation, if available
                from the vendor/manufacturer, describing the functional properties of the security controls
                employed within the information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the

          Control: The organization enforces explicit rules governing the installation of software by users.

          Supplemental Guidance: If provided the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install
          software. The organization identifies what types of software installations are permitted (e.g.,
          updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited
          (e.g., software that is free only for personal, not government use, and software whose pedigree
          with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect).

SA-8      SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

          Control: The organization designs and implements the information system using security
          engineering principles.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-27 provides guidance on engineering
          principles for information system security. The application of security engineering principles is
          primarily targeted at new development information systems or systems undergoing major
          upgrades and is integrated into the system development life cycle. For legacy information
          systems, the organization applies security engineering principles to system upgrades and
          modifications, to the extent feasible, given the current state of the hardware, software, and
          firmware components within the system.

SA-9      EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES

          Control: The organization: (i) requires that providers of external information system services
          employ adequate security controls in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders,
          directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and established service-level agreements; and
          (ii) monitors security control compliance.
          Supplemental Guidance: An external information system service is a service that is implemented
          outside of the accreditation boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that
          is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external
          service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures,
          business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements,
          lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately,
          the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization’s operations and assets, and to
          individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains with the
          authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust be
          established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with
          information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires
          that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service
          provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
          for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be
          established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs
          compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or
          to individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government,
          service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level
          agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required
          security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements
          for any identified instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides
          guidance on information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides
          guidance on the security considerations in the system development life cycle.

          evaluation plan, implement the plan, and document the results.
          Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security test results are used to the greatest extent feasible
          after verification of the results and recognizing that these results are impacted whenever there have
          been security relevant modifications to the information system subsequent to developer testing.
          Test results may be used in support of the security certification and accreditation process for the
          delivered information system. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4.

          Control:The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)
          from information system management functionality.
          Supplemental Guidance:  The information system physically or logically separates user interface
          services (e.g., public web pages) from information storage and management services (e.g.,
          database management). Separation may be accomplished through the use of different computers,
          different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network
          addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate.

SC-3      SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION

          Control:   The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.
          Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
          functions by means of partitions, domains, etc., including control of access to and integrity of, the
          hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. The information system
          maintains a separate execution domain (e.g., address space) for each executing process.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system employs underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate security
                function isolation.
          (2)   The information system isolates critical security functions (i.e., functions enforcing access and
                information flow control) from both nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.
          (3)   The information system minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the
                isolation boundary containing security functions.
          (4)   The information system security functions are implemented as largely independent modules that
                avoid unnecessary interactions between modules.
          (5)   The information system security functions are implemented as a layered structure minimizing
                interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the
                functionality or correctness of higher layers.

          Supplemental Guidance: Control of information system remnance, sometimes referred to as object
          reuse, or data remnance, prevents information, including encrypted representations of information,
          produced by the actions of a prior user/role (or the actions of a process acting on behalf of a prior
          user/role) from being available to any current user/role (or current process) that obtains access to a
          shared system resource (e.g., registers, main memory, secondary storage) after that resource has
          been released back to the information system.

SC-5      DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

          Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
          denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of denial of service
          attacks or reference to source for current list].
          Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
          effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
          types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network from being directly
          affected by denial of service attacks. Information systems that are publicly accessible can be
          protected by employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system restricts the ability of users to launch denial of service attacks against
                other information systems or networks.
          (2)   The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
                effects of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.

SC-7      BOUNDARY PROTECTION

          Control: The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary
          of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or information
          systems, occur through managed interfaces consisting of appropriate boundary protection devices
          (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels) arranged in an effective
          architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected
          subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). Information system boundary
          protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as
          that of the primary site.
          As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher-
          impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and applying the
          concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit network access in
          accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the
          selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning.
          The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial
          telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of
          such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network
          components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers,
          and may include third party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such
          interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract
          security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements
          appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on virtual private networks. Related security controls: MP-
          4, RA-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization physically allocates publicly accessible information system components to
                separate subnetworks with separate, physical network interfaces.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Publicly accessible information system components
                include, for example, public web servers.
          (2)   The organization prevents public access into the organization’s internal networks except as
                appropriately mediated.
          (3)   The organization limits the number of access points to the information system to allow for better
                monitoring of inbound and outbound network traffic.
          (4)   The organization implements a managed interface (boundary protection devices in an effective
                security architecture) with any external telecommunication service, implementing controls
                appropriate to the required protection of the confidentiality and integrity of the information being
                transmitted.
          (5)   The information system denies network traffic by default and allows network traffic by exception
                (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).
          (6)   The organization prevents the unauthorized release of information outside of the information
                system boundary or any unauthorized communication through the information system boundary
                when there is an operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms.

SC-8      TRANSMISSION INTEGRITY

          Control:   The information system protects the integrity of transmitted information.
          Supplemental Guidance: If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
          transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more
          difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security
          controls for transmission integrity. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
          security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
          the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly
          accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-52 provides guidance on protecting
          transmission integrity using Transport Layer Security (TLS). NIST Special Publication 800-77
          provides guidance on protecting transmission integrity using IPsec. NIST Special Publication
          800-81 provides guidance on Domain Name System (DNS) message authentication and integrity
          verification. NSTISSI No. 7003 contains guidance on the use of Protective Distribution Systems.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to recognize changes to information during
                transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Alternative physical protection measures include, for
                example, protected distribution systems.

          Supplemental Guidance:   If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
          transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more
          difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security
          controls for transmission confidentiality. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the
          necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting
          vehicles, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or
          explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-52 provides guidance on
          protecting transmission confidentiality using Transport Layer Security (TLS). NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on protecting transmission confidentiality using IPsec.

          Control: The information system that provides name/address resolution service provides additional
          data origin and integrity artifacts along with the authoritative data it returns in response to
          resolution queries.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control enables remote clients to obtain origin authentication and
          integrity verification assurances for the name/address resolution information obtained through the
          service. A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that
          provides name/address resolution service; digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples
          of additional artifacts; and DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. NIST Special

          performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the resolution responses it
          receives from authoritative sources when requested by client systems.
          Supplemental Guidance: A resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) server is an example of
          an information system that provides name/address resolution service for local clients and
          authoritative DNS servers are examples of authoritative sources. NIST Special Publication 800-81
          provides guidance on secure domain name system deployment.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on all
                resolution responses whether or not local clients explicitly request this service.

SC-22     ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

          Control: The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an
          organization are fault tolerant and implement role separation.
          Supplemental Guidance: A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information
          system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to
          enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS)
          servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are
          commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located
          in the same physical facility). If organizational information technology resources are divided into
          those resources belonging to internal networks and those resources belonging to external
          networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are established. The
          DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information pertaining to both
          internal and external information technology resources while the DNS server with the external role
          only provides name/address resolution information pertaining to external information technology
          resources. The list of clients who can access the authoritative DNS server of a particular role is
          also specified. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure DNS deployment.

          communications sessions.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus
          packet, level. The intent of this control is to implement session-level protection where needed
          (e.g., in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services). NIST Special Publication
          800-52 provides guidance on the use of transport layer security (TLS) mechanisms. NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on the deployment of IPsec virtual private networks (VPNs)
          and other methods of protecting communications sessions. NIST Special Publication 800-95

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization identifies information systems containing software
          affected by recently announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those
          flaws). The organization (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software developed and
          maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released security relevant patches,
          service packs, and hot fixes, and tests patches, service packs, and hot fixes for effectiveness and
          potential side effects on the organization’s information systems before installation. Flaws
          discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or
          information system error handling are also addressed expeditiously. Flaw remediation is
          incorporated into configuration management as an emergency change. NIST Special Publication

          Control: The information system implements malicious code protection.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms at critical
          information system entry and exit points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers,
          proxy servers, remote-access servers) and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices
          on the network. The organization uses the malicious code protection mechanisms to detect and
          eradicate malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware) transported: (i) by
          electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, removable media (e.g., USB
          devices, diskettes or compact disks), or other common means; or (ii) by exploiting information
          system vulnerabilities. The organization updates malicious code protection mechanisms
          (including the latest virus definitions) whenever new releases are available in accordance with
          organizational configuration management policy and procedures. The organization considers
          using malicious code protection software products from multiple vendors (e.g., using one vendor
          for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations). The organization also
          considers the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the
          resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system. NIST Special Publication
          800-83 provides guidance on implementing malicious code protection.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.
          (2)   The information system automatically updates malicious code protection mechanisms.

SI-4      INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

          Control: The organization employs tools and techniques to monitor events on the information
          system, detect attacks, and provide identification of unauthorized use of the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of
          tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious
          code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software).
          Monitoring devices are strategically deployed within the information system (e.g., at selected
          perimeter locations, near server farms supporting critical applications) to collect essential
          information. Monitoring devices are also deployed at ad hoc locations within the system to track
          specific transactions. Additionally, these devices are used to track the impact of security changes
          to the information system. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the
          organization based upon its monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to
          support such activities. Organizations consult appropriate legal counsel with regard to all
          information system monitoring activities. Organizations heighten the level of information system
          monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations,
          organizational assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information, intelligence
          information, or other credible sources of information. NIST Special Publication 800-61 provides
          guidance on detecting attacks through various types of security technologies. NIST Special
          Publication 800-83 provides guidance on detecting malware-based attacks through malicious code
          protection software. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on monitoring and
          analyzing computer security event logs. NIST Special Publication 800-94 provides guidance on
          intrusion detection and prevention. Related security control: AC-8.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization interconnects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into a
                systemwide intrusion detection system using common protocols.
          (2)   The organization employs automated tools to support near-real-time analysis of events.
          (3)   The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access
                control and flow control mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of
                these mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination.
          (4)   The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications for unusual or
                unauthorized activities or conditions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions include, for
                example, the presence of malicious code, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling
                to an external information system.
          (5)   The information system provides a real-time alert when the following indications of compromise or
                potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined list of compromise indicators].

SI-5      SECURITY ALERTS AND ADVISORIES

          Control: The organization receives information system security alerts/advisories on a regular basis,
          issues alerts/advisories to appropriate personnel, and takes appropriate actions in response.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization documents the types of actions to be taken in response to
          security alerts/advisories. The organization also maintains contact with special interest groups
          (e.g., information security forums) that: (i) facilitate sharing of security-related information (e.g.,
          threats, vulnerabilities, and latest security technologies); (ii) provide access to advice from security
          professionals; and (iii) improve knowledge of security best practices. NIST Special Publication
          800-40 provides guidance on monitoring and distributing security alerts and advisories.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information
                available throughout the organization as needed.

SI-6      SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

          Control: The information system verifies the correct operation of security functions [Selection (one
          or more): upon system startup and restart, upon command by user with appropriate privilege,
          periodically every [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]] and [Selection (one or more):
          notifies system administrator, shuts the system down, restarts the system] when anomalies are
          discovered.
          Supplemental Guidance: The need to verify security functionality applies to all security functions.
          For those security functions that are not able to execute automated self-tests, the organization
          either implements compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the risk of not performing
          the verification as required.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide notification of failed automated
                security tests.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support management of distributed security
                testing.

SI-7      SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

          Control: The information system detects and protects against unauthorized changes to software and
          information.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs integrity verification applications on the
          information system to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. The
          organization employs good software engineering practices with regard to commercial off-the-shelf
          integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and
          uses tools to automatically monitor the integrity of the information system and the applications it
          hosts.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization reassesses the integrity of software and information by performing [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] integrity scans of the system.
          (2)   The organization employs automated tools that provide notification to appropriate individuals upon
                discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.
          (3)   The organization employs centrally managed integrity verification tools.

SI-8      SPAM PROTECTION

          Control: The information system implements spam protection.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs spam protection mechanisms at critical
          information system entry points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, remote-access servers) and
          at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network. The organization uses the
          spam protection mechanisms to detect and take appropriate action on unsolicited messages
          transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, or other common
          means. Consideration is given to using spam protection software products from multiple vendors
          (e.g., using one vendor for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations).
          NIST Special Publication 800-45 provides guidance on electronic mail security.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization centrally manages spam protection mechanisms.
          (2)   The information system automatically updates spam protection mechanisms.

SI-9      INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS

          Control: The organization restricts the capability to input information to the information system to
          authorized personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: Restrictions on personnel authorized to input information to the
          information system may extend beyond the typical access controls employed by the system and
          include limitations based on specific operational/project responsibilities.
          Control Enhancements: None.

          Control: The information system checks information for accuracy, completeness, validity, and
          authenticity.
          Supplemental Guidance: Checks for accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of
          information are accomplished as close to the point of origin as possible. Rules for checking the
          valid syntax of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable
          values) are in place to verify that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs
          passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted
          as commands. The extent to which the information system is able to check the accuracy,
          completeness, validity, and authenticity of information is guided by organizational policy and
          operational requirements.
          Control Enhancements: None.

          Control: The information system identifies and handles error conditions in an expeditious manner
          without providing information that could be exploited by adversaries.
          Supplemental Guidance: The structure and content of error messages are carefully considered by the
          organization. Error messages are revealed only to authorized personnel. Error messages
          generated by the information system provide timely and useful information without revealing
          potentially harmful information that could be used by adversaries. Sensitive information (e.g.,
          account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers) are not listed in error logs or
          associated administrative messages. The extent to which the information system is able to identify
          and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.

SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS
RELATIONSHIP OF SECURITY CONTROLS TO OTHER STANDARDS AND CONTROL SETS




T
       he mapping table in this appendix provides organizations with a general indication of
       Special Publication 800-53 security control coverage with respect to other frequently
       referenced security control standards and control sets. 51 The security control mappings are
not exhaustive and are based on a broad interpretation and general understanding of the control
sets being compared. The mappings are created by using the primary security topic identified in
each of the Special Publication 800-53 security controls and associated control enhancements (if
any) and searching for a similar security topic in the other referenced security control standards
and control sets. Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the mapping
table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 17799 52
business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not exactly the same, functionality. In some
instances, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different context,
perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information flow
broadly in terms of assigned authorizations for controlling access between source and destination
objects, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 addresses the information flow more narrowly as it applies to
interconnected network domains. And finally, the following cautionary notes are in order:
•    The granularity of the security control sets being compared is not always the same. This
     difference in granularity makes the security control mappings less precise in some instances.
     Therefore, the mappings should not be used as a “checklist” for the express purpose of
     comparing security capabilities or security implementations across information systems
     assessed against different control sets.
•    Some of the control sets referenced in this appendix (e.g., Department of Defense Instruction
     8500.2) are organized into groups of security controls with each group reflecting different
     levels of protection. When the security control groups reflect a hierarchical enhancement of
     another group, only the paragraph reference from the lowest hierarchical group where the
     security topic first occurred is listed in the mapping column.

Organizations are encouraged to use the mapping table only as a starting point for conducting
further analyses and interpretation of control similarity and associated coverage when comparing
disparate control sets.




51
   The security control mapping table includes references to: (i) ISO/IEC 17799: 2005, Code of Practice for
Information Security Management; (ii) NIST Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for
Information Technology Systems; (iii) GAO, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual; (iv) Director of
Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 Policy and Manual, Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information within
Information Systems; and (v) Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation. The
designations in the respective columns indicate the paragraph identifier(s) or number(s) in the above documents where
the security controls, control objectives, or associated implementation guidance may be found.
52
  ISO/IEC 17799, Code of Practice for Information Security Management, is expected to be renamed to ISO 27002
consistent with the new designations for the ISO series of information security publications. ISO/IEC 17799 security
controls are also referenced in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Specification for an Information Security Management System.

   References in this column are to both DCI Directive 6/3 and to its Manual (Administrative update, December 2003).
Paragraphs cited from the Directive are preceded by “DCID” and where there are also references for the same control
from the Manual, these are preceded by “Manual.” Where only paragraph numbers appear, they are references to the
Manual. References to paragraphs in the Manual should be construed to encompass all subparagraphs related to those
paragraphs. It should also be noted that Special Publication 800-53 contains a set of security controls that cover
personnel, physical, and technical security measures, and therefore, the scope of the publication is broader than DCID
6/3. Some of the controls in Special Publication 800-53 are explicitly not included in DCID 6/3 because they are
addressed in other DCID and Intelligence Community (IC) policy documents. The difference in scope/breadth between
Special Publication 800-53 and DCID 6/3 impacts the degree of correlation between the two documents. Thus, the lack
of a “mapping” for a particular Special Publication 800-53 control to a DCID 6/3 requirement does not mean that there
is no similar IC requirement. The IC Translation Review Board provided information for the DCID 6/3 mapping.

APPENDIX H

STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE MAPPINGS
CROSSWALK BETWEEN NIST STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES AND SECURITY CONTROLS




T
       he mapping table in this appendix provides organizations with a two-way crosswalk
       between NIST security standards and guidance documents (i.e., the current version of the
       FIPS Publications and Special Publications in the 800- series) and the security controls in
the catalog of controls listed in Appendix F. The first crosswalk maps a specific NIST security
publication to the associated security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 that are
relevant to that publication. The second crosswalk maps each security control in Special
Publication 800-53 to the appropriate NIST standards and guidance documents that apply to that
particular control. 55 The purpose of the crosswalk is to provide organizations with additional
useful information regarding security control selection and implementation. The two-way
crosswalk between publications and security controls and security controls and publications is not
intended to be exhaustive. In addition to providing useful information for organizations, the
crosswalk also indicates particular areas where additional security guidance might be needed.




55
   There are certain FIPS and NIST Special Publications that are listed in the crosswalk for a particular security control
in Appendix H that do not appear in the supplemental guidance for that control. The supplemental guidance for
security controls lists only the most relevant NIST publications associated with that control or the publications that
provide the most extensive guidance for that security control area.

APPENDIX I

INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

    ndustrial control systems (ICS) 56 are information systems that differ significantly from

I   traditional administrative, mission support, and scientific data processing information
    systems. ICS typically have many unique characteristics—including a need for real-time
response and extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. These types of
specialized systems are pervasive throughout the critical infrastructure, often being required to
meet several and often conflicting safety, operational, performance, reliability, and security
requirements such as: (i) minimizing risk to the health and safety of the public; (ii) preventing
serious damage to the environment; (iii) preventing serious production stoppages or slowdowns
that result in negative impact to the Nation’s economy and ability to carry out critical functions;
(iv) protecting the critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and common human error; and (v)
safeguarding against the compromise of proprietary information. 57

Until recently, ICS had little resemblance to traditional information systems in that they were
isolated systems running proprietary software and control protocols. However, as these systems
have been increasingly integrated more closely into mainstream organizational information
systems to promote connectivity, efficiency, and remote access capabilities, they have started to
resemble the more traditional information systems. Increasingly, ICS use the same commercially
available hardware and software components as are used in the organization’s traditional
information systems. While the change in industrial control system architecture supports new
information system capabilities, it also provides significantly less isolation from the outside world
for these systems, introducing many of the same vulnerabilities that exist in current networked
information systems. The result is an even greater need to secure ICS.

FIPS 200, in combination with NIST Special Publication 800-53, requires that federal agencies
implement minimum security controls for their organizational information systems based on the
FIPS 199 security categorization of those systems. This includes implementing the minimum
baseline security controls described in NIST Special Publication 800-53 in ICS that are operated
by or on behalf of federal agencies. Section 3.3, Tailoring the Initial Baseline, allows the
organization 58 to modify or adjust the recommended security control baselines when certain
conditions exist that require that flexibility. NIST recommends that ICS owners take advantage
of the ability to tailor the initial baselines applying the ICS-specific guidance in this appendix.
This appendix also contains additions to the initial baselines that have been determined to be
generally required for ICS.




56
  An ICS is an information system used to control industrial processes such as manufacturing, product handling,
production, and distribution. Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICS are typically found in the
electric, water, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing
(automotive, aerospace, and durable goods) industries as well as in air and rail transportation control systems.

     See Executive Order 13231 on Critical Infrastructure Protection, October 16, 2001.
58
  NIST Special Publication 800-53 employs the term organization to refer to the owner or operator of an information
system. In this Appendix, organization may refer to the owner or operator of an ICS.

NIST has worked cooperatively with ICS communities in the public and private sectors to
develop specific guidance on the application of the security controls in Special Publication 800-
53 to ICS. That guidance, contained in this Appendix, includes ICS-specific:
•     Tailoring guidance;
•     Security control enhancements;
•     Supplements to the security control baselines; and
•     Supplemental guidance.

ICS Tailoring Guidance
Tailoring guidance for ICS can include scoping guidance and the application of compensating
security controls. Due to the unique characteristics of ICS, these systems may require a greater
use of compensating security controls than is the case for general purpose information systems.


    In situations where the ICS cannot support, or the organization determines it is not advisable
    to implement particular security controls or control enhancements in an ICS (e.g.,
    performance, safety, or reliability are adversely impacted), the organization provides a
    complete and convincing rationale for how the selected compensating controls provide an
    equivalent security capability or level of protection for the ICS and why the related baseline
    security controls could not be employed.
    If the ICS cannot support the use of automated mechanisms, the organization employs
    nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the
    general tailoring guidance in Section 3.3.
    Compensating controls are not exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls; rather, they are
    alternative safeguards and countermeasures employed within the ICS that accomplish the
    intent of the original security controls that could not be effectively employed. Organizational
    decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security plan for the
    ICS.



The security controls and control enhancements listed in Table I-1 are likely candidates for
tailoring (i.e., requiring the application of scoping guidance and/or compensating controls) with
regard to ICS. Note that the parenthetical numbers following the control identification refer to
control enhancements.

ICS Security Control Enhancements

ICS security control enhancements are augmentations to the original controls in Appendix F that
are required for certain ICS. The following ICS control enhancements extend the security control
catalog in Appendix F:
AC-3      ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
          ICS Control Enhancements:
          (ICS-1)   The ICS requires dual authorization, based on approved organizational procedures, to
                    privileged functions that have impacts on facility, public, and environmental safety.

                    ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization does not employ dual-approval
                    mechanisms when an immediate response is necessary to ensure public and
                    environmental safety.

CM-3      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL
          ICS Control Enhancements:
          (ICS-1)   The organization tests, validates, and documents changes (e.g., patches and updates) before
                    implementing the changes on the operational ICS.

                    ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that testing does not
                    interfere with ICS functions. The individual/group conducting the tests fully understands
                    the organizational information security policies and procedures, the ICS security policies
                    and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a
                    particular facility and/or process. A production ICS may need to be taken off-line, or
                    replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If an ICS must be taken
                    off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned ICS outages whenever
                    possible. In situations where the organization cannot, for operational reasons, conduct
                    live testing of a production ICS, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g.,
                    providing a replicated system to conduct testing) in accordance with the general tailoring
                    guidance.

In addition to the enhancements added for ICS in the table above, the security control supplement
process described in Section 3.4 is still applicable to ICS. Organizations are required to conduct a
risk assessment taking into account the tailoring and supplementing performed in arriving at the
agreed upon set of security controls for the ICS and the risk to the organization’s operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation being incurred by operation of the ICS
with the intended controls. The organization decides whether that risk is acceptable, and if not,
supplements the control set with additional controls until an acceptable level of risk is obtained.

ICS Supplemental Guidance

ICS Supplemental Guidance provides organizations with additional information on the
application of the security controls and control enhancements in Appendix F to ICS and the
environments in which these specialized systems operate. The Supplemental Guidance also
provides information as to why a particular security control or control enhancement may not be
applicable in some ICS environments and may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of
scoping guidance and/or compensating controls). ICS Supplemental Guidance does not replace
the original Supplemental Guidance in Appendix F. 59

ACCESS CONTROL

AC-2      ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Account management may include additional account types (e.g., role-
          based, device-based, attribute-based). The organization removes, disables, or otherwise secures
          default accounts (e.g., accounts used for maintenance) and changes default passwords. In
          situations where physical access to the ICS (e.g., workstations, hardware components, or field
          devices) predefines account privileges or where the ICS (e.g., certain remote terminal units,
          meters, or relays) cannot support account management, the organization employs appropriate
          compensating controls (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel security, intrusion
          detection, and auditing measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS (e.g., field devices) cannot
          support the use of automated mechanisms for the management of information system accounts, the
          organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-3      ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that access enforcement mechanisms do not
          adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS. NIST Special Publication 800-82
          provides guidance on ICS access enforcement.
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Within ICS, it is commonly the case that having access to
          specific devices (e.g., workstations, remote terminal units, field devices) is the equivalent to
          having privileged access; thereby restricting access to these devices is also restricting access to
          privileged functions and security-relevant information.



59
   In certain cases, the ICS-specific Supplemental Guidance developed during the ICS Security Project has applicability
to general purpose information systems. As such, the ICS-specific guidance in Appendix I that is generally applicable
to all information systems will be added to Appendix F during the next scheduled update to NIST Special Publication
800-53, Revision 3, projected for publication in December 2008.

AC-5      SEPARATION OF DUTIES

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the differentiation of roles
          or a single individual performs all roles within the ICS, the organization employs appropriate
          compensating controls (e.g., providing increased personnel security and auditing measures) in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-6      LEAST PRIVILEGE

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support differentiation of privileges
          or a single individual performs all roles within the ICS, the organization employs appropriate
          compensating controls (e.g., providing increased personnel security and auditing measures) in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-7      UNSUCCESSFUL LOGIN ATTEMPTS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support account/node locking or
          delayed login attempts, or the ICS cannot perform account/node locking or delayed logins due to
          significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs
          appropriate compensating controls (e.g., logging or recording all unsuccessful login attempts and
          alerting ICS security personnel though alarms or other means when the number of organization-
          defined consecutive invalid access attempts is exceeded) in accordance with the general tailoring
          guidance.

AC-8      SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support system use notification, the
          organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., posting physical notices in ICS
          facilities) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-10     CONCURRENT SESSION CONTROL

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support concurrent session control,
          the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased auditing
          measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-11     SESSION LOCK

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The ICS employs session lock to prevent access to specified
          workstations/nodes. The ICS activates session lock mechanisms automatically after an
          organization-defined time period for designated workstations/nodes on the ICS. In some cases,
          session lock for ICS operator workstations/nodes is not advised (e.g., when immediate operator
          responses are required in emergency situations). Session lock is not a substitute for logging out of
          the ICS. In situations where the ICS cannot support session lock, the organization employs
          appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel security,
          and auditing measures) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. NIST Special
          Publication 800-82 provides guidance on the use of session lock within an ICS environment.

AC-12     SESSION TERMINATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the automatic termination of
          remote sessions after a specified period of inactivity, or the ICS cannot automatically terminate
          remote sessions due to significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or reliability, the
          organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls (e.g.,
          providing increased auditing measures for remote sessions or limiting remote access privileges to
          key personnel) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.




APPENDIX I                                                                                              PAGE I-6

AC-13     SUPERVISION AND REVIEW — ACCESS CONTROL
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
          automated mechanisms for reviewing user activities, the organization employs nonautomated
          mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
          guidance.

AC-15     AUTOMATED MARKING

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support automated marking of
          output, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating
          controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AC-16     AUTOMATED LABELING

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support automated labeling of ICS
          information in process, in storage, or in transit, the organization employs nonautomated
          mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
          guidance.

AC-17     REMOTE ACCESS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Remote access to ICS locations (e.g., control centers, field locations) is
          only enabled when necessary, approved, and authenticated. NIST Special Publication 800-82
          defines and provides guidance on ICS remote access.
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
          automated mechanisms for monitoring and control of remote access methods, the organization
          employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls (e.g., following
          manual authentication [see IA-2 in this appendix], dial-in remote access may be enabled for a
          specified period of time or a call may be placed from the ICS site to the authenticated remote
          entity) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
          Control Enhancement: (2)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: ICS security objectives typically follow the priority of
          availability, integrity and confidentiality, in that order. The use of cryptography is determined
          after careful consideration of the security needs and the potential ramifications on system
          performance. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the use of
          cryptography would adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS. In situations where
          the ICS cannot support the use of cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and
          integrity of remote sessions, or the components cannot use cryptographic mechanisms due to
          significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs
          appropriate compensating controls (e.g., providing increased auditing measures for remote
          sessions or limiting remote access privileges to key personnel) in accordance with the general
          tailoring guidance.

AC-18     WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Wireless technologies include, but are not limited to, microwave,
          satellite, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth.
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: ICS security objectives typically follow the priority of
          availability, integrity and confidentiality, in that order. The use of cryptography is determined
          after careful consideration of the security needs and the potential ramifications on system
          performance. For example, the organization considers whether latency induced from the use of
          cryptography would adversely impact the operational performance of the ICS. In situations where
          the ICS cannot support the use of authentication or encryption to protect wireless access, or the
          components cannot use authentication or encryption due to significant adverse impact on
          performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls
          (e.g., providing increased auditing measures for wireless access or limiting wireless access) in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AWARENESS AND TRAINING

AT-2      SECURITY AWARENESS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Security awareness training includes initial and periodic review of ICS-
          specific policies, standard operating procedures, security trends, and vulnerabilities. The ICS
          security awareness program is consistent with the requirements of the security awareness and
          training policy established by the organization.

AT-3      SECURITY TRAINING

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Security training includes initial and periodic review of ICS-specific
          policies, standard operating procedures, security trends, and vulnerabilities. The ICS security
          training program is consistent with the requirements of the security awareness and training policy
          established by the organization.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

AU-2      AUDITABLE EVENTS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Most ICS auditing occurs at the application level. In situations where
          the ICS cannot support the use of automated mechanisms to generate audit records, the
          organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

AU-5      RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In general, audit record processing is not performed on the ICS, but on
          a separate information system. In situations where the ICS cannot support auditing including
          response to audit failures, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., providing an
          auditing capability on a separate information system) in accordance with the general tailoring
          guidance.

AU-7      AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In general, audit reduction and report generation is not performed on
          the ICS, but on a separate information system. In situations where the ICS cannot support
          auditing including audit reduction and report generation, the organization employs compensating
          controls (e.g., providing an auditing capability on a separate information system) in accordance
          with the general tailoring guidance.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION, AND SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

CA-2      SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization ensures that assessments do not interfere with ICS
          functions. The individual/group conducting the assessment fully understands the organizational
          information security policies and procedures, the ICS security policies and procedures, and the
          specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular facility and/or process.
          A production ICS may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before an
          assessment can be conducted. If an ICS must be taken off-line to conduct an assessment, the
          assessment is scheduled to occur during planned ICS outages whenever possible. In situations
          where the organization cannot, for operational reasons, conduct a live assessment of a production
          ICS, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., providing a replicated system to
          conduct the assessment) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

CA-4      SECURITY CERTIFICATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Assessments are performed and documented by qualified assessors
          (e.g., experienced in assessing ICS) authorized by the organization. External audits (e.g., audits
          conducted by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

CM-3      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-82 provides guidance on configuration
          change control for ICS.
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
          automated mechanisms to implement configuration change control, the organization employs
          nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general
          tailoring guidance.

CM-4      MONITORING CONFIGURATION CHANGES

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization considers ICS safety and security interdependencies.

CM-5      ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
          automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support auditing of enforcement actions,
          the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

CM-6      CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
          Control Enhancement: (1)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of
          automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify configuration settings, the
          organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance.

CM-7      LEAST FUNCTIONALITY

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization considers disabling unused or unnecessary physical
          and logical ports and protocols (e.g., universal serial bus [USB], PS/2, FTP) on ICS components to
          prevent unauthorized connection of devices (e.g., thumb drives).



APPENDIX I                                                                                               PAGE I-9

________________________________________________________________________________________________

CONTINGENCY PLANNING

CP-2      CONTINGENCY PLAN

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization defines contingency plans for categories of
          disruptions or failures. In the event of a loss of processing within the ICS or communication with
          operational facilities, the ICS executes predetermined procedures (e.g., alert the operator of the
          failure and then do nothing, alert the operator and then safely shut down the industrial process,
          alert the operator and then maintain the last operational setting prior to failure). These examples
          are not exhaustive. NIST Special Publication 800-82 provides guidance on ICS failure modes.

CP-4      CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING AND EXERCISES

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the organization cannot test or exercise the
          contingency plan on production ICS due to significant adverse impact on performance, safety, or
          reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls (e.g., using scheduled and
          unscheduled system maintenance activities including responding to ICS component and system
          failures, as an opportunity to test or exercise the contingency plan) in accordance with the general
          tailoring guidance.

CP-7      ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the organization cannot provide an alternate
          processing site, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls in accordance with
          the general tailoring guidance.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

IA-2      USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Where users function as a single group (e.g., control room operators),
          user identification and authentication may be role-based, group-based, or device-based. For
          certain ICS, the capability for immediate operator interaction is critical. Local emergency actions
          for ICS are not hampered by identification or authentication requirements. Access to these
          systems may be restricted by appropriate physical security controls. In situations where the ICS
          cannot support user identification and authentication, or the organization determines it is not
          advisable to perform user identification and authentication due to significant adverse impact on
          performance, safety, or reliability, the organization employs appropriate compensating controls
          (e.g., providing increased physical security, personnel security, and auditing measures) in
          accordance with the general tailoring guidance. For example, manual voice authentication of
          remote personnel and local, manual actions may be required in order to establish a remote access
          [see AC-17 in this appendix]. NIST Special Publication 800-82 provides guidance on ICS user
          identification and authentication.
          Control Enhancements: (1) (2) (3)

          ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Local and remote user access to ICS components is
          enabled only when necessary, approved, and authenticated. As defined in Appendix B, remote
          access refers to access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information
          system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. For ICS, the
          organization is the ICS owner/operator. Thus, remote access to the ICS is access from outside the
          system boundary defined by the ICS owner/operator. NIST Special Publication 800-82 defines
          and provides guidance on ICS remote access.

IA-3      DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: In situations where the ICS cannot support device identification and
          authentication (e.g., serial devices), the organization employs compensating controls in accordance
          with the general tailoring guidance.

IA-4      IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Where users function as a single group (e.g., control room operators),
          user identification may be role-based, group-based, or device-based. NIST Special Publication
          800-82 provides guidance on ICS identifier management.

IA-5      AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Many ICS devices and software are shipped with factory default
          authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. However, factory
          default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a great
          security risk, and therefore must be changed. Authentication may be role-based, group-based, or

PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

PE-3      PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization considers ICS safety and security interdependencies.
          The organization considers access requirements in emergency situations. During an emergency-
          related event, the organization may restrict access to ICS facilities and assets to authorized
          individuals only. ICS are often constructed of devices that either do not have or cannot use
          comprehensive access control capabilities due to time-restrictive safety constraints. Physical
          access controls and defense-in-depth measures are used by the organization when necessary and
          possible to supplement ICS security when electronic mechanisms are unable to fulfill the security
          requirements of the organization’s security plan. NIST Special Publication 800-82 provides
          guidance on ICS physical access control.

PE-4      ACCESS CONTROL FOR TRANSMISSION MEDIUM

RA-5      VULNERABILITY SCANNING

          ICS Supplemental Guidance: Vulnerability scanning tools are used with care on ICS networks to
          ensure that ICS functions are not adversely impacted by the scanning process. Production ICS
          may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before scanning can be
          conducted. If ICS are taken off-line for scanning, scans are scheduled to occur during planned
          ICS outages whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on non-ICS networks,
          extra care is taken to ensure that they do not scan the ICS network. In situations where the
          organization cannot, for operational reasons, conduct vulnerability scanning on a production ICS,
          the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., providing a replicated system to conduct
          scanning) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance. NIST Special Publication 800-82
          provides guidance on ICS vulnerability scanning.
