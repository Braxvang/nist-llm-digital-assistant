104   Abstract
105   This document summarizes research performed by the members of the NIST Cloud Computing
106   Forensic Science Working Group and presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference
107   Architecture (CC FRA, also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide
108   support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand
109   which cloud forensic challenges might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies
110   challenges that require at least partial mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would
111   apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA presented here is both a
112   methodology and an initial implementation. Users are encouraged to customize this initial
113   implementation for their specific situations and needs.

129   Call for Patent Claims
130   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
131   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
132   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
133   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
134   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
135   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
136   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
137   in written or electronic form, either:
138       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
139          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
140       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
141          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
142          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
143              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
144                    discrimination; or
145             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
146                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
147   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
148   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
149   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
150   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
151   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
152   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
153   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
154   Such statements should be addressed to: sp800-201@nist.gov

194   Executive Summary
195   The rapid adoption of cloud computing technology has led to the need to apply digital forensics
196   to this domain. New methodologies are required for the identification, acquisition, preservation,
197   examination, and interpretation of digital evidence in multi-tenant cloud environments that offer
198   rapid provisioning, global elasticity, and broad network accessibility. This is necessary to
199   provide capabilities for incident response, secure internal enterprise operations, and support for
200   the U.S. criminal justice and civil litigation systems.
201   This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA,
202   also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide support for a cloud
203   system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand the cloud forensic
204   challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies forensic challenges
205   that require mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply that to a particular
206   forensic investigation.
207   The CC FRA provides a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze the
208   impacts of cloud forensic challenges previously reported by NIST. It does so by considering each
209   cloud forensic challenge in the context of each functional capability presented in the Cloud
210   Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture.
211   While the CC FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed
212   to allow cloud system architects, cloud engineers, forensic practitioners, and cloud consumers to
213   ask specific questions related to their cloud computing architectures. The CC FRA is both a
214   methodology and an initial implementation, and users are encouraged to customize this initial
215   implementation for their specific situations and needs.

217       Introduction
218   The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) previously
219   published NIST IR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges [1], which was
220   the result of collaboration between volunteers from the private and public sector. That document
221   highlighted digital forensic challenges triggered by the specific characteristics and business
222   model of public cloud computing services.
223   The approach to examining digital forensics in the cloud was to first understand cloud computing
224   technology and to identify and elucidate its essential and unique characteristics, which play a
225   significant part in three aspects of operation: normal operations, adverse operations when cloud
226   computing resources are under attack, and operations during criminal exploitation.
227   The second phase of this approach was a close examination of the challenges that were identified
228   in the previous NIST report. This examination involved analyzing the Cloud Security Alliance’s
229   (CSA’s) Enterprise Architecture (EA) [2], its various functional capabilities and processes, and
230   the potential impact of each challenge on performing a forensic investigation if a specific
231   functional capability or process were involved in an attack and breach or were used during
232   criminal exploitation. The analysis presumed fictive use case scenarios that would exploit
233   potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, exposures, or cloud technology for criminal activities. Such
234   elements are of fundamental concern in forensic analysis as they present points that adversaries
235   may seek to exploit or characteristics that can be used by criminals. In either case, there will be
236   evidence of the attack or criminal exploitation for future forensic analysis. The EA is composed
237   of a large number of specific functional capabilities that enable detailed consideration of the
238   effects of each forensic challenge on each of the capabilities.
239   The third phase of this work has been to examine the nature of each challenge (i.e., whether the
240   challenge is technological or non-technological) to determine its role and impact on the forensic
241   examination process. As each challenge was analyzed, the applicability of techniques or
242   technologies became clearer in terms of how they function and ultimately contribute to the
243   forensic processes of identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, and interpretation of
244   evidence.
245   This work brings value by clarifying how forensics in the cloud can achieve the same acceptance
246   as forensics in traditional computing models. This document, the associated research, and NIST
247   IR 8006 [1] proactively address the White House Executive Order of May 12, 2021, entitled
248   Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity [3], which points out the importance
249   of having forensic-ready information systems, including cloud systems, to improve the Nation’s
250   cybersecurity.

251           The Need for a Cloud-specific Forensic Reference Architecture
252   Digital forensics is the application of science and technology to the discovery and examination of
253   digital artifacts within information systems and networks to establish facts and evidence
254   concerning events and conditions that occur within them. Digital forensics is traditionally used
255   for judicial proceedings and regulatory issues but may also be used for other purposes as
256   described below.
257   Digital forensics continues to evolve in step with computer and information science. As these
258   technologies, their implementations, and their operations have changed, digital forensics has

      February 2023                                                                    Reference Architecture

259   adapted. The number of scenarios that may require the application of digital forensic techniques
260   have increased along with the complexity of the underlying architectures .
261   One common scenario involves the detailed investigation of criminal activities. As computers
262   become widely available and develop greater capabilities, criminal elements worldwide have
263   adopted them as tools to manage their endeavors. These include both “traditional” forms of
264   crime (e.g., violent crime, property crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, white-collar
265   crime) and crimes that occur in cyberspace (e.g., ransomware attacks, data breaches, identity
266   theft, cyber-terrorism, distributed denial of service, illicit cryptocurrency mining, child
267   pornography, and attacks against governments, key corporations, or power grids). Forensic
268   procedures involve locating and analyzing digital traces that can help solve the crime and/or
269   allow for incident response.
270   Forensic procedures are also used to investigate civil actions, such as divorce proceedings, asset
271   discovery, insurance claims, lawsuits, and similar cases that often require forensic methods to
272   determine the presence, absence, and movement of data and funds.
273   An example of how forensic techniques are used involves the collection of a laptop computer
274   while apprehending a presumed perpetrator of an illegal act. The suspected act could involve –
275   for instance –financial exploitation of stolen identities, hacking into a hospital’s records
276   management system to implant ransomware, electronic entry of a corporate system in attempted
277   commercial espionage, or penetrating a government or military computer. Similarly, civil actions
278   can require forensic examination, such as discovering financial assets for a divorce proceeding.
279   In each of these cases, forensics plays an essential role in determining facts; assisting in the
280   analysis, validation, and authentication of data; and enabling documentation of findings to
281   present to a court and attorneys.
282   The application of forensic methods may also be required for normal business operations. For
283   example, forensic methods may be employed to recover data that, at first, appears to be lost or
284   destroyed on computer drives. During incident response, additional goals of using forensic
285   methods may include mitigating future cyberattacks, preventing system failure, or minimizing
286   data loss.
287   In the commercial context, the use of forensics in incident response can help determine the root
288   cause of an outage event, such as a component failure, corrupted software, or intentional
289   sabotage. Other scenarios may involve close examination of system configurations, potentially
290   questionable employee data storage and activities, and operational aspects related to compliance
291   matters. In any of these cases, forensic methods may supply insights that are not available
292   through any other means.
293   For decades, information processing systems have enabled the storage, processing, and
294   transmission of information for public and private organizations and individuals. The
295   maintenance, operations, and protection of these information systems have become paramount
296   concerns since a disruption of sufficient magnitude or specific type could threaten business
297   activities. In addition, the use of these systems in support of criminal activities has been of major
298   concern.
299   Industry and government have an array of authoritative sources that guide the design,
300   engineering, and operations of information systems. Each of the frameworks listed below can

302   information systems:
303       •   NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] – A focused guide to information system
304           risk management
305       •   ISO 27000 Series [5] – A series of standards dealing with a wide range of information
306           security topics, such as:
307           o ISO/IEC 27001 [6] – Information Security Management
308           o ISO/IEC 27002 [7] – Information Security Controls

310             Cloud
311           o ISO/IEC 27035 [9] – Incident Response
312           o ISO/IEC 27037 [10] – Digital Evidence Collection and Preservation
313       •   IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] – A service-oriented architecture (SOA)
314       •   Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12]
315       •   The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) [13] – A general security
316           framework
317       •   Cloud Security Alliance STAR program [14] – A progressive security certification
318   The focus of each of these frameworks varies but generally facilitates architecting,
319   implementing, and operating secure and resilient information systems. The RMF is focused on
320   security from a risk identification and management perspective. As varied as the ISO 27000
321   series [5] is, it contains standards that address digital evidence and incident response.
322   Interestingly, however, there is not a readily apparent, in-depth exploration of cloud-system
323   forensics.
324   The endeavor presented here deals with the matter of forensics performed within a cloud
325   computing environment. The advent of cloud computing has simplified business operations and
326   introduced a level of business agility not previously experienced with traditional or on-premises
327   computing. However, cloud computing has also introduced a range of security and forensics
328   challenges. Enhanced capabilities enjoyed by legitimate businesses and friendly governments are
329   often equally available to opposing nation-states, terrorist groups, and international criminal
330   elements and assets. As a result, targets that were once unassailable by nefarious actors may now
331   be vulnerable to attack or exploitation.
332   To a great extent, cloud computing runs on virtualization – that is, the creation of processing
333   resources that have hardware as their basis but run as multiplexed programs and are thus
334   functionally multiplied through it. Cloud forensics involves performing analysis on “virtual
335   machines” using techniques that rely on having “real machines” on which to work. In addition,
336   there is the issue of the information obtained. If the “machine” is essentially “unreal,” what does
337   that say about any evidence derived from it? This evidence is therefore different from traditional
338   digital evidence.
339   Cloud computing has become increasingly pervasive as more entities discover its advantages.
340   These entities include legitimate businesses, governments, and individuals who use SaaS cloud

341   platforms, as well as criminal and terrorist organizations and opposing nation-states. For
342   legitimate consumers, cloud computing provides capabilities such as:
343       •   More rapid business continuity and disaster recovery
344       •   More effective incident response
345       •   Improved information access, management, and archiving
346       •   Easier and more immediate collaboration between widely separated individuals and groups
347   This research has adapted solutions that originated in the on-premises data center to the
348   significant differences presented by the cloud.
349   As important as they are for addressing significant events related to business operations (as
350   described above), forensic methods have at least equal importance when contributing to matters
351   of compliance, legality, and criminal exploitation. Careful treatment has been given to these
352   questions during this research to ensure that the findings do not merely consider technical aspects
353   but also address the broader aspects of their material application. Unquestionably, close
354   examination of these adverse events is required to understand their incipience and progression
355   and – in particular – to ensure that remediation, event reconstruction, and attribution are
356   effectively and credibly realized.
357   Thus, it has been the specific focus and goal of this effort to research these issues, examine and
358   clarify the forensic challenges, and ultimately formulate and validate the capabilities required to
359   apply accepted forensic techniques and technologies to this unique computing environment. The
360   result is the Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture.
361   In as much as a security reference architecture is required to incorporate standards and
362   requirements that will inform system actualization and operation with respect to security,
363   applying the forensic reference architecture will likewise inform that system actualization and
364   operation with the capability to more effectively examine, understand, reconstruct, and remediate
365   the variety of system events and disruptions being experienced.
366   The goal of the CC FRA is to provide support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. It is meant
367   to help the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s
368   cloud system. It identifies which forensic challenges require mitigation strategies and how a
369   forensic investigator would apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA
370   presented here will likely evolve over time with more use and research.

371           The Approach
372   The CC FRA builds on several foundational layers. We begin with the understanding that this
373   reference architecture addresses forensics in the context of a cloud computing environment.
374   Building upon the fundamental relationship between security, incident response, and forensics,
375   the CC FRA is designed as an overlay to NIST SP 500-299/SP 800-200, NIST Cloud Computing
376   Security Reference Architecture (Draft) [15]. This document discusses the Security Reference
377   Architecture (SRA) and leverages the CSA’s Enterprise Architecture (EA). Section 3 provides
378   descriptions of the CSA’s EA and its use in the SRA, while Section 4 elaborates on the overlay
379   approach employed for the CC FRA.

386   The bottom layer in Figure 1 graphically represents the NIST cloud security reference
387   architecture (SRA). The middle layer represents the NIST cloud forensic challenges. The top
388   layer represents the NIST forensic reference architecture (FRA) described in the current
389   document as an overlay (subset) of the graphical representation of the CSA EA – more precisely,
390   the CSA TCI v1.1, which is the initial version of the CSA’s EA (see Appendix C).
391   In Figure 1, the FRA layer leverages the two layers graphically represented beneath it by
392   analyzing each capability of the SRA (these capabilities being derived from the CSA EA) in the
393   context of the challenges documented in NIST IR 8006 [1]. For each challenge, the analysis
394   determines whether the challenge affects the capability if implemented in a cloud environment as
395   part of a cloud service or solution. If the challenge affects the capability, then the functional
396   capability is considered to have forensic importance, and it is imported to or considered being a
397   capability of the FRA.

399       Overview of NIST Cloud Forensic Challenges
400   The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) was established to
401   research forensic science challenges and architectures related to the cloud environment. The
402   Working Group surveyed the literature and identified a set of challenges related to cloud
403   computing forensics. These challenges are presented in NIST IR 8006 [1], where each of 62
404   challenges is described along with potential results of overcoming each challenge. In addition,
405   the document provides a preliminary analysis of these challenges by including 1) the relationship
406   between each challenge and the five essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined in
407   the NIST cloud computing model [16]; 2) how the challenges correlate to cloud technology; and
408   3) nine categories to which the challenges belong. The analysis also considers logging data, data
409   in media, and issues associated with time, location, and sensitive data. In addition, the relevance
410   of topics such as rapid elasticity, multi-tenancy, and hypervisor/virtual machine layers is
411   discussed. These 62 challenges support the criminal justice and civil litigation systems, security
412   incident response, and internal enterprise operations.
413   The nine categories to which the challenges belong are reproduced below (from NIST IR 8006
414   [1], pp. 8-9):

415   1. Architecture (e.g., diversity, complexity, provenance, multi-tenancy, data segregation).
416      Architecture challenges in cloud forensics include:
417         a. Dealing with variability in cloud architectures between providers
418         b. Tenant data compartmentalization and isolation during resource provisioning
419         c. Proliferation of systems, locations, and endpoints that can store data
420         d. Accurate and secure provenance for maintaining and preserving chain of custody
421   2. Data collection (e.g., data integrity, data recovery, data location, imaging). Data collection
422      challenges in cloud forensics include:
423         a. Locating forensic artifacts in large, distributed, and dynamic systems
424         b. Locating and collecting volatile data
425         c. Data collection from virtual machines
426         d. Data integrity in a multi-tenant environment where data is shared among multiple
427             computers in multiple locations and accessible by multiple parties
428         e. Inability to image all of the forensic artifacts in the cloud
429         f. Accessing the data of one tenant without breaching the confidentiality of other tenants
430         g. Recovery of deleted data in a shared and distributed virtual environment
431   3. Analysis (e.g., correlation, reconstruction, time synchronization, logs, metadata, timelines).
432      Analysis challenges in cloud forensics include:
433         a. Correlation of forensic artifacts across and within cloud providers
434         b. Reconstruction of events from virtual images or storage
435         c. Integrity of metadata
436         d. Timeline analysis of log data, including synchronization of timestamps
437   4. Anti-forensics (e.g., obfuscation, data hiding, malware). Anti-forensics are a set of
438      techniques used specifically to prevent or mislead forensic analysis. Anti-forensic challenges
439      in cloud forensics include:
440          a. The use of obfuscation, malware, data hiding, or other techniques to compromise the
441             integrity of evidence

442           b. Malware may circumvent virtual machine isolation methods
443   5. Incident first responders (e.g., trustworthiness of cloud providers, response time,
444      reconstruction). Incident first responder challenges in cloud forensics include:
445          a. Confidence, competence, and trustworthiness of the cloud providers to act as first
446             responders and perform data collection
447          b. Difficulty in performing initial triage
448          c. Processing a large volume of collected forensic artifacts
449   6. Role management (e.g., data owners, identity management, users, access control). Role
450      management challenges in cloud forensics include:
451         a. Uniquely identifying the owner of an account
452         b. Decoupling between cloud user credentials and physical users
453         c. Ease of anonymity and creating fictitious identities online
454         d. Determining exact ownership of data
455         e. Authentication and access control
456   7. Legal (e.g., jurisdictions, laws, service level agreements, contracts, subpoenas, international
457      cooperation, privacy, ethics). Legal challenges in cloud forensics include:
458         a. Identifying and addressing issues of jurisdictions for legal access to data
459         b. Lack of effective channels for international communication and cooperation during an
460             investigation
461         c. Data acquisition that relies on the cooperation, competence, and trustworthiness of
462             cloud providers
463         d. Missing terms in contracts and service-level agreements
464         e. Issuing subpoenas without knowledge of the physical location of data
465   8. Standards (e.g., standard operating procedures, interoperability, testing, validation).
466      Standards challenges in cloud forensics include:
467         a. Lack of minimum/basic SOPs, practices, and tools
468         b. Lack of interoperability among cloud providers
469         c. Lack of test and validation procedures
470   9. Training (e.g., forensic investigators, cloud providers, qualification, certification). Training
471      challenges in cloud forensics include:
472         a. Misuse of digital forensic training materials that are not applicable to cloud forensics
473         b. Lack of cloud forensic training and expertise for both investigators and instructors
474         c. Limited knowledge about evidence by record-keeping personnel in cloud providers

      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

476       Overview of CSA’s Enterprise Architecture
477   The Cloud Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture (CSA’s EA) [2] is both a methodology
478   and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management
479   professionals to leverage a common set of solutions and controls. These solutions and controls
480   fulfill common requirements that risk managers must assess regarding the operational status of
481   internal IT security and cloud provider controls. These controls are expressed in terms of security
482   capabilities and designed to create a common roadmap to meet the security needs of businesses.
483   CSA designed the EA understanding that business requirements must guide the architecture. In
484   the case of the Enterprise Architecture, these requirements come from a controls matrix partly
485   driven by regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley [17] and Gramm-Leach-Bliley [18], standards
486   frameworks such as ISO-27002 [7], the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards [19],
487   and the IT Audit Frameworks such as COBIT [20], all in the context of cloud service delivery
488   models such as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a
489   service (IaaS).
490   From these requirements, a set of security capabilities have been defined and organized
491   according to the following best practice architecture frameworks. The Sherwood Applied
492   Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] defines a security model from a business
493   perspective. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] specifies the schema
494   needed to manage a company’s IT services, including the security guidelines to manage those
495   services securely. The Jericho Forum [21] designates technical security specifications that arise
496   from the reality of traditional technology environments in the data center and shift to one where
497   solutions span the internet across multiple data centers, some owned by the business and some
498   purely used as outsourced services. Lastly, The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
499   [13] provides an enterprise architecture framework and methodology for planning, designing,
500   and governing information architectures, concluding in a common framework to integrate the
501   work of the security architect with the enterprise architecture of an organization.
502   The CSA EA is reproduced in Appendix C, and the domains covered are:
503       1. Business Operation Support Services (BOSS) – These functional capabilities are
504          associated with cloud IT services that support an organization’s business needs. BOSS
505          embodies the direction of the business and objectives of the cloud consumer. BOSS
506          capabilities cover compliance, data governance, operational risk management, human
507          resources security, security monitoring, internal investigations, and legal services.
508       2. Information Technology Operation and Support (ITOS) – These functional capabilities
509          are associated with managing the cloud IT services of an organization. ITOS capabilities
510          cover IT operation, service delivery, and service support.
511       3. Security and Risk Management (S&RM) – These functional capabilities are associated
512          with safeguarding cloud IT assets and detecting, assessing, and monitoring cloud IT risks.
513          S&RM capabilities cover identity and access management, GRC (governance, risk
514          management, and compliance), policies and standards, threat and vulnerability
515          management, and infrastructure and data protection.
516       4. Presentation Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the end user
517          interacting with a cloud IT solution. The capabilities cover presentation modalities and

519       5. Application Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the development
520          and use of cloud applications provided by an organization. The capabilities cover
521          programming interfaces, security knowledge life cycle, development processes,
522          integration middleware, connectivity and delivery, and abstraction.
523       6. Information Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the storage and
524          use of cloud information and data. The capabilities cover service delivery, service
525          support, reporting services, information technology operation and support, business
526          operations and support, data governance, user directory services, risk management, and
527          security monitoring.
528       7. Infrastructure Services – These functional capabilities are associated with core functions
529          that support the cloud IT infrastructure. The capabilities cover facilities, hardware,
530          networks, and virtual environments.
531   Together, there are 347 functional capabilities within these domains.
532   As mentioned above, the CSA’s EA functional capabilities are leveraged by the NIST Cloud
533   Security Reference Architecture (SRA) [15], which is comprised of a formal model designed as a
534   security overlay to the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture [22] and a methodology
535   for architecting and orchestrating a cloud-based solution. The methodology allows cloud
536   architects to identify the system’s functional capabilities. The orchestration employs a risk-based
537   approach that follows the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] applied to cloud-based
538   systems.
539   The SRA’s risk-based approach for determining a cloud actor’s responsibilities for implementing
540   specific system components supports a clear delineation between the security responsibilities of
541   cloud providers and consumers and a clear understanding of the customer responsibility matrix.
542   Specifically, for each cloud service model, system components are analyzed to identify the level
543   of involvement of each cloud actor when implementing those components.

      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

545       The Forensic Reference Architecture Methodology
546   The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture introduced in this document aims to help
547   the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud
548   systems. When architecting or orchestrating a new cloud system, cloud architects and cloud
549   security and forensic practitioners are encouraged to use the CC FRA to identify which
550   challenges could impact the system and therefore require at least partial mitigation strategies to
551   minimize the risk incurred during operations by, for example, allowing real-time interventions
552   based on the proactively generated forensic data and to eliminate potential negative impacts on
553   digital forensic investigations if the need arises.
554   While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed to
555   help the following target audiences by finding answers for specific questions related to their
556   cloud computing architectures:
557       •   Target Audience #1: Cloud System Architects and Engineers. This target audience
558           might ask: “To what extent does the cloud system I’m designing facilitate the use of
559           digital forensics?” The architectural methodology and initial architecture presented in
560           this paper can help this audience identify where there could be potential challenges for
561           conducting forensics and can allow them to focus on areas of potential concern. System
562           trade-offs can be considered as well (e.g., the more that a system facilitates the use of
563           forensics, the greater the negative operational or economic impacts might be, or the
564           greater the chance that privacy might be impacted negatively).
565       •   Target Audience #2: Forensic Practitioners. This target audience might ask: “What
566           items do I need to be aware of to conduct digital forensics in the cloud environment
567           versus a traditional or on-premises computing environment?”
568       •   Target Audience #3: Consumers Who Want to Procure Cloud Services from Providers.
569           This target audience might ask: “What forensic questions and issues do I need to consider
570           when discussing what a cloud provider has to offer?”
571   The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture provides a useful starting point for all
572   cloud security and forensic stakeholders to analyze the extent to which the cloud forensic
573   challenges identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] are impacting their systems.
574   The 62 forensic challenges and 347 functional capabilities described in Section 2 and Section 3,
575   respectively, provide the basis for determining which capabilities are affected by each of the
576   challenges. All possible pairs of challenges and capabilities are considered. The capabilities help
577   focus possible mitigation efforts as follows. If a challenge affects a capability, there may be
578   mitigation approaches that can be used to perform better forensics with regard to that capability.
579   Such information could prove useful for forensic practitioners, developers, and researchers.
580   The NCC FSWG has developed a mapping between functional capabilities and forensic
581   challenges. For each functional capability, the mapping shows all of the forensic challenges that
582   affect that capability. This has resulted in a Mapping Table of 347 rows (one for each capability)
583   and 62 columns (one for each challenge). An entry in the table is YES if the associated challenge
584   affects the associated capability; otherwise, the entry is NO. (See Figure 3 for an excerpt of this
585   table.)

      February 2023                                                                     Reference Architecture

586   When the question is asked: does a forensic challenge affect a functional capability, it is defined
587   to mean: if the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic
588   investigation on the considered functional capability? This is the relationship that the mapping
589   between challenges and capabilities is attempting to capture.
590   To help answer this question, the NCC FSWG developed a summary for each of the 62 challenges.
591   This summary answers the following question for each specific challenge: What advantages would
592   be provided to a forensic investigator if this challenge were overcome (or mitigated)? If these
593   advantages imply that the quality of forensics that can be performed on the functional capability
594   could be improved, then the answer is YES, overcoming the challenge could make it easier to
595   perform a forensic investigation on the capability. The summaries for the 62 challenges are found
596   in NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 1.
597   The goal was to provide a narrow, precise mapping between challenges and capabilities. A
598   flowchart was developed that was followed to achieve this mapping, as shown in Fig. 2.

602   The flowchart provides users with a uniform method for determining the applicability of a
603   challenge to a particular capability. In conducting the analysis, the NCC FSWG placed each
604   cloud forensic challenge into one of two groups: 1) challenges that are primarily technical in
605   nature (e.g., architecture), or 2) challenges that are primarily non-technical in nature (e.g., legal).
606   This led to the creation of questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d in the flowchart, which perform
607   the placement into the two groups. If a challenge deals primarily with standards, legal issues,
608   contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training,
609   qualifications, or certifications, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is


                                                              12

      February 2023                                                                      Reference Architecture

610   considered technical. This grouping provides a simple and straightforward method for analyzing
611   the high-level characteristics of each challenge.
612   Similarly, the NCC FSWG placed each of the cloud functional capabilities into one of two
613   groups: 1) primarily technical or 2) primarily non-technical in nature. If a capability deals
614   primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues,
615   privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, then the capability is considered
616   non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. This led to the creation of questions Q3-a
617   and Q3-b.
618   The flowchart attempts to map challenges that are primarily technical only to capabilities that are
619   primarily technical and challenges that are primarily non-technical only to capabilities that are
620   primarily non-technical. This results in a precise and limited mapping. If a challenge and a
621   capability pair are assigned to the same group, the questioned is asked whether overcoming the
622   challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability. The answer determines whether
623   the capability is affected by the challenge. In summary, if the appropriate grouping is done and
624   overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered
625   to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES; otherwise, the mapping is NO).
626   There can, of course, be challenges in one group that affect capabilities in another group, but that
627   does not provide the precise, limited mapping. In such cases, the mapping is considered to be
628   NO.
629   The following is an example of what is meant by a precise, limited mapping. Suppose the
630   challenge deals with training (e.g., Challenge FC-65: There is a lack of training materials that
631   educate investigators on cloud computing technology and cloud forensic operating policies and
632   procedures; see [1], page 52). This is a non-technical challenge. In addition, suppose the
633   capability under consideration is technical. Enhanced training would clearly provide significant
634   benefit to forensic investigators and cloud providers because training is so broadly applicable
635   and would help to perform forensics more easily on most capabilities. However, a cloud forensic
636   architecture in which training affects almost every capability is undesirable because then the
637   architecture applies too broadly; most of the capabilities are not affected by this challenge in an
638   important way. This makes the architecture less useful because the architecture will have many
639   challenges that affect too many capabilities. Rather than this broad mapping of challenges to
640   capabilities, a narrower mapping is preferred. Narrowing the number of capabilities affected by
641   the challenge allows the mapping to be more powerful because the challenge can be used as an
642   effective tool of identifying the capabilities that are more likely to be affected by the challenge in
643   an important way. The architecture with a narrower mapping is also more practical because the
644   fewer YESs in the mappings, the easier for an investigator to apply the mappings in real-world
645   scenarios.
646   As described above and shown in Figure 2, if both the challenge and the capability being
647   evaluated deal with the same type of issue (i.e., technical or non-technical), then the following
648   question is asked: “If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud
649   forensic investigation on the functional capability?” If the answer is “yes,” then the mapping is
650   YES.
651   However, if the challenge is primarily technical in nature and the capability is non-technical in
652   nature (or vice versa), then an analysis is conducted to determine whether the use of technical or
653   non-technical solutions to implement the capability would significantly enhance the ability of a

      February 2023                                                                         Reference Architecture

654   forensic investigator to overcome the challenge, as illustrated in questions Q2-c and Q2-d. If the
655   answer to this question is “no,” then no further analysis is required. If the answer to question Q2-
656   c or Q2-d is “yes,” then the analysis will continue to determine: “If the challenge were overcome,
657   would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability?”
658   Using this methodology, it is possible to determine in a well-defined, structured fashion whether
659   it would be easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on a functional capability if the
660   forensic challenge were overcome. As a result, the flowchart will help cloud designers, forensic
661   investigators, and other interested parties focus specifically on those functional capabilities that
662   are affected by a specific cloud forensic challenge.
663   The process of traversing the flowchart involves asking questions about the particular challenge
664   and capability pair that is being analyzed. Starting at the top right of the flowchart (labeled “Q2-
665   a”), each box asks a question about the challenge or the capability. The answer to each question
666   – YES or NO – then leads to either another box with a question or to one of the circles shown in
667   Table 1.

                               the challenge DOES affect the capability.

                               the challenge DOES NOT affect the capability.

                               questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with a purple circle, then the
                               challenge DOES NOT affect the capability for reasons explained in
                               NOTE 1 and NOTE 2, below.
670
671   To determine whether the forensic challenge affects the functional capability, three fundamental
672   types of questions are asked:
673       1. Question 1 (Q1) – If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a
674          cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability? Note that the term “cloud
675          forensic investigation” means the identification, acquisition, preservation, examination,
676          interpretation, and reporting of potential digital evidence in the cloud. When analyzing
677          Question 1, it is narrowly considered only with regard to the particular functional
678          capability, ignoring all other capabilities as if they do not exist. So, the question really
679          asked is: If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud
680          forensic investigation on this functional capability only while ignoring other capabilities?
681       2. Question 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d) – These questions relate only to the challenges
682          and not capabilities. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the challenge
683          deals with technical or non-technical issues and if either technical solutions or non-
684          technical solutions significantly amplify the ability to overcome the challenge.

685       3. Question 3 (Q3-a and Q3-b) – These questions relate only to the capabilities and not the
686          challenges. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the capability deals
687          primarily with technical or non-technical issues.
688   Questions 2 and 3 ask about the issues that a challenge or capability deals with, which are
689   determined as follows. As discussed in Section 2, the NCC FSWG labeled each of the 62
690   challenges according to the following nine categories: architecture, data collection, analysis, anti-
691   forensics, incident first responders, role management, legal, standards, and training. The labels
692   for each challenge may be found in [1], Annex A, Table 2, in the columns labeled “Primary
693   Category” and “Related Category.” These categories and the challenge descriptions are used to
694   determine the type of issue each challenge deals with. If the primary issues are standards, legal
695   issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training,
696   qualification, or certification, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is
697   considered technical.
698   Similarly, if a capability deals primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service level
699   agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification,
700   then the capability is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical.
701   The NCC FSWG developed consensus answers for all of the questions related to Question 2 and
702   Question 3 in the flowchart. Therefore, when a particular challenge and capability pair was
703   considered, all questions – except for Question 1 – were already answered. This resulted in much
704   more consistent mappings across all challenges and capabilities.
705   When traversing the flowchart starting at the box labeled “Q2-a,” if a NO node is not reached,
706   then the box labeled “Q1” is eventually reached. For any challenge and capability pair, it may lie
707   in one of two groups when Q1 is reached (see Figure 2). As discussed above, Group 1 is the
708   “Technical Group,” and Group 2 is the “Non-technical Group.” They are defined as follows:

709   •   Group 1 (Technical Group) –

       [The challenge is technical, OR the
                                                         AND      [The functional capability is technical.]
       challenge is non-technical but requires
       technology (at least partially) to overcome
       the challenge.]
710

711   •   Group 2 (Non-Technical Group) –
712
       [The challenge is non-technical, OR the
       challenge is technical but requires non-                   [The functional capability is non-
       technical solutions (at least partially) to       AND
                                                                 technical.]
       overcome the challenge.]

713
714   The reason for these groups – to map technical challenges to technical capabilities and non-
715   technical challenges to non-technical capabilities – was explained above. Once a challenge and
716   capability pair is assigned to the appropriate group, the question of whether overcoming the



                                                         15

717   challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability is asked. This determines
718   whether the capability is affected by the challenge. If the grouping is appropriate and
719   overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered
720   to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES).
721   However, suppose a challenge is non-technical but requires technology to overcome the
722   challenge. Examples of non-technical challenges that have both non-technical and technical
723   solutions include the following ([1], Annex A):
724       •   FC-56 (Confidentially and PII) deals with legal/privacy issues (a non-technical
725           challenge). Privacy issues can be resolved with a combination of legal steps (e.g.,
726           legislation) and technology steps (privacy-enhancing technologies).
727       •   FC-64 and FC-65 deal with training (non-technical challenges). Training issues can be
728           resolved with better and more widely available training classes, but they can also be
729           resolved with better technology to perform the training.
730   There are non-technical challenges that require solutions that are non-technical, technical, or a
731   combination of both. If the non-technical challenge requires only a non-technical solution (and
732   the capability is non-technical), it is in Group 2. If it requires only a technical solution (and the
733   capability is technical), it is in Group 1. If it requires both, then it is in Group 1 or Group 2,
734   depending on whether the capability is technical or non-technical.
735   When a challenge is technical but requires a non-technical solution to overcome the challenge
736   (and the capability is non-technical), then this challenge is in Group 2.
737   In Fig. 2, the two purple circles refer to two notes, as follows:
738       •   NOTE 1: When this circle is reached, the challenge does not fit in either of the two
739           groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. Fortunately, none of the challenges reach
740           this node as none have this property. This node is included simply for logical
741           completeness of the flowchart, so that every node has both a YES exit path and a NO exit
742           path.
743       •   NOTE 2: When this circle is reached, the capability does not fit in either of the two
744           groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. There are a few capabilities that reach
745           this node. However, these capabilities do not deal with issues directly related to digital
746           forensics for cloud computing. Instead, they involve controlling physical access to
747           facilities (e.g., using barriers, security patrols, checking physical ID cards, etc.). They
748           also involve mitigating physical threats to facilities, such as installing fire suppression
749           equipment.
750   The process described in this section, which is employed for the analysis of any pair consisting
751   of a cloud functional capability and a cloud forensic challenge, represents a core component of

      February 2023                                                                                                          Reference Architecture

756           The Forensic Reference Architecture Data
757   The data that supplements the CC FRA methodology described in Section 4 represents the result
758   of an analysis performed by the NCC FSWG members. The methodology was applied to all
759   possible pairings of cloud forensic challenges (62 total challenges) with cloud functional
760   capabilities (347 capabilities). In total, 21,514 challenge-capability pairings were evaluated using
761   the flowchart in Figure 1.
762   All users of CC FRA data are encouraged to use the data as an initial implementation of the
763   methodology but use their own judgment when employing the CC FRA methodology in the
764   context of their cloud systems and modify or customize NIST’s initial dataset for their specific
765   situations and needs.
766   For example, if the existing capabilities are not appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all
767   can be removed, and new ones can be added. Similarly, new challenges appropriate for the user’s
768   situation can be added, or those challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed.
769   This architectural methodology has the advantage of helping to focus on how challenges can be
770   mitigated because it considers each challenge specifically in the context of affected capabilities.
771   The results of the NCC FSWG’s analysis are summarized in a Mapping Table (MT). An entry in
772   the MT is YES if the associated challenge was identified as affecting the paired capability.
773   Otherwise, the entry is NO.
774   The CC FRA data set provides all interested parties with the responses for every challenge-
775   capability pairing based on the analysis performed by the authors and collaborators of this
776   document. A sample excerpt of the table is displayed in Figure 3. The full CC FRA Mapping
777   Table is available for download (see Appendix D for a partial image and a link for downloading
778   the data).
779   The CC FRA data has 62 cloud forensic challenges obtained from NISTIR 8006 [1]. In the CC
780   FRA Mapping Table, each cloud forensic challenge is shown across the top row (i.e., Forensic
781   Challenge 1 [FC01], Forensic Challenge 2 [FC02], etc.). In Figure 3, only FC01-FC09 and
782   FC58-FC65 are shown, and the rest of the challenges are hidden for the sake of readability in the
783   figure. See Appendix D for the full Mapping Table.
784   The CC FRA data has 347 cloud functional capabilities. In the CC FRA Mapping Table, each
785   cloud functional capability is listed on the left column labeled “CAPABILITY” (see Figure 3).
786   The CC FRA data set preserves the grouping of the cloud functional capabilities provided by the
787   CSA EA [2] into “CONTAINERS” and “DOMAINS.”
788   In Figure 3, the first nine capabilities are shown, as are the last nine; the rest are hidden. Each
789   row, therefore, represents a separate capability and includes the following information: the
790   domain of the capability (all of the domains are described in Section 3), the container (the
791   highest-level elements within the architectural diagram in Appendix D 1), the name of the
792   capability, and a description of the capability (not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Appendix D).

          The container is a high-level collection of capabilities consisting of related processes and procedures within the domain.

794         Fig. 3. Excerpt of the Forensic Reference Architecture (Challenges vs. Capabilities Mapping Table).

795   The entry in the table that corresponds to a specific row and column (i.e., a specific challenge-
796   capability pair) is either YES or NO based on the result of traversing the mapping flowchart in
797   Figure 2. Traversing the flowchart requires answers to Questions 1 (Q1), 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c,
798   Q2-d), and 3 (Q3-a, Q3-b). As described in Section 4, Q1 must be answered for each individual
799   challenge-capability pair that reaches Q1 when the flowchart is traversed. However, Questions 2
800   and 3, which relate only to challenges and capabilities separately, can be answered ahead of time,
801   and consensus answers were developed for these by the NCC FSWG. These answers are shown
802   in the table in Figure 3. The second row in the table has the answers for Q2-a, the third row for
803   Q2-b, the fourth row for Q-2c, and the fifth row for Q2-d. The fifth column in the table has the
804   answers for Q3-a and the sixth column for Q3-b.
805   Each entry in the table is color-coded as follows:
806           •    Orange – A NO is obtained before reaching question Q1 in the flowchart. These entries
807                can be filled in automatically once the answers to questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, Q2-d, Q3-
808                a, and Q3-b are entered.
809           •    Red – A NO is obtained as a result of answering Q1.
810           •    Green – A YES is obtained as a result of answering Q1.

      February 2023                                                                       Reference Architecture

813   questions identified in the CC FRA methodology. Each challenge is further categorized based on
814   its overall impact on cloud functional capabilities. This categorization is focused on the overall
815   number of affected capabilities, identifying if only a limited set of capabilities is impacted versus
816   most capabilities composing the cloud ecosystem being impacted. The term impact is used to
817   indicate how broadly or narrowly a challenge affects the set of functional capabilities. Therefore,
818   the impact of each challenge was categorized along a generic-to-specific scale as follows (see
819   NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 2, column 4):
820       •   Generic (G) – A challenge is labeled generic if it affects most of the capabilities.
821       •   Specific (S) – A challenge is labeled specific if it affects a limited set of capabilities.
822       •   Quasi (Q) – A challenge is labeled quasi if it falls somewhere between generic and
823           specific.
824   A specific challenge applies narrowly and affects only a limited number of capabilities, while a
825   generic challenge affects a broad set of capabilities. The specific challenge affects a capability in
826   a direct manner that is determined by the particular issues addressed by the capability. This
827   results in the capability being affected in an important and profound way. On the other hand,
828   because the generic challenge affects most of the capabilities, the affect is not tied closely to the
829   issues addressed in each capability, and the capabilities are affected in a much less important and
830   profound way. (See Section 4 in which the “precise, limited mapping” is explained.) Thus, a
831   specific challenge is more impactful overall than a generic one when it comes to conducting a
832   cloud forensic investigation. The generic-to-specific label of each challenge is also part of the
833   Forensic Reference Architecture, as shown in Appendix D. The NCC FSWG developed
834   consensus labels for all of the challenges [1].

      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

836       Conclusion
837   This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA)
838   comprised of:
839       a) A methodology for analyzing the functional capabilities of an existing architecture –
840          preferably a security architecture like the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA’s) Enterprise
841          Architecture (EA) [2] – through a set of cloud forensic challenges, such as the set
842          identified in NIST IR 8006 [1]
843       b) A data set that aggregates the results of the above methodology applied to the CSA’s EA
844          [2] and the NIST IR 8006 [1] set of cloud forensic challenges
845   The goal of the FRA is to enable the analysis of cloud systems to determine the extent to which a
846   system proactively supports digital forensics. More precisely, the FRA is meant to help users
847   understand how the previously identified cloud forensic challenges might impact an
848   organization’s cloud-based system. When developing a new system or analyzing an existing one,
849   the FRA helps identify those cloud forensic challenges that could affect the system’s capabilities
850   and, therefore, require at least partial mitigation strategies to support a complete forensic
851   investigation. The FRA also identifies how a forensic investigator would apply the mitigation
852   strategies to a particular investigation. While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing
853   practitioner, it is specifically designed to enable cloud system architects, cloud engineers,
854   forensic practitioners, and even cloud consumers to analyze and review their cloud computing
855   architectures for forensic readiness.
856   The FRA data provided in this document offers an initial implementation of the FRA
857   methodology and a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze how the
858   NIST cloud forensic challenges presented in NIST IR 8006 [1] affect each functional capability
859   present in the CSA’s EA [2].
860   All users are encouraged to customize this initial implementation (shown in Appendix D) for
861   their specific situations and needs. For example, if the existing functional capabilities are not
862   appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all can be removed, and new ones can be added.
863   Similarly, new forensic challenges appropriate for the user’s situation can be added, and
864   challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. The FRA methodology
865   promotes analysis of how cloud forensic challenges affect particular functional capabilities and
866   helps determine whether mitigations are necessary to ensure forensic readiness related to the
867   respective capability. This means that users can replace all cloud forensics challenges or
868   functional capabilities used in the current FRA data set with their own.
869   The FRA presented here will likely evolve over time, and methods for quantifying impact will be
870   developed to enhance FRA usability.

1019   Appendix B. Glossary
1020   challenge
1021   For this paper, a currently difficult or impossible task that is either unique to cloud computing or exacerbated by it.

1022   cloud computing
1023   A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
1024   resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released
1025   with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential
1026   characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. [16]

1027   cloud consumer
1028   A person or organization that maintains a business relationship with and uses service from cloud providers. [22]

1029   cloud provider
1030   The entity (a person or an organization) responsible for making a service available to interested parties. [22,
1031   adapted]

1032   criminal exploitation
1033   The exploitation of computing resources by criminals. Criminal activities are planned and/or carried out using these
1034   computing resources.

1035   digital forensics
1036   The process used to acquire, preserve, analyze, and report on digital evidence using scientific methods that are
1037   demonstrably reliable, accurate, and repeatable such that it may be used in judicial proceedings. [23, adapted]

1038   flowchart
1039   A diagram that shows step-by-step progression through a process using boxes to show the steps and connecting
1040   arrows between the boxes to show their order.

1041   forensic investigator
1042   A person who is an expert in acquiring, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence from computers and
1043   other digital media. This evidence may be related to both computer-based and non-cybercrimes, including security
1044   threats, cyber-attacks, and other illegal activities.

1045   forensic readiness
1046   The ability to collect digital evidence effectively and quickly with minimal investigation costs. This involves being
1047   able to define the digital evidence required to reconstruct past computing events of interest.

1048   functional capability
1049   Cloud processes or solutions in the Cloud Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture that cover business operations,
1050   IT operations, security and risk management, presentation services, application services, information services, and
1051   infrastructure services. [2, adapted]

1052   incident response
1053   The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices. Addressing and managing the
1054   consequences of a security breach or cyberattack.

1055   mapping
1056   An operation that associates each element of a given set with one or more elements of a second set.

1057   security
1058   Measures and controls that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information processed and
1059   stored by a computer.




                                                                  25

1060   virtual machine
1061   A virtual data processing system that appears to be at the exclusive disposal of a particular user but whose functions
1062   are accomplished by sharing the resources of a real data processing system. [24]

1063   virtualization
1064   The simulation of the software and/or hardware upon which other software runs. This simulated environment is
1065   called a virtual machine. [25, adapted]




                                                                 26

1071   Appendix D. NIST’s Forensic Reference Architecture Data Set
1072   Section 5 of this document describes how the FRA methodology can be applied to analyze and
1073   review the functional capabilities of a cloud system by using a known set of forensic challenges
1074   to determine forensic readiness as related to these capabilities. To demonstrate its use, NIST
1075   provides an initial implementation of the FRA methodology by generating the FRA data set
1076   captured in the workbook available for download at the FRA’s GitHub repository or the NCC
1077   FSWG website. The workbook contains the summary of data analyzed by the NIST Cloud
1078   Computing Forensic Science Working Group using the FRA methodology that leverages NIST
1079   IR 8006, NIST Cloud Forensic Science Challenges, applied to the Cloud Security Alliance’s
1080   Enterprise Architecture. The FRA dataset can be found under the “Capabilities vs. Challenges
1081   Data” tab of the downloadable workbook.
