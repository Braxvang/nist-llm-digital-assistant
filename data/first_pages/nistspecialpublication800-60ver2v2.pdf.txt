The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law
107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing
adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not
apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130,
Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding
on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be
interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the
OMB, or any other Federal official.

This is Volume II of two volumes. It contains the appendixes to NIST Special Publication 800-60.
 NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 may be used by organizations in conjunction with an emerging family
of security-related publications including:
•     FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
      Systems (Pre-publication final), December 2003;
•     NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems
      (Second public draft), June 2003;
•     NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, (Initial public draft),
      October 2003.
•     NIST SP 800-53A, Techniques and Procedures for Verifying the Effectiveness of Security Controls in
      Information Systems (Initial public draft), Fall 2004;
•     NIST SP 800-59, Guidelines for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System, August
      2003; and
•     FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, (Projected for
      publication, Fall 2005)1
The series of seven documents, when completed, is intended to provide a structured, yet flexible framework for
selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security controls in Federal information systems—and
thus, make a significant contribution toward satisfying the requirements of the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. We regret that all seven publications could not be released
simultaneously. However, due to the current international climate and high priority of information security for
the Federal government, we have decided to release the individual publications as they are completed. While
the publications are mutually reinforcing and have some dependencies, in most cases, they can be effectively
used independently of one another.

The information types and security impact levels in Special Publication 800-60 are based on the OMB Federal
Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office Business Reference Model 2.0, inputs from participants
in NIST SP 800-60 workshops, and FIPS 199. Rationale for the example impact level recommendations
provided in appendixes have been derived from multiple sources, and as such, will require review,
comment, and modification to achieve consistency in terminology, structure, and content. The prerequisite
role played by security categorization in selection of SP 800-53 security controls, and the importance of
security controls in the protection of Federal information systems demands early exposure to the community
who will be employing those controls and thus, motivated the release of this document as the earliest
opportunity.

    FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, when published in 2005, will
     replace NIST Special Publication 800-53 and become a mandatory standard for Federal agencies in accordance
     with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), titled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop:
   •   Standards to be used by all Federal agencies to categorize all information and information
       systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives
       of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
   •   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be
       included in each such category; and
   •   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and
       technical controls), for information and information systems in each such category.

In response to the second of these tasks, this guideline has been developed to assist Federal
government agencies to categorize information and information systems. The guideline’s
objective is to facilitate provision of appropriate levels of information security according to a
range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure,
modification, or loss of availability of the information or information system. This guideline
assumes that the user is familiar with Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems (FIPS 199). The guideline and its appendixes:

   •   Review the security categorization terms and definitions established by FIPS 199;
   •   Recommend a security categorization process;
   •   Describe a methodology for identifying types of Federal information and information
       systems;
   •   Suggest provisional security impact levels for common information types;
   •   Discuss information attributes that may result in variances from the provisional
       impact level assignment; and
   •   Describe how to establish a system security categorization based on the system’s use,
       connectivity, and aggregate information content.

Types of information can normally be divided into information associated with administrative
activities common to most agencies and information associated with an agency’s mission-
specific activities. In this guideline, administrative, management, and support information is
referred to as management and support information. This guideline is less prescriptive for
mission-based information than for administrative and support information because there is
significantly less commonality of mission information types among agencies than is the case for
administrative and support information. While specific administrative and support information
types are identified in this guideline, the treatment of mission-based information focuses on
general guidelines for identification of information types and assignment of impact levels.




                                                 vii
(Examples of management and support impact assignments are discussed in Appendix C, and
examples of mission-based impact assignments are discussed in Appendix D.)

This document is intended as a reference resource rather than as a tutorial. Not all of the
material will be relevant to all agencies. This document includes two volumes: a basic guideline
and a volume of appendixes. Users should review the guidelines provided in Volume I, then
refer to only that specific material from the appendixes that applies to their own systems and
applications.

The provisional impact assignments contained in the appendixes are only the first step in impact
assignment and subsequent risk assessment processes. The impact assignments are not intended
to be used by auditors as a definitive checklist for information types and impact assignments.

The basis employed in this guideline for the identification of information types is the Office of
Management and Budget’s Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office’s June
2003 publication, The Business Reference Model Version 2.0 (BRM). The BRM describes
functions relating to the purpose of government (missions, or services to citizens), the
mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purpose (modes of delivery), the support
functions necessary to conduct government (support services), and the resource management
functions that support all areas of the government’s business (management of resources). The
information types associated with support services and management of resources functions are
treated as management and support types. (Although the OMB BRM is subject to revision from
time to time, not all BRM changes will result in changes to the information taxonomy employed
in this guideline.) Some additional information types have been added at the request of Federal
agencies. Appendix C recommends provisional confidentiality, integrity, and availability
information categories for each management and support information type and provides
rationale underlying the provisional impact levels. The information types associated with
services to citizens and modes of delivery functions are treated as mission-based information.
Recommended provisional impact levels, underlying rationale, and examples of rationale for
deviation from the provisional assignments for mission-based information types are provided in
Appendix D.

Some information has been established in law, by Executive Order, or by agency regulation as
requiring protection from disclosure. Appendix E addresses legal and executive sources that
establish sensitivity and/or criticality (These terms are defined in Appendix A.) characteristics
for information processed by Federal government departments and agencies. Individual citations
from the United States Code are listed in the appendix.

APPENDIX C: MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT INFORMATION AND
    INFORMATION SYSTEMS IMPACT LEVELS
Much Federal government information and many systems are not employed directly to provide
services to citizens, but are primarily intended to provide administrative or business services that
support mission accomplishment. Section 5, “Impact Levels by Type for Management and
Support Information,” suggests a set of information types for management and support
information and recommended provisional security categories. As stated in Section 5, the source
used for the identification of information types is the Office of Management and Budget’s
Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office June 2003 publication, The
Business Reference Model Version 2.0 (BRM).

Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of services or
manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in delivering services to
citizens. (See especially the “General Government” line of business.) Most of these information
types could be included in Appendix D as mission-based information types. Because the BRM
categorizes them as services delivery support functions, they are included in Section 5 and
Appendix C. In order to reduce repetition, they are not repeated in Appendix D.

Appendix C.1, “Recommended Provisional Impact Levels for Management and Support
Information Types,” documents impact levels for information types identified in Section 5.
These are provisional levels, subject to review and modification by agency stakeholders.
Provisional impact assignments are only the first step in impact assignment and are reviewed in
the subsequent risk assessment processes. They are not designed to be used by auditors as a
definitive checklist for information types and impact assignments.

Most information systems employed in both direct service and administrative/management
support activities perform one or more of the service delivery support functions described in
Appendix C.2, “Rationale and Factors for Services Delivery Support Information.” These
service support functions are the day-to-day activities necessary to the organizations that provide
services to the general population and administrative/management services to government
departments and agencies responsible for the provision of those services. As in the case of
administrative/business information and information systems, the security objectives and impacts
are determined by the direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported. It is
likely that all Federal government information systems store, process, and operate under the
control of information technology (IT) infrastructure maintenance information (e.g., password
files and file and network access settings). At least a basic set of security controls will apply to
this set of information and processes in order to combat potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of
system information and processes.

Information necessary to conduct administrative or business services that support mission
accomplishment includes the government resource management information types described in
Appendix C.3, “Rationale and Factors for Government Resource Management Information.” All




                                                 9
of the departments and agencies performing direct service functions are supported by
information systems that perform the activities described in Appendix C.3. Many departments
and agencies operate their own support systems. Others obtain at least some support services
from other organizations. Some agencies’ missions are primarily to support other government
departments and agencies in the conduct of direct service missions. As indicated above, security
objectives and impacts for administrative and management information and systems are
determined by the natures of the supported direct services and constituencies being supported.

Much of the discussion of factors affecting assignment of impact level is common to many
information types. Because this guideline is intended as a reference document, and it is
anticipated that most users will refer only to one or a few information types of interest, several
common or similar observations appear with each information type to which they are
appropriate. Some impact factors common to all information types are discussed in Section 3.5.

C.1 Recommended Provisional Impact Levels for Management and Support
   Information Types
Table 3 summarizes provisional impact level recommendations for administrative, management,
and service information.

Provisional impact levels are recommended for each security objective (confidentiality, integrity,
availability) for each management and support Federal government information type. The
confidentiality, integrity, and assurance impact levels define the security category of each
information type.

Most government information systems access, process, and/or disseminate more than one class
of information. Security objectives and impacts associated with all of the types of information
and processes served by the information system need to be considered in determining the
system’s information security requirements.

Each information type may include one or more elements. For example, benefits management
information includes employee identification information, benefit plan information for insurance
and other products, cost information, claims and reimbursement policy information, claims
procedures, etc.

In some cases, different impact levels are appropriate for different information elements. For
example, elements of program monitoring information relating to remediation of information
security vulnerabilities may have a different impact level than elements of program monitoring
information relating to an office furniture upgrade.

Each agency that processes an information type may process a distinct combination of elements.
The authority and responsibilities assigned to each agency that processes an information type can




                                                10
affect the actual impact level associated with the information within the context of that agency’s
operations.

In Table 3, the existence of exceptions to provisional impact assignments are flagged by
displaying impact assignments in a gray font [gray font].

Appendixes C.2 and C.3 identify information elements and contexts that may result in variances
from the basic impact level assignment. For example, some systems process information the
compromise of which affect national security, critical infrastructures, or key national assets.
Impacts associated with such systems are either outside the scope of this document (i.e., national
security information) or may need to be adjusted upward based on the more severe consequences
of compromises.

Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information that requires
protection at one stage in system development or operational use of the information is publicly
accessible at a later stage or following some event. For example, information that has
confidentiality attributes during the period that an agency is using it to make a decision may be
public knowledge once the decision has been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used
during development of requests for proposals in procurement actions).

C.2 Rationale and Factors for Services Delivery Support Information
Services delivery support functions provide the critical policy, programmatic, and managerial
foundation to support Federal government operations. Security objectives and impact levels for
service delivery support information and systems are generally determined by the natures of the
supported direct services and constituencies being supported. If a system stores, processes, or
communicates national security information, it is defined as a national security system, and is
outside the scope of this guideline.6 Service delivery support activities are defined in this
section.

C.2.1 Controls and Oversight

Controls and Oversight information is used to ensure that the operations and programs of the
Federal government and its external business partners comply with applicable laws and
regulations and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
C.2.1.1 Corrective Action Information Type

Corrective Action involves the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs that have
been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. The recommended security
categorization for the corrective action information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of corrective action
information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy internal or external programs that
have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure
of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or
information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. Such information will often
be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. The Privacy Act Information provisional

  A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated
by an agency or by a contractor on behalf of an agency, or any other organization on behalf of an agency – (i) the
function, operation, or use of which: involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to
national security; involves command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a
weapon or weapon system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a
routine administrative or business applications system used for applications such as payroll, finance, logistics, and
personnel management); or (ii) that processes classified information.




                                                         22
impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.
Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.
Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for corrective action information is low.
Integrity
The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of corrective action
information can conceivably compromise the effectiveness of compliance enforcement actions
(e.g., by providing violators with a basis for claiming investigative or enforcement irregularities,
thus supporting legal challenges to proposed corrective actions). The integrity impact level is
based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to
detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction
of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
corrective action information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the corrective action information. The
availability impact is also dependent on whether the data is time-critical. In most cases,
disruption of access to corrective action information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
corrective action information is low.
C.2.1.2 Program Evaluation Information Type

Program Evaluation involves the analysis of internal and external program effectiveness and the
determination of corrective actions as appropriate. The impact levels should be commensurate
with the impact levels of the program that is being evaluated. For example, if the program
contains very sensitive financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and
integrity, the program evaluation impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be
moderate. The recommended security categorization for the program evaluation information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     23
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to analyze internal and external program
effectiveness and to determine appropriate corrective actions. The confidentiality impact of
program evaluation information is largely event-driven. Once the evaluation has been reported,
most program evaluation information is in the public domain. However, premature unauthorized
disclosure of program evaluation information can alert personnel associated with programs under
evaluation to the focus and preliminary findings of investigative and evaluation activities.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where a major programs or human
safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation
information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact is high. Unauthorized disclosure of most program evaluation information
often has the potential to seriously affect agency operations. Also, some program evaluation
information, particularly in the case of current investigations, includes personal information
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 and/or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other
organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally, there are legislative
mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be
assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. If the program evaluation information is
moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Because there are many cases in which unauthorized
disclosure of program evaluation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for
program evaluation information is low.
Integrity
The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of program evaluation
information can compromise the effectiveness of an evaluation program (e.g., by providing false
information intended to mislead investigators or evaluators or to give program personnel a basis
for claiming investigative or evaluative irregularities). The integrity impact level is based on the
specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the
modification or destruction of information. Although there are time-sensitive exceptions,
unauthorized modification or destruction of most program evaluation information should have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
program evaluation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the program evaluation information.




                                                 24
Although there are time-sensitive exceptions, most program evaluation processes are tolerant of
reasonable delays. In most cases, disruption of access to program evaluation information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
program evaluation information is low.
C.2.1.3 Program Monitoring Information Type

Program Monitoring involves the data-gathering activities required to determine the
effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply with related
laws, regulations, and policies. The impact levels should be commensurate with the impact levels
of the programs that are being monitored. For example, if a program contains very sensitive
financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program
monitoring impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate. Subject to
exception conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the program
monitoring information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring
information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform data-gathering activities required to
determine the effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they
comply with related laws, regulations, and policies.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There are legislative mandates
prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a
moderate confidentiality impact level. Note that national security information and national
security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Otherwise, where the data being
collected belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality
impact assigned the data and system is that of the highest impact information type collected.
Unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information can alert personnel associated with
programs being monitored to the focus and implications of monitoring activities. Where a major
programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program
monitoring information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact is high. If the program monitoring information is moved to the public
domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Although there are many circumstances in which
serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to justify a
moderate base confidentiality impact level for program monitoring information, in most Federal
environments, unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect on agency




                                                     25
operations, assets, or individuals. Consequently, for most systems, a low provisional
confidentiality impact level is recommended for program monitoring information.
Integrity
The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring
information can compromise the effectiveness of the monitoring program. Although there may
be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, the integrity impact level is based on the
specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the
modification or destruction of information. The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized
modification or destruction of program monitoring information may have consequent serious
adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences can be particularly
serious if the destruction or modification of monitoring information invalidates evaluation results
concerning major programs or concerning threats to human safety. The integrity impact
resulting from unauthorized modification or deletion of program monitoring information depends
in part on the nature of the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and in
part on the criticality of the processes being monitored. For example, in the case of safety
regulations affecting manned space flight, the integrity impact level may be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: There are some regulatory environments in which a high or
moderate impact level is appropriate. For most compliance monitoring information, the
recommended provisional integrity impact level is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the program monitoring information.
Although there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, more typically, disruption
of access to program monitoring information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are a limited number of compliance
monitoring operations for which temporary loss of availability is likely to significantly degrade
mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in loss of major assets,
or pose a threat to human life. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such
information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
program monitoring information is low.

C.2.2 Regulatory Development

Regulatory Development involves activities associated with providing input to the
lawmaking process in developing regulations, policies, and guidance to implement laws.



                                                 26
C.2.2.1 Policy and Guidance Development Information Type

Policy and Guidance Development involves the creation and dissemination of guidelines to assist
in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. In most cases, the effect on public
welfare of a loss of policy and guidance development mission capability can be expected to be
delayed rather than immediate. As a result, the potential for consequent loss of human life or of
major national assets is relatively low, since these most catastrophic consequences of impairment
to mission capability can, in most cases, be corrected before they are fully realized. The
recommended security categorization for the policy and guidance development information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of policy and guidance
information on the ability of responsible agencies to create and disseminate guidelines to assist in
the interpretation and implementation of regulations. The confidentiality impact of policy and
guidance information is largely event-driven. Once a policy or guidance statement has been
promulgated, most policy and guidance information is in the public domain. However,
premature unauthorized disclosure of candidate policy and guidance material can result in
disruption of (and inappropriate influence of special interests on) the policy development
process.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality
of guidelines during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other
interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guideline development process.
Premature public release of formative policies and guidelines before internal coordination and
review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly
likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays can
impair an agency’s mission, but loss of public confidence can do serious and persistent harm to
an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. In such cases, the provisional
confidentiality impact level recommended for policy and guidance development information is
moderate. When the policy and guidance information is in the public domain, the confidentiality
impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Although there are cases in which unauthorized and
premature disclosure of policy and guidance information can result in serious consequences for
an agency, most of this information is intended to be available to the general public.
Consequently, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for policy and guidance
development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.



                                                     27
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some policy and guidance information is
time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications that contain policy and guidance development information (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences can be
expected to be much more serious in cases of agencies that have national defense, intelligence, or
information security missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity level recommended for policy and
guidance development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the policy and guidance development
information. Though some policy and guidance information is time-critical, the policy and
guidance development process is usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: the provisional availability impact level recommended for
policy and guidance development information is low.
C.2.2.2 Public Comment Tracking Information Type

Public Comment Tracking involves the activities of soliciting, maintaining, and responding to
public comments regarding proposed regulations. Subject to exception conditions described
below, the recommended security categorization for the public comment tracking information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public comment
tracking information on the ability of responsible agencies to solicit, maintain, and respond to
public comments regarding proposed regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality of
information associated with the public comment process is unlikely to pose the threat of serious
harm to agency assets, personnel or operations.

In a few cases, the rationale for public comments can include information that is sensitive in
terms of proprietary information sensitive Federal government information, or even national
security information. However, such cases are exceptional and the information in question
would be expected to be representative of information types covered elsewhere in this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for public comment tracking information is low.

Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain public comment tracking information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
public comment tracking information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the public comment tracking
information. The effects of disruption of access to public comment tracking information or
information systems can delay development of standards, guidelines, or regulations.

The public comment tracking process is usually tolerant of delays. Permanent loss of comment
information may disrupt some government operations by showing a lack of due diligence in
response to comments.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
public comment tracking information is low.
C.2.2.3 Regulatory Creation Information Type

Regulatory Creation involves the activities of researching and drafting proposed and final
regulations. Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended security
categorization for the regulatory creation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The level of confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of regulatory
creation information on the ability of responsible agencies to research and draft proposed and
final regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality of early drafts of regulations can result in
attempts by affected entities and other affected parties to influence and/or impede the regulation
development process.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Premature public release of draft
regulations before internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary
criticism of the proposed regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. In such
cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory creation



                                                     29
information is moderate. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays can impair an agency’s mission, but loss
of public confidence can do serious and persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively
perform its mission. If the regulatory information is moved to the public domain, the
confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Because most regulatory information is intended for
release to the public, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory
creation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain regulatory information (e.g., web
pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. The
consequences of a reduction in public confidence will be more serious for agencies that have
national defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact level
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
regulatory creation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the regulatory creation information.
The regulatory creation process is usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
regulatory creation information is low.
C.2.2.4 Rule Publication Information Type

Rule Publication includes all activities associated with the publication of a proposed or final rule
in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the rule publication information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of rule publication
information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish proposed or final rules in the



                                                     30
Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. The published rules are, by definition, public
information.

The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with the rule publication process
is unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency assets, personnel or operations.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In general, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for rule publication information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

In the worst cases, errata can be published. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information may result in unnecessary expenditures, some confusion, and limited damage to
public confidence in the agency.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for rule
publication information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the rule publication information.

Rule publication processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
rule publication information is low.

C.2.3 Planning and Resource Allocation

Planning and Resource Allocation involves the activities of determining strategic direction,
identifying and establishing programs and processes to enable change, and allocating
resources (capital and labor) among those programs and processes.
C.2.3.1 Budget Formulation Information Type

Budget Formulation involves all activities undertaken to determine priorities for future spending
and to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a targeted period
of time. This includes the collection and use of performance information to assess the
effectiveness of programs and develop budget priorities. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the budget formulation
information type is as follows:




                                                31
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of budget formulation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine priorities for future spending and
to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a targeted period of
time. Most budget information is supposed to be available to the public.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some budget information of is
classified national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. The effects of
loss of confidentiality of budget information or of early drafts of budgets can result in attempts
by competing interests to influence and/or impede the regulation development process. The
consequences to agency programs and even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can
be very serious. Premature public release of draft budgets before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed regulation and
even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where
the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays that result from
confidentiality compromise can imperil specific agency programs, but loss of public confidence
can do persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact level for budget formulation information is moderate. If the budget
formulation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes
Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In spite of the serious harm that can be suffered by an
agency due to unauthorized and premature disclosure of draft budget information (and associated
commentary), the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for budget formulation
information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some budget formulation information is
time-critical. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications that contain budget information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission
would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences will be more serious for agencies that
have national defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
budget formulation information is low.




                                                     32
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the budget formulation information.

Although some budget formulation information is time-critical, the budget formulation processes
are usually tolerant of delays. Excessive recovery delays may result in loss of funding.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
budget formulation information is low.
C.2.3.2 Capital Planning Information Type

Capital Planning involves the processes for ensuring that appropriate investments are selected for
capital expenditures. The recommended provisional security categorization for capital planning
information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of capital planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure that appropriate investments are
selected for capital expenditures. The effects of loss of confidentiality of capital investment
plans during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested
parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature
public release of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary
damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes
unedited internal commentary and discussion. The diversion of investment funds that can result
from compromise of draft plans can pervert investment priorities in a manner that is prejudicial
to public interest. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most capital planning
information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of
the background information that supports development of capital investment plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national
security activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be
moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).
Also, some capital investment plans of some Federal agencies contain national security
information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for capital planning information is low.

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of enterprise architecture
information on the ability of responsible agencies to describe the current state and define the
target state and transition strategy for an organizations people, processes, and technology. The
effects of loss of confidentiality of preliminary draft enterprise architecture plans can result in
attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy
and guideline development process. Premature public release of draft plans before internal
coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency.
This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and
discussion. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most enterprise architecture
information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.




                                                     34
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of
the background information that supports development of Federal enterprise architecture can
reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or
national security activities.7 Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality
impact can be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this

C.2.3.5 Budget Execution Information Type

Budget Execution involves day-to-day requisitions and obligations for agency expenditures,
invoices, billing dispute resolution, reconciliation, service level agreements, and distributions of
shared expenses. The recommended provisional security categorization for budget execution
information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of budget execution
information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage day-to-day requisitions and
obligations for agency expenditures, invoices, billing dispute resolution, reconciliation, service
level agreements, and distributions of shared expenses. The effects of loss of confidentiality of
most budget execution information are unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency
assets, personnel or operations. The consequence of loss of confidentiality of most budget
execution information is likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality
of budget execution information can violate privacy regulations, reveal information proprietary
to private institutions, and reveal procurement-sensitive information. In aggregate, budget
execution information can reveal capabilities and methods that some agencies (e.g., law
enforcement, homeland security, national defense, intelligence) consider extremely sensitive. In
these cases, the potential harm that can result from unauthorized disclosure ranges from
moderate to high to national security-related. In the last case, the information is outside the
scope of this document. Public release of sensitive budget execution information can result in
unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the
release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most budget execution information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Where small
dollar amounts are modified, the potential damage to an agency’s mission is limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of agreements or transactions
involving large monetary values, asset losses, and damage to agency operations, the potential for
serious loss of public confidence is high. The consequent integrity impact level is moderate to
high. If the budget execution information is time-critical or very sensitive, the integrity impact
level may be moderate or high.

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of management
improvement information on the ability of responsible agencies to gauge the ongoing efficiency
of business processes and identify opportunities for reengineering or restructuring. Premature
public release of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary
damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes
unedited internal commentary and discussion. However, the consequence of loss of
confidentiality of most management improvement information is likely to involve only limited
harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
background information that supports development of Federal management improvement plans
can reveal personnel-sensitive information, including information subject to the Privacy Act of
1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type. Other background information can reveal sensitive
vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security
activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be

not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain management improvement
information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public
confidence consequences can be expected to be more serious for agencies that have national
defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least
moderate. Failure to detect malicious modification of personnel information (mostly
background information) can result in disruption of some agency operations and disruptive
administrative or legal actions.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
management improvement information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the management improvement
information. The management improvement planning processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
management improvement information is low.

C.2.4 Internal Risk Management and Mitigation

Internal risk management and mitigation involves all activities relating to the processes of
analyzing exposure to risk and determining appropriate counter-measures. Note that risks to
much information and many information systems associated with many internal risk
management and mitigation activities may inherently affect the resistance to
compromise/damage and recovery from damage with respect to a broad range of critical
infrastructures and key national assets.
C.2.4.1 Contingency Planning Information Type

Contingency planning involves the actions required to plan for, respond to, and mitigate
damaging events. The recommended provisional security categorization for the contingency
planning information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}




                                                    40
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of contingency planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan for, respond to, and mitigate damaging
events. Unauthorized disclosure of contingency planning information may equip an adversary
with the information necessary to attack a system so that recovery is impaired.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal contingency plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods
employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some contingency plans are
themselves national security information. However, the purpose of most contingency planning
information is to protect against inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against
malicious attacks. Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, the case of hostile
attacks on systems must be considered. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts
from contingency plans are likely to have negligible to limited adverse effects on agency
operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at most, low. Unauthorized
disclosure of the entire plan to malicious entities may have serious effects. As a result, the
consequence of loss of confidentiality of comprehensive contingency plans is likely to involve
serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions. In such cases, the confidentiality
impact would be, at least, moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for contingency planning information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Errors in
contingency plans that result from integrity compromise can result in serious consequences to
system recovery capabilities. These can range from incorrect telephone numbers and e-mail
addresses on notification lists to erroneous schedules and file designations for database back-ups
and archives or software baselines, updates, and patches.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
contingency planning information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the contingency planning information.
The effects of disruption of access to contingency planning information or information systems
depend on the timing of the disruption. If access to contingency planning information is denied

because of a power outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies
disrupted.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The contingency planning processes are
usually tolerant of delays. In contrast, the contingency plan implementation process is not
tolerant of delays. The consequences of disruption of access to contingency planning
information depend on both the period of the outage and the criticality of the disrupted processes.
The consequent impact level may range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
contingency planning information is moderate.
C.2.4.2 Continuity of Operations Information Type

Continuity of operations involves the activities associated with the identification of critical
systems and processes, and the planning and preparation required to ensure that these systems
and processes will be available in the event of a catastrophic event. The recommended
provisional security categorization for the continuity of operations information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of continuity of
operations information on the ability of responsible agencies to identify critical systems and
processes, and to conduct the planning and preparation required to ensure that these systems and
processes will be available in the event of a catastrophic event. Unauthorized disclosure of the
entire plan to malicious entities may have serious effects. As a result, the consequence of loss of
confidentiality of most continuity of operations plans (and comprehensive continuity of
operations plans) is likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal continuity of operations plans can
reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or
methods employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending
on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve
national security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Unauthorized disclosure of
continuity of operations information for critical infrastructures and key national assets may
require a high impact level. However, the purpose of most continuity of operations information
is to protect against inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against malicious
attacks. Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, hostile attacks on systems must be
considered.

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts from continuity of operations plans are
likely to have negligible to limited adverse effects on agency operations. In such cases, the




                                                    42
confidentiality impact would be, at most, low. Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of
operations information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities and processes are
considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an adversary with the
information necessary to attack a system so that operations are disrupted, and that recovery is
impaired. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at least, moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for continuity of operations information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Errors in
continuity of operations plans that result from integrity compromise can result in serious
consequences to system recovery capabilities. These can range from incorrect telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses on notification lists to erroneous version numbers for database
back-ups and archives or software baselines, updates, and patches.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
continuity of operations information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the continuity of operations
information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The effects of disruption of access to
continuity of operations information or information systems depend on the timing of the
disruption. If access to continuity of operations information is denied because of a power
outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted. The continuity
of operations planning process is usually tolerant of delays. In contrast, the continuity of
operations implementation process is not tolerant of delays. The consequences of disruption of
access to continuity of operations information depend on both the period of the outage and the
criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent impact level will range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
continuity of operations information is moderate.
C.2.4.3 Service Recovery Information Type

Service recovery involves the internal actions necessary to develop a plan for resuming
operations after a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake. The recommended provisional
security categorization for the service recovery information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     43
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of service recovery
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop plans for resuming operations after
a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake. In the case of service recovery plans for
natural catastrophes, the information associated with service recovery planning is not
intrinsically sensitive. In the case of catastrophes caused by malicious activity, unauthorized
disclosure of service recovery information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities and
processes are considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an
adversary with the information necessary to attack a system in such a way that operations are
disrupted, and that recovery is impaired or even blocked. The purpose of most service recovery
information is to protect against natural catastrophes rather than against malicious attacks. In
most cases, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of service recovery information is not
likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal service recovery plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods
employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some service recovery plans are
themselves national security information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for service recovery information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
service recovery information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the service recovery information. The
effects of disruption of access to service recovery information or information systems depend on
the timing of the disruption. If access to service recovery information is denied because of a
power outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Service recovery planning processes are
usually tolerant of delay. In contrast, the implementation of recovery plans is not tolerant of
delays. For service recovery implementation, the consequences of access disruption depend on




                                                 44
the time period of the disruption and the criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent
impact level may range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
service recovery information is low.

C.2.5 Revenue Collection

Revenue Collection includes the collection of Government income from all sources. Note: Tax
collection is accounted for under the Taxation Management information type in the General
Government mission area.
C.2.5.1 Debt Collection Information Type

Debt Collection supports activities associated with the collection of money owed to the United
States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The recommended security
categorization for debt collection information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and efficiently collect money owed
to the United States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of debt collection information are generally dependent on the identity of
the debtor and of the nature and value of the debt being collected. Typically, unauthorized
disclosure of debt collection information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will commonly be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974,
information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization, or information that is
politically sensitive by a foreign government. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such
information will often be associated with debt collection processes. Where the amount of the
debt is significant, and unauthorized knowledge might imperil successful collection, then the
associated confidentiality impact assigned to debt collection information might be moderate (or
even high in the case of extremely high dollar value cases).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for debt collection information is moderate.




                                                     45
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Therefore, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of debt collection information depend
on the type of property being managed and on the immediacy with which the information is
expected to be used.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the modified or destroyed information is
substantive financial data, there is a greater potential for harm to result from actions being taken
based on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on individual
financial actions with consequent loss of revenue from, or other unanticipated consequences
regarding the personal property under disposition. The severity of the consequences depends on
the type of the debt and of the debtor but would be most likely be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for debt
collection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the debt collection information.

Most Federal debt collection processes are tolerant of delays. Also, the consequences of
temporary inability to access information concerning foreign or domestic debt will be minimal.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
debt collection information is low.
C.2.5.2 User Fee Collection Information Type

User fee Collection involves the collection of fees assessed on individuals or organizations for
the provision of Government services and for the use of Government goods or resources (i.e.
National Parks). The recommended security categorization for the user fee collection
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of user fee collection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to correctly and efficiently enforce, regulate,
and effect the collection of fees assessed on individuals or organizations for the provision of
Government services and for the use of Government goods or resources. In general, particularly
in aggregate, this information is public record.




                                                     46
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The recommended provisional confidentiality impact
level for user fee collection information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. For example,
there may be some circumstances when the unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee
collection information is undertaken as part of a scheme to divert payments, conceal
underpayment of failure to make payment of fees, or otherwise defraud the government. In
addition, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee collection
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy
with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be
needed urgently or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications might have an adverse effect on agency
operations, image and reputation. The integrity impact level assigned may be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for user
fee collection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the user fee collection information.
The missions supported by user fee collection information are generally tolerant of delay.
However, any extended period of unavailability would likely be seriously disruptive to the
operations for which fees are collected.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
user fee collection information is moderate.
C.2.5.3 Federal Asset Sales Information Type

Federal Asset Sales encompasses the activities associated with the acquisition, oversight,
tracking, and sale of non-internal assets managed by the Federal Government with a commercial
value and sold to the private sector. The recommended security categorization for the Federal
asset sales information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset sales
information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and efficiently acquire, oversee,
track, and sell non-internal assets managed by the Federal Government with a commercial value



                                                     47
and sold to the private sector. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset
sales information are generally dependent on the nature and value of the property being disposed.
Generally, Federal asset sales information is public. Most managed property would not be of
sufficient individual value to occasion such an occurrence (bid rigging, etc.).

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized knowledge
regarding the property being disposed of might lead to unfair advantage (i.e., ability to accurately
bid on an auction lot to the detriment of other bidders), then the associated confidentiality impact
assigned to Federal asset sales information might be moderate. Such an instance might arise if a
disruption of the proper procedures could reasonably cause an adverse effect on future operations
of the responsible agency, or if the agency’s image, or individual reputations might be damaged.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for Federal asset sales information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of Federal asset sale information is
partially dependent on the type of property being managed and whether the data is time-critical.
If the modified or destroyed information is substantive financial data, actions that are taken
based on incomplete or false information could have serious adverse effects on individual
financial actions.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, solicitations for bid, official notices of disposition, etc.) may adversely affect
the operations, image or reputation of an agency. However, the damage to the management
mission would usually be of more immediate concern. The severity of the consequent integrity
impact depends on the nature of the property but would be most likely be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
Federal asset sales information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the Federal asset sale information. The
missions supported by Federal asset sale information are generally tolerant of delay. Generally,
the consequences of temporary inability to access solicitations for bid, official notices of
disposition, etc., will be minimal.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
Federal asset sale information is low.




                                                 48
C.2.6 Public Affairs

Public Affairs activities involve the exchange of information and communication between
the Federal Government, citizens and stakeholders in direct support of citizen services, public
policy, and/or national interest.
C.2.6.1 Customer Services Information Type

Customer Service supports activities associated with providing and managing the delivery of
information and support to the government’s customers. The recommended security
categorization for the customer service information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of customer service
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide and manage the delivery of
information and support to the government’s customers. Most customer service information is
likely to be in the public domain and poses no confidentiality impact. In most cases,
unauthorized disclosure of customer service information will have at most a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some customer service information
may include customer-provided information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of
1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of
information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on
public confidence in the agency. Actions taken that are intended to establish blame, compensate
victims, or repair damage done with the exposed information can cause serious disruption of an
agency’s mission capability. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for customer service information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Typically, the
adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of customer service information on
overall agency mission functions or public confidence in the agency are limited. The more
serious integrity impacts become increasingly likely as E-government initiatives progress.
Typically, the unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) will result in limited adverse affect on
operations or public confidence in the agency and the damage to most missions would usually be
limited.




                                                     49
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: An increasing proportion of customer
service activities are interactive. Consequently, there is a potential for customer actions being
taken based on modified or incomplete information. Similarly, unauthorized modification or
deletion of customer-supplied information can result in government mishandling of interactions
with customers. If this occurs on a large-scale serious damage to public confidence in the
agency may result. In such cases, a moderate integrity may be associated with customer service
information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
customer service information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the customer service information. The
effects of disruption of access to or use of customer service information can usually be In
addition, customer service operations are not typically tolerant of delay. Even temporary loss of
availability of customer service information is likely to disrupt customer operations. In most
cases, disruption of access to customer service information can be expected to have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most outages will result in only
limited adverse effects on government operations, repeated outages can have a serious adverse
effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the availability impact might be
moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
customer service information is low.
C.2.6.2 Official Information Dissemination Information Type

Official Information Dissemination includes all efforts to provide official government
information to external stakeholders through the use of various types of media, such as video,
paper, web, etc. The recommended security categorization for the official information
dissemination information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of official information
dissemination information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide official Federal
government information to external stakeholders through the use of various communications
media. Official information dissemination information is usually in the public domain and poses
no confidentiality impact.




                                                     50
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for official information dissemination information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In general, the
adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of official information dissemination
information on overall agency mission functions will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There is a potential for customer actions
taken based on modified or incomplete information. In addition, unauthorized modification or
destruction of official information dissemination information may result in distribution of false
and misleading information (e.g., modified web pages, electronic mail, video). Such events can
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade
the official information dissemination mission capability. In such cases, a moderate integrity
impact may exist. Also, the more serious integrity impacts become increasingly likely as E-
government initiatives progress.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
official information dissemination information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the official information dissemination
information. Official information dissemination processes are generally tolerant of limited
delays. However, even temporary loss of availability of official information dissemination
information is likely to have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. In most cases,
disruption of access to official information dissemination information can be expected to have
only a limited adverse effect on overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will result in only
limited consequences, repeated outages can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in
the agency. This can significantly degrade the official information dissemination mission
capability. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
official information dissemination information is low.
C.2.6.3 Product Outreach Information Type

Product Outreach relates to the marketing of government services products, and programs to the
general public in an attempt to promote awareness and increase the number of




                                                  51
customers/beneficiaries of those services and programs. The recommended security
categorization for the product outreach information type is as follows:

C.2.7 Legislative Relations

Legislative Relations involves activities aimed at the development, tracking, and amendment
of public laws through the legislative branch of the Federal Government.
C.2.7.1 Legislation Tracking Information Type

Legislation Tracking involves following legislation from conception to adoption. The
recommended security categorization for the legislation tracking information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislation tracking
information on the ability of responsible agencies to follow legislation from conception to
adoption. Legislation tracking information itself is usually in the public domain and poses no
confidentiality impact.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, internal
correspondence associated with legislation tracking information can contain information, that if
improperly disclosed, will have a serious adverse effect on agency relationships with other
agencies and with the legislative branch. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact
level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislation tracking information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of legislation tracking
information on overall agency mission functions will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislation tracking information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislation tracking information.
Legislation tracking processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption




                                                     54
of access to legislation tracking information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislation tracking information is low.
C.2.7.2 Legislation Testimony Information Type

Legislation Testimony involves activities associated with providing testimony/evidence in
support or, or opposition to, legislation from conception to adoption. Subject to exception
conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the legislation
testimony information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislation testimony
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide testimony/evidence in support or, or
opposition to, legislation from conception to adoption. Most testimony regarding legislation is in
the public domain, and even premature release should result in no more than limited harm to
agency assets, personnel, or operations.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality
of some information applicable to pending testimony may result in attempts by competing
interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process. The consequences to agency
programs and of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature
public release of draft testimony before internal coordination and review has been conducted can
result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed testimony and damage public confidence in the
agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal
commentary and discussion. The results of unauthorized disclosure of information to the public
can imperil specific agency programs, but a consequent loss of public confidence can do
persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. This can result in
assignment of a moderate impact level to such information. Some information associated with
legislative testimony is classified national security information and is outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislation testimony information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.




                                                     55
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
testimony associated with legislation (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
inter-agency relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency.
However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislation testimony information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislation testimony information.
The legislation testimony processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislation testimony information is low.
C.2.7.3 Proposal Development Information Type

Proposal Development involves drafting proposed legislation that creates or amends laws subject
to Congressional legislative action. Subject to exception conditions described below, the
recommended security categorization for the proposal development information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of proposal development
information on the ability of responsible agencies to draft proposed legislation that creates or
amends laws subject to Congressional legislative action. Legislation is normally in the public
domain. However, the effects of loss of confidentiality of background information used in the
development of proposed legislation or of early drafts of proposed legislation could result in
attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process. The
consequences to agency programs and of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be
very serious. Premature public release of proposed legislation before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed legislation and
even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where
the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized
disclosure of much legislative proposal information, particularly in early phases of the process, is
likely to result in serious harm to agency assets or operations.




                                                     56
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some proposal development
information used by specific Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law enforcement,
defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive or classified national security information.
National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level
recommended for the very sensitive information is high. If the proposal development
information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not
Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In order to accommodate event-driven consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of pre-release drafts, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for proposal development information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
proposed legislation (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) might adversely affect inter-agency
relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency. However, damage to
the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
proposal development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the proposal development information.
Proposal development processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
proposal development information is low.
C.2.7.4 Congressional Liaison Information Type

Congressional Liaison Operations involves all activities associated with supporting the formal
relationship between a Federal Agency and the U.S. Congress. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the Congressional liaison
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     57
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of Congressional liaison
information on the ability of responsible agencies to support their formal relationships with U.S.
Congress. The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with Congressional
liaison can facilitate attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific
legislative process or poison inter-branch relations. The consequences to agency programs and
even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature public
release of information associated with Congressional liaison before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the preliminary data or
positions, and even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are
particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. In
general, unauthorized disclosure of much Congressional liaison information is likely to result in
serious harm to agency assets and/or operations. If the Congressional liaison information is
moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some Congressional liaison
information used by Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law enforcement, defense,
intelligence community) is very sensitive or even classified national security information.
National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level
associated with the very sensitive information is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for Congressional liaison information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
Congressional liaison information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the Congressional liaison information.
Congressional liaison processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
Congressional liaison information is low.




                                                 58
C.2.8 General Government

General Government involves the overhead costs of the Federal Government, including
legislative and executive activities; provision of central fiscal, personnel, and property activities;
and the provision of services that cannot reasonably be classified in any other service support
area. As a normal rule, all activities reasonably or closely associated with other service support
areas or information types shall be included in those service support areas or information types
rather than listed as a part of general government. This service support area is reserved for
central government management operations; most service delivery (mission-based) management
activities would not be included here. Unlike the other service support functions, some general
government information types are associated with specific organizations (e.g., Department of the
Treasury, Executive Office of the President, Internal Revenue Service).
C.2.8.1 Central Fiscal Operations Information Type

Central Fiscal Operations includes the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury
performs on behalf of the Government.8 [Note: Tax-related functions are associated with the
Taxation Management information type.] Impacts to some information and information systems
associated with central fiscal operations may affect the security of the critical banking and
finance infrastructure. In most cases, the effect on public welfare of a loss of central fiscal
operations functionality can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. The potential for
consequent loss of human life or of major national assets is low. . The provisional security
categorization recommended for the central fiscal operations information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central fiscal
operations information on the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury performs on
behalf of the Government. The effects of loss of confidentiality can reasonably be expected to
jeopardize relationships and administrative actions necessary to mission fulfillment and/or to
seriously damage public confidence in the agency. For example, the unauthorized disclosure of
investigative and enforcement information can have serious economic impact on both individual
companies and the broader market place (e.g., short-term stock market perturbations). The
consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious adverse effect on public
confidence in the agency.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the operations in question
involve liaison with law enforcement or homeland security organizations, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure can imperil operations critical to the security of human life, critical
infrastructure protection, ore the protection of key national assets. For those operations, the



8
    Central fiscal operations focus on central Federal government functions rather than on central agency functions.




                                                           59
consequences to key financial infrastructure elements can be serious to severe. In such cases, the
associated confidentiality impact level will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact level recommended for
most central fiscal operations information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
include central fiscal operations information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central fiscal operations information is normally low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central fiscal operations
information. Central fiscal operations processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central fiscal operations information is low.
C.2.8.2 Legislative Functions Information Type

Legislative functions include the service support activities associated with costs of the
Legislative Branch other than the Tax Court, the Library of Congress, and the Government
Printing Office revolving fund. The recommended security categorization for the legislative
service support information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislative functions
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide service support activities associated
with costs of the Legislative Branch other than the Tax Court, the Library of Congress, and the
Government Printing Office revolving fund. The effects of loss of confidentiality of information
associated with legislative functions can be expected to have only a limited impact on Federal
government assets, operations, or personnel welfare.




                                                     60
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislative functions information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
Misunderstandings resulting from modified information that is actually exchanged can usually be
resolved and any resulting damage to the support function from modified information that is
exchanged would usually be limited.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
legislative service support information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
inter-agency relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency.
However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislative functions information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislative service support
information. Legislative functions processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislative functions information is low.
C.2.8.3 Executive Functions Information Type

Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended provisional security
categorization for the executive information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is associated with
executive functions. The effects of loss of confidentiality of policies and guidance during the
formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence
and/or impede the policy and guidance development process. Premature public release of
formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and review can result in




                                                     61
unnecessary damage to public confidence in the executive office. These consequences may
occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for executive functions information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain executive information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the government.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
executive information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the executive information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
executive functions information is low.
C.2.8.4 Central Property Management Information Type

Central Property Management involves most of the operations of the General Services
Administration. The following recommended provisional security categorization of central
property management information is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure
elements or key national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low9), (integrity, Low4), (availability, Low10)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central property
management information on the ability of the General Services Administration to acquire,
provide, and centrally administer offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets and
consumable supplies used by the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized


9
    Impact level is usually high where safety of major critical infrastructure components or key national assets is at
    stake.
10
   Impact level is usually moderate to high in emergency situations where time-critical processes affecting human
    safety or major assets are involved.




                                                           62
disclosure of most central property management information are likely to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or
legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and
operations. Also, information associated with acquisition, maintenance, administration, and
operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational
facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities to
facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In this case, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at least moderate.

Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of other Federal
government facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer
such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets,
or people. Examples of more potentially damaging information include architectural,
maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert pedestrian or
unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI
Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power
plants, etc.). In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be high.

[Some information is classified as national security and is outside the scope of this guideline.]
Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s central property management
information by GSA could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
the central property management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
tasked with acquiring and managing government facilities and supplies.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central property management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management
information usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the
immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information
will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of central
property management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.




                                                 63
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central property management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central property management
information. The functions supported by most central property management information are
tolerant of delays. Typically, the disruption of access to central property management
information will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions
and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management. In such cases, delays measured in hours can cost lives
and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with
unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management information needed to
respond to emergencies may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central property management information is low.
C.2.8.5 Central Personnel Management Information Type

Central Personnel Management involves most of the operating activities of the Office of
Personnel Management and related agencies. The recommended security categorization for the
central personnel management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central personnel
management information on the ability of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to build a
high quality and diverse Federal workforce, based on merit system principles. Central personnel
management information includes human resources management and consulting services,
education and leadership development services, and investigation services. The unauthorized
disclosure of most central personnel management information will have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Very sensitive information is
typically personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information
provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
information type.) Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact
level. Some information associated with investigative services may be particularly sensitive and
require a high confidentiality impact level.




                                                     64
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central personnel management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of central personnel
management information can conceivably disrupt central personnel management operations (e.g.,
(e.g., by modifying sensitive private personal information or compromising confidentiality
mechanisms).

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of central
personnel management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
public confidence in the government. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central personnel management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central personnel management
information. Central personnel management processes are generally tolerant of reasonable
delays. In most cases, disruption of access to central personnel management information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central personnel management information is low.
C.2.8.6 Taxation Management Information Type

Taxation Management includes activities associated with the implementation of the Internal
Revenue Code and the collection of taxes in the United States and abroad. The recommended
security categorization for the taxation management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of taxation management
information on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce the Internal Revenue
Code and to collect taxes in the United States and abroad. The IRS Guidebook for Information
Sensitivity Analysis provides guidelines for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO)
Information. Sensitive information is identified in the IRM as any information which if lost,
stolen, (accessed), or altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service



                                                     65
operations. The IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause
lawsuits against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the Service, and
public distrust of the Service’s ability to protect such information – all of which may result in an
increase in noncompliance with tax laws. It notes that unauthorized release of information such
as the name and address of an informant (in cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a
person’s life.11 Additionally, sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as
information that requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from
inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information. Sensitive information includes
information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the agency to accomplish
its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals that require protection under the
Privacy Act, and information not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. The IRS
OUO guideline notes that prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal
matters, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency rules
and regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security. Unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive or private IRS information can be expected to have a serious effect on
both the welfare of individuals and public confidence in the government.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where unauthorized
disclosure of taxation information can impede anti-terrorism or other homeland security
activities or endanger the lives of agents or informants, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for taxation management information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management information
may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which
the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently
or acted upon immediately. Also, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction
of taxation management information on overall agency mission functions is expected to be
limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There is a potential for tax code
enforcement, other law enforcement, or anti-terrorism actions being taken based on modified or
incomplete information. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management
information may result in distribution of false and misleading information. Such events can be
expected to adversely affect individuals, operations, and/or public confidence in the agency.
This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission capability. In extreme cases
(e.g., misidentification of an informant), the consequences can be life threatening. In such cases,
a high integrity impact may exist.

11
     Such information would have a high confidentiality default confidentiality impact rating.




                                                           66
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
taxation management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the taxation management information.
Taxation management processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to taxation management information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. However, even
temporary loss of availability of taxation management information is likely to have an adverse
effect on public confidence in the agency and on Federal government cash flow.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will result in only
limited consequences, repeated disruptions can have a serious adverse effect on public
confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission
capability. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate. Loss of availability of
significant amounts of taxation management information over long periods of time can do
serious harm to Federal government operations. The economic ramifications would potentially
be severe.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
taxation management information is low.
C.2.8.7 Central Records and Statistics Management Information Type

Central Records and Statistics Management involves the operations surrounding the management
of official documents, statistics, and records for the entire Federal Government. This information
type is intended to include information and information systems associated with the management
of records and statistics for the Federal government as a whole, such as the records management
performed by NARA or the statistics and data collection performed by the Bureau of the Census.
Note: Many agencies perform records and statistics management for a particular business
function and as such should be mapped to the service support, management, or mission area
associated with that business function. The central records and statistics management
information type is intended for functions performed on behalf of the entire Federal government.
The recommended security categorization for the central records and statistics management
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central records and
statistics management information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage official
documents, statistics, and records for the entire Federal Government. Unauthorized disclosure of




                                                     67
raw data and other source information for central records and statistics management operations is
likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the dissemination of
personal and government information. (The provisional impact levels for personnel information
are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, Representative Payee, and
Entitlement Event information types.)

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
centrally managed records can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central records and statistics management information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of central records and statistics
management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or
the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central records and statistics management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central records and statistics
management information. Central records and statistics management processes are generally
tolerant of reasonable delays. Generally, disruption of access to central records and statistics
management information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central records and statistics management information is low.
C.2.8.8 Income Information

Income information includes all the wages, self-employment earnings, savings data and other
financial resources information that is needed to help determine the amount of Retirement,
Survivor, or Disability benefits that individuals may be entitled to receive or not receive from the
Supplementary Security Income or RSDI Title II Programs. In most cases, the impact levels are
based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of income
information on the ability of the Federal government to identify citizen entitlements and




                                                68
obligations and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. The recommended security categorization for the income information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of income
information on the ability of the Federal government to identify citizen entitlements and
obligations and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other source information for benefits
determination and revenue collection operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and
other regulations applicable to the dissemination of personal and government information.
Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed income information can have a serious adverse
effect on agency missions. Very large aggregate tort awards can result from large-scale
disclosure of income information. Therefore, for agencies that manage large income information
involving records of the general public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be
expected to be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for income information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific purpose to which income information is put;
and not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In the case
of very large data bases containing income information relating to the general public, there is a
significant probability that erroneous actions will be taken affecting the benefits entitlements or
liabilities (e.g., tax liabilities) of large numbers of individuals. This can result in at least short-
term financial hardship for citizens. It can also be expected to result in very serious disruption of
the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for taking corrective actions.
In such cases, the integrity impact level would be at least moderate.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and
where the information affected is limited to employees, the consequences may justify only a low
provisional impact rating.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
income information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific purpose to which income information is
put; and not on the time required to re-establish access to the income information. Benefits
determination and liability calculation (e.g., taxation) processes are generally tolerant of




                                                    69
reasonable delays. In many cases, disruption of access to income information can be expected to
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing income information relating to the general public, there is a significant probability
that processing delays will affect the benefits entitlements or liabilities (e.g., tax liabilities) of
large numbers of individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer the delays
that can be expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for citizens and in serious
disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for backlog
processing. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least moderate. In the case
of permanent loss of records, the impact might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
income information is moderate.
C.2.8.9 Personal Identity and Authentication Information

Personal identity and authentication information includes that information necessary to ensure
that all persons who are potentially entitled to receive any federal benefit are enumerated and
identified so that Federal agencies can have reasonable assurance that they are paying or
communicating with the right individuals. This information include individual citizen’s Social
Security Numbers, names, dates of birth, places of birth, parents’ names, etc.12 The
recommended security categorization for the personal identity and authentication information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of personal
identity and authentication information on the ability of Federal agencies to determine that
communications with and payments to individuals are being made with or to the correct
individuals - and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other source information for identity
authentication operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations
applicable to the dissemination of personal and government information. There are many cases
in which unauthorized disclosure of personal identity and authentication information will have
only a limited adverse effect on government operations, assets, or individuals. However, the
potential for use of such information by criminals to perpetrate identity theft and related fraud
can do serious harm to individuals. Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed personal
identity and authentication information, such as passport and visa control databases can have a
serious adverse effect on agency missions.
12
  Persons conducting sensitive or payment related business with the government must identify themselves to the
level prescribed by appropriate governing directives using such data.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Very large aggregate tort awards can
result from large-scale disclosure of personal identity and authentication information. For
agencies that manage large income information involving records of the general public, the
provisional confidentiality impact level can be expected to be at least moderate. Where personal
identity and authentication information is used in controlling access to facilities (e.g., Federal
facilities, critical infrastructure facilities, key national assets) or for border control purposes, the
consequences of unauthorized disclosure that permits credentials forgery can justify a high
impact assignment.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific purpose to which personal identity and
authentication information is put; and not on the time required to detect the modification or
destruction of information. In the case of very large databases containing personal identity and
authentication information relating to the general public, there is a significant probability that
erroneous actions will be taken affecting benefits entitlements of or access to facilities by large
numbers of individuals. In the case of benefits, this can result in at least short-term financial
hardship for citizens. It can also be expected to result in very serious disruption of the agency
operations due to large time and resource requirements for taking corrective actions.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and
where the information affected is limited to employees, there will still be an impact, but the
consequences may justify only a low provisional impact rating. Where a data modification
permits access to facilities (or ingress into the United States) by individuals to whom access
should be prohibited, the integrity impact could be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific purpose to which personal identity and
authentication information is put; and not on the time required to re-establish access to the
personal identity and authentication information. Benefits determination processes are generally
tolerant of reasonable delays. In many cases, disruption of access to personal identity and
authentication information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing personal identity and authentication information relating to the general public, there is
a significant probability that processing delays will affect the benefits entitlements of or access to




                                                  71
facilities by large numbers of individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer
the delays that can be expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for citizens and in
serious disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for
backlog processing. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least moderate. In
the case of permanent loss of records or access to facilities by emergency personnel, the impact
might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
personal identity and authentication information is moderate.
C.2.8.10 Entitlement Event Information

Entitlement event information includes information about events such as death and date of
occurrence, date of a disabling event and the relating data that can reasonably prove the severity
of such disability, proof of age for retirement benefits, birth and relationship of spouse and/or
children who may be entitled to benefits only as auxiliaries of the primary beneficiary, and other
related information needed to process a claim for benefits. This also includes means-related
information required to administer all the means related benefits associated with the Title XVI
(Supplementary Security Income Program) and the new drug provisions of the recently revised
Medicare Program. The recommended security categorization for the entitlement event
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of entitlement
event information on the ability of the Federal government to establish qualifications of
individuals to receive government benefits - and to protect individuals and the Federal
government against fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other source information for
entitlement operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations
applicable to the dissemination of personal information.

Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed entitlement event information can have a serious
adverse effect on agency missions. Significant hardships for individuals and very large
aggregate tort awards against the government can result from large-scale disclosure of some
entitlement event information. Therefore for agencies that manage large income information
involving records of the general public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be
expected to be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for entitlement event information is moderate.




                                                    72
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific use of the entitlement event information and
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In the case of
very large databases containing entitlement event information relating to the general public, there
is a significant probability that erroneous actions will be taken affecting the benefits entitlements
of large numbers of individuals. This can result in at least short-term financial hardship for
citizens. It can also be expected to result in serious disruption of the agency operations due to
the time and resource requirements for taking corrective actions. In such cases, the integrity
impact level would be at least moderate.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and
where the information affected is limited to employees, the consequences may justify only a low
provisional impact rating.
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
entitlement event information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific use of the entitlement event information and
not on the time required to re-establish access to the income information. Benefits determination
processes are generally tolerant of reasonable delays. In many cases, disruption of access to
entitlement event information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing entitlement event information relating to the general public, there is a significant
probability that processing delays will affect the benefits entitlements of large numbers of
individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer the delays that can be
expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for citizens. It can also result in very
serious disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for
backlog processing. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least moderate. In
the case of permanent loss of records, the impact might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
income information is moderate.
C.2.8.11 Representative Payee Information

Representative payee information includes the information required to determine the need for
representative payees and the data that is gathered to make the determination of who should
serve as the representative payee for all beneficiaries of federal benefits who are unable to
manage their own funds. This also includes accountability information required to provide
reasonable assurance that the funds are being used appropriately for the well being of entitled
individuals. The recommended security categorization for the representative payee information
type is as follows:



                                                  73
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of
representative payee information on the ability of the Federal government to determine that
entitlement funds are being used appropriately for the well being of entitled individuals - and to
protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against fraud.
Unauthorized disclosure of data for representative payee operations is likely to violate the
Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the dissemination of personal
information.

Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed representative payee information can have a
serious adverse effect on agency missions and on large numbers of individuals. Great hardship
for individuals and very large aggregate tort awards against the government can result from
large-scale disclosure of representative payee information. Therefore, in the case of large
representative payee information databases, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be
expected to be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for representative payee information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific use of the payee information and not on the
time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In the case of very large
databases containing representative payee information relating to the general public, there is a
significant probability that erroneous actions will be taken affecting the benefits payments to
large numbers of individuals. This can result in at least short-term financial hardship for our
most vulnerable citizens. Loss of integrity can result in serious disruption of the agency
operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level would be at least moderate.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of fraudulent diversion of
payments intended for particularly dependent individuals, there can be life-threatening
consequences. In such cases, a high integrity impact rating may be justified.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
representative payee information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific use of the representative payee information
and not on the time required to re-establish access to the representative payee information.
Benefits payment processes are not necessarily tolerant of delays. In many cases, disruption of
access to representative payee information can be expected to have a very serious adverse effect
on individuals.




                                                    74
Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
containing representative payee information relating to the general public, there is a significant
probability that processing delays will affect the benefits payments to large numbers of
individuals. The larger the number of records affected, the longer the delays that can be
expected to result. This can result in financial hardship for some individuals and in serious
disruption of agency operations. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least
moderate. In the case of permanent loss of records, the impact might even be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
representative payee information is moderate.

C.3 Rationale and Factors for Government Resource Management
   Information
Resource management functions are the back office support activities that enable the government
to operate effectively. Security objectives and impacts for resource management functions are
determined by the direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported. It is
likely that all Federal government information systems store, process, and operate under the
control of IT infrastructure maintenance information (e.g., password files and file and network
access settings). A basic set of security controls will apply to this information and processes to
combat potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.

C.3.1 Administrative Management

Administrative Management involves the day-to-day management and maintenance of the
internal infrastructure. Administrative information is usually routine and is relatively low
impact. However, some administrative management information is either very sensitive (e.g.,
logistics management for nuclear or other hazardous materials, security management
information, and security clearance management information) or critical (e.g., inventory control
and logistics management information needed to support time-critical operations). National
security information is outside the scope of this guideline. [See Appendix A, Glossary of Terms,
for a definition of national security information/systems.] Routine administrative management
information systems that do not process classified information are not usually designated
national security systems, even if they are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or
                       13
intelligence missions.

C.3.1.1 Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment Management Information Type

Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment management involves the maintenance, administration, and
operation of offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets considered as
possessions of the Federal government. Impacts to some information and information systems
associated with facilities, fleet, and equipment management may affect the security of some key
national assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities). The following



                                                  75
recommended provisional categorization of the facilities, fleet, and equipment management
information type is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or key
national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low13), (integrity, Low14), (availability, Low14)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information on the ability of responsible agencies to maintain,
administer, and operate offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets of the
Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with
maintenance, administration, and operation of many Federal government office buildings,
transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain
access to Federal facilities in order to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal
enterprise (e.g., extract inmates from Federal detention facilities). In this case, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at least moderate.

Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of other Federal
government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material
use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations
intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of this
information include information that reveals specific measures respecting limiting access to and
operation of government aircraft, maintenance and administrative information that might permit
either covert pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g.,
Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian
Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.), and schedules/itineraries of government
surface transportation fleets (e.g., for transport of executive personnel or hazardous materials).
In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to be high.

[Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified as
national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as
Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security
information, but must have a high confidentiality impact level.]



13
   Impact level is usually high where safety of major critical infrastructure components or key national assets is at
   stake.
14
   Impact level is usually moderate to high in emergency situations where time-critical processes affecting human
   safety or major assets are involved.




                                                          76
Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-
jurisdictional coordination within the facilities, fleet, and equipment management infrastructure
and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with facilities, fleet, and/or equipment
management.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or
the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such cases, the integrity
impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information can be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information. Functions supported by most facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information is tolerant of delays. Typically, disruption of access to facilities, fleet,
and equipment management information has a limited adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such cases, delays
measured in seconds can cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability
impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.




                                                77
C.3.1.2 Help Desk Services Information Type

Help Desk Services involves the management of a service center to respond to government
employees' technical and administrative questions. Subject to exception conditions described
below, the recommended provisional security categorization for the help desk service
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of help desk service
information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage of service center responses to
government employees' technical and administrative questions. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most help desk service information are likely to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with service
center responses can provide useful information to adversaries seeking to penetrate Federal
systems. If the contents or functions of a system have sufficient sensitivity and/or criticality, a
moderate or high impact level may be considered for help desk information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for help desk service information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of help desk service information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be time-
critical or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In relatively few cases would the
consequences of unauthorized modification of help desk information that is acted upon
immediately result in more than limited damage to agency operations or assets. Exceptions may
include bogus information regarding operation of communications processors, data base systems,
or other systems necessary to emergency response aspects of disaster management, criminal
apprehension, air traffic control or other time-critical missions. In such cases, a moderate or
high integrity impact level might be considered for unauthorized modification or destruction of
help desk service information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for help
desk service information is low.




                                                     78
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to help desk service information.
Typically, disruption of access to help desk service information will have a limited adverse effect
on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response components of disaster management or other time-critical functions (e.g., some systems
that support air traffic control functions). Consequently, the availability impact level associated
with unauthorized modification or destruction of help desk service information needed to
respond to emergencies can be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
help desk service information is low.
C.3.1.3 Security Management Information Type

Security Management involves the physical protection of an organization’s personnel, assets, and
facilities. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with security
management may affect the security of some critical infrastructure elements and key national
assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities). Impact levels
associated with security information directly relate to the potential threat to human life
associated with the asset(s) being protected (e.g., consequences to the public of terrorist access to
dams or nuclear power plants). The following recommended categorization of the facilities, fleet,
and equipment management information type is subject to change where critical infrastructure
elements or key national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security management
information on the ability of responsible organizations to physically protect their personnel,
assets, and facilities. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most security management
information depend on the likelihood that the information might jeopardize the physical security
of an organization’s assets and the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected.

Information associated with the physical security of many Federal government office buildings,
transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain
access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate a major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from
Federal detention facilities, theft of commodities market projections, access to information
associated with a felony criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing
facilities and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated with major
procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties, access to currency



                                                     79
printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or bullion storage facilities). In such
cases, unauthorized disclosure if information can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s security
management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-
jurisdictional coordination within the security management infrastructure and the general
effectiveness of organizations tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The
consequences of physical protection failures at most Federal facilities are more likely to result in
serious15 adverse effects.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with security
management at other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational
facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such
facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or
people. Examples of more potentially damaging information includes information that reveals
specific measures for protecting government aircraft, information that might permit access that
creates an opportunity to bomb a government building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI
Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power
plants, etc.), and leadership protection details that could result in assassination opportunities. In
these cases, the confidentiality impact must be high.

Unauthorized disclosure of security management information that can be reasonably expected to
pose a serious threat to human life (including those of security guards) must also be assigned a
high confidentiality impact. [Security management information associated with some Federal
government assets is classified. The classified information is national security related and is
outside the scope of this guideline.] Other security management information, such as that
affecting Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” or Internal Revenue Service
“Limited For Official Use Only” information is not national security information, but must be
treated as having high confidentiality impact.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact level recommended for
most security management information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of security management information
may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which
the information is used. In cases of intrusion indications, security management information can
be time-critical.



15
     A loss of confidentiality that causes a significant degradation in mission capability, places the agency at a
     significant disadvantage, or results in major damage to assets, requiring extensive corrective actions or repairs.




                                                             80
The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical security
management information can reasonably be expected to result in physical security
vulnerabilities. The range of potential consequences is covered above in Confidentiality.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most security management information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the security management information.
Functions supported by most security management information are tolerant of delays. Typically,
disruption of access to security management information will have a limited adverse effect on
agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include alarm and alert
communications and interconnections for security management systems and automated control
systems that support security management processes (e.g., door and gate operations in buildings
to which access is limited such as detention facilities and many Federal office buildings For
these exceptions, the data is time-critical. The availability impact level associated with
unauthorized modification or destruction of such alarm, alert, and automated process security
management information may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
security management information is low.
C.3.1.4 Travel Information Type

Travel involves the activities associated with planning, preparing, and monitoring of business
related travel for an organization’s employees. The following security categorization is
recommended for the travel information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of travel information on
the abilities of responsible agencies to plan, prepare, and monitor business related travel for the
organization’s employees. Generally, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the
majority of travel information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of employee
identification information coupled with credit information (e.g., name, social security number,
credit card number) can result in moderate to serious consequences for individuals and local




                                                     81
organizations. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type.

Unauthorized disclosure of information concerning carrier/provider contract negotiations can
have significant financial or legal consequences and put an agency at a serious disadvantage.
Also, severe consequences may result from unauthorized disclosure of information regarding
leadership travel plans that might jeopardize personnel security or the confidentiality of sensitive
operations plans. In the most sensitive cases, the confidentiality impact level may be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for travel information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of travel information partially depends
on the urgency with which the information is normally needed and the consequences of aborted
or modified travel.

In the case of travel planning information, the effects of such modifications are generally limited
with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets. There may be scenarios in which integrity
compromise of travel information may expose Federal leadership to harm or endanger a sensitive
or critical operation. However, most such scenarios are dealt with in the context of impacts to
mission operations information (Appendix D).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
travel information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the travel information. The nature of
travel processes is usually tolerant of reasonable delays, at least on the agency mission scale.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
travel information is low.
C.3.1.5 Workplace Policy Development and Management Information Type (Intra-Agency
       Only)

Workplace policy development and management includes all activities required to develop and
disseminate workplace policies such as dress codes, time reporting requirements, telecommuting,
etc. The following security categorization is recommended for the workplace policy development
and management information type:




                                                 82
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of workplace policy
development and management information on the abilities of responsible agencies to develop
and disseminate workplace policies such as dress codes, time reporting requirements, and
telecommuting. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of workplace
policy development and management information will result in a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for workplace policy development and management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of workplace policy development
and management information depends primarily on the criticality of the information with respect
to agency mission capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Typically,
the effects of modification or deletion of this information are generally limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
workplace policy development and management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the workplace policy development and
management information. Generally, workplace policy development and management processes
are tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
workplace policy development and management information is low.

C.3.2 Financial Management

Financial management involves the aggregate set of accounting practices and procedures that
allow for the accurate and effective handling of all government revenues, funding, and
expenditures. Confidentiality impacts associated with financial management information are
generally associated with the sensitivity of the existence of specific projects, programs,
and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized disclosure of information. For
integrity, temporary successful frauds can affect agency image, and corrective actions are
often disruptive to agency operations. Permanent loss/unavailability of financial
management information can cripple agency operations.




                                                     83
C.3.2.1 Assets and Liability Management Information Type

Assets and Liability Management provide accounting support for the management of assets and
liabilities of the Federal government. Assets and liability management activities measure the
total cost and revenue of Federal programs, and their various elements, activities and outputs.
Assets and liability management is essential for providing accurate program measurement
information, performance measures, and financial statements with verifiable reporting of the cost
of activities. The recommended security categorization for the assets and liability management
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of assets and liability
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide accounting support for
the management of assets and liabilities of the Federal government. Generally, the unauthorized
disclosure of assets and liability management information will have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
asset and liability management information for programs that process high-impact information
can assist some criminals to evade enforcement activities. Examples range from tax evasion
resulting from unauthorized disclosure of information regarding audit budgets to unauthorized
disclosure of budget details for specific border control, antiterrorism, or witness protection
expenditures. Where actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of assets and liability
management details pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets, the confidentiality
impact is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The recommended provisional confidentiality impact
level for assets and liability management information is low.
Integrity
The accuracy of assets and liability management information is essential to providing accurate
program measurement information, performance measures, and financial statements with
verifiable reporting of the cost of activities. The integrity impact level is based on the specific
mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification
or destruction of information. Also, the consequences of unauthorized modification or
destruction of assets and liability management information may depend on the urgency with
which the information is needed. Assets and liability management activities are not generally
time-critical and a compromise would have only limited adverse effects on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.




                                                     84
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If reports based on modified or incomplete
information are circulated, the adverse effect on mission functions and public confidence in the
agency can be serious. In such cases, the integrity impact would be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
assets and liability management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the assets and liability management
information. Assets and liability management processes are generally tolerant of delay.
Typically, disruption of access to assets and liability management information can be expected to
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
assets and liability management information is low.
C.3.2.2 Reporting and Information Information Type

Reporting and Information includes providing financial information, reporting and analysis of
financial transactions. Financial reporting includes the activities necessary to support:
management’s fiduciary role; budget formulation and execution functions; fiscal management of
program delivery and program decision making; and internal and external reporting
requirements. The recommended security categorization for the “financial reporting and
information” information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting
information on an agency’s ability to provide financial information and reporting and analysis of
financial transactions. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting information
will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of financial
reporting information for programs that process high-impact information can give adversaries
damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In relatively rare cases,
actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting details pose a threat to
human life or a loss of major assets, so the confidentiality impact is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for reporting and information is low.




                                                     85
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Financial
reporting activities are not generally time-critical. Many integrity compromises would result in
limited adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

If planning documents, proposals, or reports based on modified or incomplete information are
circulated; the adverse effect on mission functions or public confidence in the agency can be
serious. In most cases, serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals can be expected. The extensive audit and investigative actions that often follow
discovery of an agency’s use of falsified financial reports or omission of financial reporting data
can place the agency at a significant disadvantage.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
reporting and information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the assets and liability management
information. Financial reporting processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption
of access to financial reporting information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact recommended for
reporting and information is low.
C.3.2.3 Budget and Finance Information Type

Budget and Finance includes the management of the Federal budget process including the
development of plans and programs, budgets, and performance outputs and outcomes as well as
financing Federal programs and operations through appropriation and apportionment of direct
and reimbursable spending authority, fund transfers, investments and other financing
mechanisms. Budget and financial management includes the establishment of a system for
ensuring an organization does not obligate or disburse funds in excess of those appropriated or
authorized. The recommended security categorization for the budget and finance information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of budget and finance
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop plans and programs, budgets, and
performance outputs and outcomes; and to finance Federal programs and operations through




                                                     86
appropriation and apportionment of direct and reimbursable spending authority, fund transfers,
investments and other financing mechanisms.

In general, unauthorized disclosure of budget and finance information, particularly of budget
allocations for specific programs or program elements, can be seriously detrimental to
government interests in procurement processes. In many instances, such unauthorized disclosure
is prohibited by executive order or by law (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulations). Premature
release of draft budget and finance information can yield advantages to competing interests and
seriously endanger agency operations – or even agency mission.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of budget
and finance information for programs that process classified or high-impact information can give
adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. (Classified
programs and systems are outside the scope of this guideline.) In rare cases, actions taken based
on unauthorized disclosure of funds management details can pose a threat to human life or a loss
of major assets, so the confidentiality impact would be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: While, in many cases, unauthorized disclosure of
funds management information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
assets, or individuals, the potential for serious harm is such that the provisional confidentiality
impact level recommended for budget and finance information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Budget and
finance activities are not generally time-critical. An accumulation of small changes to data or
deletion of small entries can result in budget shortfalls or cases of excessive obligations or
disbursements.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: In most cases, the adverse effects of consequent negative
publicity on mission functions, image or public confidence in the agency can be serious.
Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level recommended for budget and finance
information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the budget and finance information.
Budget and finance processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to
budget and finance information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
budget and finance information is low.

C.3.2.4 Accounting Information Type

Accounting entails accounting for assets, liabilities, fund balances, revenues and expenses
associated with the maintenance of Federal funds and expenditure of Federal appropriations
(Salaries and Expenses, Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, Working Capital, Trust
Funds, etc.), in accordance with applicable Federal standards (FASAB, Treasury, OMB, GAO,
etc.). The recommended security categorization for the accounting information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of accounting
information on the abilities of government agencies to maintain Federal funds and expenditure of
Federal appropriations in accordance with applicable Federal standards. Unauthorized disclosure
of accounting information for programs that process classified or high-impact information can
give adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of accounting information will have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. (Classified programs and systems are outside
the scope of this guideline.)

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In relatively rare cases, actions taken
based on unauthorized disclosure of accounting details can pose a threat to human life or a loss
of major assets, so the confidentiality impact would be high.

In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of accounting information can violate proprietary
information or other non-disclosure agreements. In such cases, the government may suffer not
only a loss of public confidence, but may become vulnerable to legal actions. Where sensitive or
proprietary information is involved, the impact of unauthorized disclosure is likely to be
moderate. Where the accounting information is involved in an audit associated with suspected
fraud or other criminal activities, the investigation may be imperiled. Here too, the impact of
unauthorized disclosure is likely to be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for accounting information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Accounting
activities are not generally time-critical. An accumulation of small changes to data or deletion of
small entries can result in cost overruns and other cases of excessive obligations or
disbursements. In most cases, the adverse effects of consequent negative publicity and
institution of corrective action programs on mission functions and public confidence in the
agency can be serious.



                                                     88
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, undetected integrity
compromises can be extremely expensive to the government and its employees in terms of both
monetary losses and loss of reputation.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
accounting information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the accounting information.
Accounting processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to
accounting information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
accounting information is low.
C.3.2.5 Payments Information Type

Payments include disbursements of Federal funds, via a variety of mechanisms, to Federal and
private individuals, Federal agencies, state, local and international Governments, and the private
sector, to effect payment for goods and services, or distribute entitlements, benefits, grants,
subsidies, loans, or claims. Payment management provides appropriate control over all
payments made by or on behalf of an organization, including but not limited to payments made
to: vendors in accordance with contracts, purchase orders and other obligating documents; state
governments under a variety of programs; employees for salaries and expense reimbursements;
other Federal agencies for reimbursable work performed; individual citizens receiving Federal
benefits; and recipients of Federal loans. The recommended security categorization for the
payments information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of payments information
on the ability of responsible agencies to provide appropriate control over all payments made by
or on behalf of an organization. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of payments information
will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Payment information typically
includes information needed for electronic payments such as bank account numbers.
Unauthorized access to this type of information could result in significant financial loss for both
the Federal government and its payees. Where payment activities are part of an agency’s service
delivery mission (e.g., payment of benefits), Privacy Act information and other information




                                                     89
subject to statutory or regulatory dissemination controls must appear in the payment vehicles
(e.g., name and social security number on check records). (The provisional impact levels for
personnel information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income,
Representative Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such cases, the
confidentiality impact level can be at least moderate. (See C.2.8.8.)

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for payments information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Payments
activities are not generally time-critical. An accumulation of small changes to data or deletion of
small entries can result in cost overruns and other cases of excessive disbursements. In most
cases, the adverse effects of consequent negative publicity and institution of corrective action
programs on mission functions or public confidence in the agency can be serious.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where payment activities are part of an
agency’s service delivery mission (e.g., payment of benefits), the consequences of integrity
compromises that result in failure of payments to go to the appropriate entity can range from
minor to life-threatening. In such cases, the availability impact level can be high. (See C.2.8.11.)

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: For most Federal government payment systems, the
provisional integrity impact level recommended for payments information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the payments information. Payment
processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to payments information
can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where payment activities are part of an
agency’s service delivery mission (e.g., payment of benefits), the consequences of loss of
information availability that result in failure of payments to go to the appropriate entity can range
from minor to life-threatening. In such cases, the availability impact level can be moderate or
high. (See C.2.8.11.)

Recommended Availability Impact Level: For most Federal government payment systems, the
provisional availability impact level recommended for payments information is low.
C.3.2.6 Collections and Receivables Information Type

Collections and Receivables include deposits, fund transfers, and receipts for sales or service.



                                                 90
Receivable management supports activities associated with recognizing and recording debts due
to the Government, performing follow-up actions to collect on these debts, and recording cash
receipts. The recommended security categorization for the collections and receivables
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of collections and
receivables information on the ability of responsible agencies to recognize and record debts due

C.3.3 Human Resources

Human resources activities involve all activities associated with the recruitment and
management of personnel.




                                                     91
C.3.3.1 Benefits Management Information Type

Benefits management involves the administration of entitled benefits for federal personnel such
as retirement, medical, disability, and insurance. The following security categorization is
recommended for the benefits management information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of benefits management
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to administer entitled benefits for federal
personnel such as retirement, medical, disability, and insurance. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of the majority of benefits management information will result in a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or information that is proprietary to a
corporation or other organization. In such cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
benefits management information could be serious (particularly in cases of exposure of large
data bases that might reveal private medical information or facilitate identity theft or other
financial fraud). (The provisional impact levels for personnel information are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such
cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for benefits management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of benefits management information
depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission capability,
protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. In general, the effects of modifications or
deletion of this information are generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or
assets.

C.3.3.5 Security Clearance Management Information Type

Security clearance management refers to the processes associated with ensuring employees,
contractors, and others have been approved to enter Federal buildings, utilize Federal services,
and access sensitive information. This includes eligibility determination, badge issuance,
clearance tracking, and security verification services. Impacts to some information and
information systems associated with security clearance management may affect the security of
critical infrastructures and key national assets. Also, although much information associated with
security clearance management is national security related (outside the scope of this guideline);
security clearance management, as used in this guideline, is not restricted to national security
applications. The following security categorization is recommended for the security clearance
management information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security clearance
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to manage access eligibility determination,
badge issuance, clearance tracking, and security verification services for Federal information and
facilities. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of security clearance
management information can facilitate attempts by terrorists, other criminals, and other
unauthorized individuals to enter Federal buildings, utilize Federal services, and access sensitive
information. The consequences can range from limited loss of public confidence in an agency to
serious or catastrophic adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where terrorist acts are enabled, the
confidentiality impact must be high. In cases of critical infrastructure facilities, key national
assets, law enforcement facilities, and homeland security facilities, the confidentiality impact
must be high.

Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of staff recruitment and employment
information depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission
capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Although there can be serious
short-term effects for individuals, the effects of modifications or deletion of this information are
generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
staff recruitment and employment information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the staff recruitment and employment
information. The nature of staff recruitment and employment processes is tolerant of reasonable
delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
staff recruitment and employment information is low.

C.3.4 Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management involves the purchasing, tracking, and overall management of
goods and services.
C.3.4.1 Goods Acquisition Information Type

Goods acquisition involves the procurement of physical goods, products, and capital assets to be
used by the Federal government. The recommended security categorization for the goods
acquisition information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     99
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of goods acquisition
information on the ability of agencies to procure physical goods, products, and capital assets to
be used by the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most goods
acquisition information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal
proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations.
Also, information associated with acquisition of many Federal government facilities can be
useful to criminals seeking to gain access to those facilities. In these cases, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would range from moderate to high. Also,
unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s goods acquisition information by another agency could
result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the goods acquisition
infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with acquisition of
government facilities and supplies. Additionally, some procurement information associated with
proposals is proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated
with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing
information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences
for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some procurement
information is classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside
the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for goods acquisition information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of goods acquisition information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external publication of goods acquisition information (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect public confidence in the agency. However, damage to the
mission would usually be limited. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
relating to procurement actions (particularly proposal information) can result in serious
disruption of procurement processes that can be important or even critical to agency operations.
In such cases, the integrity impact level can be moderate or even high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
modification or destruction of most goods acquisition information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the goods acquisition information.
Functions and processes supported by most goods acquisition information are tolerant of
delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. Typically,
disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including
mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
procurements necessary to support response aspects of disaster management. In such cases,
delays may cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact
level associated with disruption of access to goods acquisition information needed to respond
to emergencies may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
goods acquisition information is low.
C.3.4.2 Inventory Control Information Type

Inventory control refers to the tracking of information related to procured assets and resources
with regards to quantity, quality, and location. The recommended security categorization for the
inventory control information type is as follows:

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of inventory control
information on the ability of agencies to track information related to procured assets and
resources with regards to quantity, quality, and location. The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of most inventory control information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with inventories of hazardous materials (e.g., radioactive materials,
toxins, bio-hazardous items, explosives) can facilitate terrorist or other criminal activities that
may result in serious effects on Federal government assets and operations and on the general
public. In general, inventory control information can be of material use to criminals seeking to
perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In these cases too, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact of these types of criminal exploitation of
unauthorized disclosure of inventory control information would range from moderate to high.




                                                     101
Also, unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s inventory control information by another agency
could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the inventory control
infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with the distribution and
accounting of government facilities and supplies. Some inventory control information is
classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this
guideline.

not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of inventory control information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed
urgently or acted upon immediately.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
inventory control information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
inventory control information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to inventory control information.

disruption of access to inventory control information will have a limited adverse effect on
agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
requirements to access and distribute materials necessary for disaster management. In such
cases, delays may cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the impact level for
inventory control information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
inventory control information is low.

information on the ability of agencies to plan and track the availability and location of personnel
and their resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most logistics management
information are likely to have only limited adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of logistics
information associated with homeland security, law enforcement and some transportation
activities (e.g., air transport) can facilitate terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in
serious on Federal government assets and operations and on the general public. Logistics
management information associated with a broad range of mission areas can be of material use to
criminals seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or other criminal enterprises. Also, this information
is a key intelligence target for those seeking information on defense or law enforcement
capabilities, dispositions and intent. In all these cases, the unauthorized disclosure of logistics
management information may result in serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency
assets, and individuals. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level for these types of criminal
exploitation of unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information will range from
moderate to high. Some logistics management information is classified (e.g., some military
logistics information). The classified information is national security related and is outside the
scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most logistics management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of logistics management information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used. In most cases, the information will not be needed urgently or

C.3.5 Information and Technology Management

IT management involves the coordination of IT resources and systems required to support or
enable a citizen service. Impacts to information associated with the operation of IT systems
generally need to be considered even when all mission-related information processed by the
system is intended to be available to the general public. The relevant issues may be different
for integrity and availability than for confidentiality. Information that has been made public,
by definition, requires no confidentiality protection. In contrast, integrity and availability
protection cannot be maintained for copies of information that have been distributed to the
public. Integrity and availability assurance can only be maintained by maintaining copies of
information in organization-controlled information systems.
C.3.5.1 System Development Information Type

System Development supports all activities associated with the in-house design and development
of software applications. The recommended security categorization for the system development
information type is as follows:

information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of system maintenance
information on the ability of responsible agencies to maintain in-house designed software
applications. In most cases, system maintenance information is not particularly sensitive and is
distributed to the users. In general, disclosure of system maintenance information is likely to
result in only limited adverse effects on the confidentiality of system information and processes.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional impact level recommended for system
maintenance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of system maintenance information




                                                    108
can be particularly serious because specific modifications to system changes can be difficult to
identify.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of undetected or
unauthorized modification or destruction of system maintenance information may depend on the
maximum aggregate sensitivity and criticality of the information and processes associated with
the system. The Recommended Integrity Impact Level can range from low to high to national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
system maintenance information is moderate.

The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to maintenance information.
Functions and processes supported by most maintenance information are not time-critical.
That is, temporary disruption of access to maintenance information will usually have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public
confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
system maintenance information is low.
C.3.5.4 IT Infrastructure Maintenance Information Type

IT infrastructure maintenance involves the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of
an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications
software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). IT infrastructure maintenance also
includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement information. This
information includes password files, network access rules and implementing files and/or switch
setting, hardware and software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access
to the information system’s data, programs, and/or processes. The impact levels associated with
IT infrastructure maintenance information are primarily a function of the information processed
in and through that infrastructure.

The IT Maintenance Information type represents a complex set of data elements that are used to
secure the design, implementation, and maintenance of systems and networks. The security of
each of these data elements is dependent on the security of the other data elements. Security
compromise of one data element type will propagate to others.

The recommended security categorization for the IT infrastructure maintenance information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, System High), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                    109
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT infrastructure
maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan, design, implement, and
maintain an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems,
applications software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). [See also Appendixes C.3.5.5,
IT Security Information and C.3.5.7, Information Management Information.] IT infrastructure
maintenance also includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement
information. Unauthorized disclosure of some IT infrastructure maintenance information can
lead to confidentiality compromise of information processed by the system (e.g., password files,
file access tables, cryptographic keying information, network access rules, and hardware and
software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the information
system’s data, programs, and/or processes). As a result, the confidentiality impact associated
with this information is that of the highest impact information processed by the system. Also, a
higher confidentiality impact may be associated with information in aggregate than is associated
with any single element of information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Particularly in the case of passwords and
cryptographic keys, the provisional impact level recommended for IT infrastructure maintenance
information depends on the sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes. As a
result the recommended provisional impact level is “system high.”
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of IT infrastructure maintenance
information usually depends on the urgency with which the data processed in the IT
infrastructure is needed or the time-critical nature of the data. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. In most cases, the consequences
of unauthorized modification of IT infrastructure maintenance information will result in limited
damage to agency operations or assets.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions may include incorrect
information used for emergency response aspects of disaster management, criminal
apprehension, air traffic control or other time-critical missions. In such cases, a moderate or
high integrity impact level might be considered.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for IT
infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT infrastructure maintenance
information. Functions and processes supported by most IT infrastructure maintenance




                                                  110
information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect
on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency),
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or other high load and time critical functions (e.g.,
some systems that support air traffic control functions). The effects of disruption of access to
IT infrastructure maintenance information or information systems may be to deny mission-
critical IT resources to all affected organizations. The availability impact level associated
with denial-of-service to IT infrastructure maintenance information needed to respond to
emergencies or critical to public safety can be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
IT infrastructure maintenance information is low.
C.3.5.5 IT Security Information Type

IT Security involves all functions pertaining to the securing of Federal data and systems through
the creation and definition of security policies, procedures and controls covering such services as
identification, authentication, and non-repudiation. The recommended security categorization
for the IT security information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT security
information on the ability of responsible agencies to secure Federal data and systems through the
creation and definition of security policies, procedures and controls covering such services as
identification, authentication, and non-repudiation. In most cases, the security policy,
procedures, and available controls are not particularly sensitive. Typically, the security
information is used in initializing and implementing the controls (e.g., passwords, cryptographic
keys) that need to be protected. In general, disclosure of the security policies, procedures, and
controls will result in only limited adverse effects on the confidentiality system information and
processes.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The recommended provisional confidentiality impact
level recommended for IT security information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for IT
security information is moderate.

Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT security information. Temporary
disruption of access to IT security information can usually be expected to have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in
the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
IT security information is low.
C.3.5.6 Record Retention Information Type

Records Retention involves the operations surrounding the management of the official
documents and records for an agency. Subject to exception conditions described below, the
recommended security categorization for the record retention information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of record retention
information on the ability of responsible organizations to store, track, account for, maintain,
retrieve, and disseminate official documents and records. When the data being retained belongs
to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned
the data and system is at least that of the highest impact information type collected. Typically,
the unauthorized disclosure of most business management information retained will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. National security information
and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will most commonly be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or
information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. The Privacy Act
Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. Such information will often be assigned a moderate
confidentiality impact level. Where any of the information to be collected can reasonably be
expected to have a high confidentiality impact level, then the record retention system must be
assigned a high confidentiality impact level. In some cases, the impact assessment should
consider that the aggregate of information retained might have a higher confidentiality impact
than any individual information element.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for record retention information is low.




                                                     112
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where integrity compromise adversely
affects the ability of an organization to access its records or results in erroneous back-up
information or archives, the impact on agency operations can be serious. In such cases, the
integrity impact level would be moderate. In the case of large-scale archives or archives
involving key national assets (e.g., national archives), the integrity impact can be particularly
severe and the impact level would be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
record retention information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to record retention information.
Functions and processes supported by most record retention information are not time-critical.
Record retention processes are generally tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to record retention information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Not many business management systems perform functions for which temporary loss of
availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a
significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
record retention information is low.
C.3.5.7 Information Management Information Type

Information Management involves the coordination of information collection, storage, and
dissemination, and destruction as well as managing the policies, guidelines, and standards
regarding information management. Subject to exception conditions described below, the
recommended security categorization for the information management information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, System High16), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality



16
     Confidentiality impact for access control information is that of the highest confidentiality, impact level assigned to
     any information that may be processed by the system.




                                                            113
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of information
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform the day-to-day
processes of information collection, storage, dissemination, and destruction and managing the
policies, guidelines, and standards regarding information management. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure depend largely on the content and use of the information being managed.
The unauthorized disclosure of information management information relevant to most
information managed by the government will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information collection and storage
involve the day-to-day processes of gathering and storing data from agency programs, partners,
and stakeholders. More sensitive information being managed is usually personal information
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other
organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be assigned
a moderate confidentiality impact level

Where any of the information to be managed can be expected to have a high confidentiality,
impact level, then the information management information must be assigned a high
confidentiality impact level. When the data being managed belongs to one of the information
types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned to the system is that of the
highest impact information type processed by the system. Depending on the agency and the
mission being supported, the sensitivity of the information can range from none (public
information) to high. (National security information and national security systems are outside
the scope of this guideline.)

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Particularly in the case of passwords and
cryptographic keys, the provisional impact level recommended for information management
information depends on the sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes. As a
result the recommended provisional impact level is “system high.”
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information management
information (e.g., configuration settings, passwords, authorization codes, cryptographic keying
material) can compromise the effectiveness of the system and impair agency operations. The
level of impact depends on the criticality of system functionality to the agency mission

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The loss of integrity for some information
management information (e.g., encryption keys) can be very serious for agency operations and
can have serious consequences for public confidence in the agency. The integrity impact level
recommended for information management information associated with highly critical
information is high.



                                                114
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Potentially serious adverse effects can be expected in most
government organizations resulting from the unauthorized modification or deletion of
information management information. Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level
recommended for information management information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to information management
information. The effects of disruption of access to information management information may
temporarily impair agency operations. The level of impact depends on the sensitivity of the
information being managed and the criticality of the system to the agency mission. Except for
information needed by real-time processes (e.g., information that feeds real-time monitoring or
audit functions), information management processes are generally tolerant of reasonable
delays. In most cases, disruption of access to information management information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Not many business management systems perform functions for which loss of
availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a
significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
information management information is low.

APPENDIX D: IMPACT DETERMINATION FOR MISSION-BASED
    INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

In general, individual agencies should identify the mission information types processed by their
systems. This Appendix identifies some information types that might be processed by Federal
government organizations. The material includes mission information and potential impacts of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or unavailability of mission information.

The primary purpose for Federal government information systems is to support provision of
basic services to U.S. citizens and residents. This section addresses information types
associated with both services provided by the Federal government to citizens and mechanisms
used to achieve the purposes of government or deliver services for citizens. Delivery
mechanisms include financial vehicles, direct government delivery, and indirect government
delivery. Federal government missions or delivery mechanisms distributed among twenty-five
mission areas and modes of delivery are identified below. Each mission area and delivery mode
corresponds to a Services to Citizens or Mode of Delivery business area as defined in the
Business Reference Model 2.0. There is not a one-to-one mapping of services and delivery modes
to government departments and agencies. Some departments and agencies focus on a single
mission. Others support multiple missions within a mission area. Still others provide services
associated with several different mission areas.

An information type is associated with each Federal government mission and delivery mode.
The identity of each information type is defined by the mission with which it is associated.
Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of sources or
manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in delivering services to
citizens. (See especially the “General Government” functions in Section C.2.8. of Appendix C)
Most of these information types could be included in Appendix D as mission-based information
types. Because the BRM categorizes them as services delivery support functions, they are
included in Section 5 and Appendix C and are not repeated in Appendix D.

The common impact determination factors described in Volume I, Section 3.5, also apply to
mission-based information.

Table 4 is a list of the types of Federal government information treated in this section. The list
and subsequent descriptive information conform to the missions activities and functions
identified in the Office of Management and Budget’s Federal Enterprise Architecture Program
Management Office’s Business Reference Model 2.0. Some of the information types listed in
C.1.7, C.2.5, C.2.8, and C.3.2 are associated with services delivery in the cases of some agencies.
Discussion of these information types is not repeated in this appendix.

Table 5 includes provisional impact assessments for each mission information type or
delivery mode represented in Table 4.

The impact levels assigned to many information types may be context-dependent. For
example, a given information type in some agencies may include information elements, the
compromise of which may endanger human life. In other agencies, the same information
type may not include such elements.

In Table 5, exceptions to provisional impact assignments are flagged by displaying impact
assignments in a gray font [gray font].

Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information that requires
protection at one stage in the system development process may be publicly accessible at a later
stage or following some event. For example, information that has confidentiality attributes
during the period that an agency is using it to make a decision may be public knowledge once the
decision has been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used during development of
requests for proposals in procurement actions).

The following sections describe information attributes that affect impact assessment for each
information type.

D.1 Defense and National Security
Defense and national security operations protect and advance U.S. National Security interests
and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeat threats to those interests. Defense and national
security activities include but military operations, border protection, and intelligence
gathering. Defense operations are subdivided into the following classes:

     •   Strategic National and Theater Defense – Establishing national and multinational
         military objectives, sequencing initiatives, defining limits and assessing risks for the
         use of military and other instruments of national power, developing global plans or
         theater war plans to achieve these objectives, and providing military forces and other
         capabilities in accordance with strategic plans;
     •   Operational Defense – Linking tactics and strategy by establishing operational
         objectives needed to accomplish the strategic objectives, sequencing events to
         achieve the operational objectives, initiating actions, and applying resources to bring
         about and sustain these events; and

     •   Tactical Defense – The ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in
         relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.

Impacts to much information and many information systems associated with defense and
national security missions may affect the security of a broad range of critical infrastructures
and key national assets. Systems that, involve command and control of military forces,
weapons control20, involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system,
are critical to the direct fulfillment of military missions2 or are otherwise employed in strictly
military operations21 are defined under Public Law6 as national security systems.
Information assurance responsibilities are delegated to the Department of Defense for
systems that are operated by the Department of Defense, or another entity on behalf of the




20
   Weapons control involves the actions taken to monitor and protect U.S. weaponry, as well as the oversight and
   control of arms in other countries. Weapons Control applies to conventional, biological, chemical, and nuclear
   weaponry.
21
   Military operations involve the activities that take place during base trainings, military conflicts, and
   peacekeeping missions.


                                                       122
Department of Defense22. Security objectives and impact levels associated with these
systems are determined by the Department of Defense.

D.2 Homeland Security
Homeland Security involves protecting the nation against terrorist attacks. This includes
analyzing threats and intelligence, guarding borders and airports, protecting critical
infrastructure, and coordinating the response emergencies. The Homeland Security Line of
Business is defined by the President’s Strategy on Homeland Security. Note: Some of the
Critical Mission Areas from the President’s strategy are included in other information classes
and categories.

D.2.1 Border and Transportation Security Information Type

Border and Transportation Security includes facilitating or deterring entry and exit of people,
goods, and conveyances at and between U.S. ports of entry, as well as ensuring the security of
transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United
States. Border control involves enforcing the laws regulating the admission of foreign-born
persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. This includes patrolling and monitoring borders and
deportation of illegal aliens. Some border control information is also associated with other
mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation and
surveillance information). In such cases, the impact levels of the associated mission information
may determine impact levels associated with border control information. Some aspects of
ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
within the United States are also covered under the information types associated with the
transportation mission. In some cases the border control information may be classified. Any
classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security
information. The recommended categorization for unclassified border and transportation
security information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of border control
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws regulating the admission of
foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized
disclosure of border control information are usually confined to a single geographic region,
immigration case, or deportation case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious
adverse effect on mission functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place
the agency at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control responsibilities.
Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and deportation activities, unauthorized
disclosure of information can violate privacy policies. Such unauthorized disclosures can have a
serious effect on public confidence in the agency.

     Security, Sec. 3543(c)(2), 12/17/02.


                                                        123
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where border control information is
also associated with other mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal
investigation and surveillance information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the
information may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information may put
the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality impact level associated
with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of confidentiality of information
associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities,
vehicles, and personnel within the United States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities
that endanger human life. In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key
national assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact
level associated with information associated with ensuring security of transportation and
infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is normally
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most border control information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of information can be very serious if the information is critical to
tactical operations.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks,
facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States may seriously affect mission
operations or result in the loss of human life. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting anti-terrorism information may adversely affect mission operations in a
manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures and/or key national assets
or loss of key national assets and/or human life. Consequently, the integrity impact level
associated with information that ensures the security of transportation and infrastructure
networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
border control information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to border control information.
Functions and processes supported by most border control information are not time-critical.
Also, disruption of access will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or
individuals.


                                                124
Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for
example, information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical
threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to interdict. In such
cased, the availability impact will be high.

The consequences of disruption of access to information or information systems associated
with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and
personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are not
reliably tolerant of delays. The availability impact level for information systems that ensure
the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
within the United States is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: Except for such time-critical cases, cases where impact is
driven by information shared with associated missions (e.g., anti-terrorism), the provisional
availability impact level recommended for border control information is normally moderate.

D.2.2 Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection Information Type

Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection involves assessing key asset and critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking direct action to mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance security,
and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy in government operations and personnel. The
Critical Infrastructure Information Protection Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 131-134) places specific
controls on the dissemination of critical infrastructure information (see Volume I, 3.5.2.3).
Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-terrorism information is subject to
security classification. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The
recommended categorization for unclassified anti-terrorism information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of critical infrastructure
protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to monitor and assess the
leadership, motivations, plans, and intentions of foreign and domestic terrorist groups and their
state and non-state sponsors. The effects of unauthorized disclosure of this information can
reasonably be expected to jeopardize fulfillment of critical infrastructure protection missions.
The consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national assets, and human life can be
catastrophic.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for critical infrastructure protection information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting critical infrastructure protection operations



                                                      125
may adversely affect mission operations and result in unacceptable damage to critical
infrastructures, damage to key national assets, or loss of human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
critical infrastructure protection information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to critical infrastructure protection
information. Generally, critical infrastructure protection missions are not reliably tolerant of
delays. Significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences
for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life may occur from disruption
of access to critical infrastructure protection information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
critical infrastructure protection information is high.

D.2.3 Catastrophic Defense Information Type

Catastrophic Defense involves the development of technological countermeasures (chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear [CBRN]) to terrorist threats, conducting laboratory testing on
new and promising devices, and conducting basic and applied science that can lead to the
development of countermeasures. Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-
terrorism information is subject to security classification. National security information is
outside the scope of this guideline. The recommended categorization for unclassified anti-
terrorism information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of catastrophic defense
information on the ability of responsible agencies to monitor and assess the leadership,
motivations, plans, and intentions of foreign and domestic terrorist groups and their state and
non-state sponsors. The effects of unauthorized disclosure of this information can reasonably be
expected to jeopardize fulfillment of catastrophic defense missions. The consequent threat to
human life, critical infrastructures, and key national assets can be catastrophic.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for catastrophic defense information is normally high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting catastrophic defense activities may
adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in loss of human life, unacceptable
damage to critical infrastructures, and/or damage to or loss of key national assets.


                                                      126
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
catastrophic defense information is high.
Availability
The effects of disruption of access to or use of catastrophic defense information or The
availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to catastrophic defense information.
Generally, disruption of access will have a severe adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or
individuals. Also, catastrophic defense missions are not tolerant of delays, with consequences
of significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences for
human life, critical infrastructures, and/or key national assets.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
catastrophic defense information is high.

D.2.4 Executive Functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) Information Type

Executive Functions involve the Executive Office of the President (EOP). Subject to exception
conditions described below, the recommended provisional security categorization for the
executive information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is associated with
functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The effects of loss of confidentiality
of policies and guidance during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and
other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guidance development process.
Premature public release of formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and
review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the EOP. These consequences
may occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Most of the information processed in and by the EOP is classified national security information
and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information processed by the EOP is extremely
sensitive and applicable to homeland security and law enforcement. The unauthorized disclosure
of this extremely sensitive information can seriously imperil human life, key national assets, and
critical infrastructures.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Based on the catastrophic harm that can be suffered by
the nation due to unauthorized disclosure of executive information the provisional confidentiality
impact level recommended for executive functions information is high.




                                                     127
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain EOP information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the government. In the case of the EOP, the impact of such a loss of public
confidence may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
executive information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the executive information. National
defense and critical infrastructure protection aspects of EOP functions are not generally tolerant
of delays. Excessive recovery delays can result in loss of coordination of critical defense and
public welfare processes.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
executive functions information is high.

D.3 Intelligence Operations
Intelligence operations involve the development and management of accurate,
comprehensive, and timely foreign intelligence on national security topics. Systems the
function, operation, or use of which, involve intelligence activities or are critical to the direct
fulfillment of intelligence missions23 are defined under Public Law24 as national security
systems. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of
this guideline. Security objectives and impact levels associated with national security
systems are determined by the head of each agency exercising control of the system25.


23
    Systems that do not involve a) intelligence activities, b) cryptologic activities related to national security, c)
command and control of military forces, d) equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system or 5)
information classified by an act of Congress or under an Executive order are not designated as national security
systems if they are used exclusively for routine business or administrative applications even if they are critical to the
direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Routine business or administrative applications are defined as
including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications. [Federal Information Security
Management Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347, Subchapter III – Information Security, Sec. 3547 – National security

Some agencies are charged with gathering domestic intelligence. Much domestic intelligence
information is classified. Other domestic intelligence information may not be classified (e.g.,
some information obtained from state and local government sources). All classified information
is treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended
categorization for unclassified domestic intelligence information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of domestic intelligence
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage accurate,
comprehensive, and timely domestic intelligence on homeland security topics and other national
threats. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of domestic intelligence information may
include loss of the ability and/or authorization to collect information necessary to provide
warning or to interdict from major threats (e.g., terrorist threats to critical infrastructures and/or
key national assets).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the criticality of much domestic intelligence
information and the severe or catastrophic consequences to agencies that disclose domestic
intelligence information without proper authorization (e.g., Privacy Act provisions, Fourth
Amendment issues), the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for the domestic
intelligence information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Domestic
intelligence information is generally associated with other mission-related information (e.g., anti-
terrorism, firearms and explosive protection, narcotics interdiction). The consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of domestic intelligence information is determined to a
large extent on the missions being supported by the intelligence information and on whether the
intelligence information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
intelligence information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in
unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures, damage to or loss of key national assets, or loss
of human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
domestic intelligence information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to domestic intelligence information.
Generally, missions supported by domestic intelligence information are not reliably tolerant
of delays. Significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic
consequences for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life may result
from disruption of access to domestic intelligence information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
domestic intelligence information is high.

D.4 Disaster Management
Disaster management involves the activities required to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and
repair the effects of all physical and humanitarian disasters whether natural or man-made.
Compromise of much information associated with any of the missions within the disaster
management mission area may seriously impact the security of a broad range of critical
infrastructures and key national assets.

D.4.1 Disaster Monitoring and Prediction Information Type

Disaster monitoring and prediction involves the actions taken to predict when and where a
disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. [Some disaster
management information occurs in humanitarian aid systems under the International Affairs and
Commerce line of business (e.g., State Department disaster preparedness and planning).] The
recommended provisional categorization of the disaster monitoring and protection information
type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring
and prediction information on the ability of responsible agencies to predict when and where a
disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. The purpose of
disaster monitoring and prediction activities is generally to disseminate information. Sharing of
raw information by a diverse group of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of some disaster monitoring and prediction information may include public panic or
other responses that jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention, emergency response, disaster
repair, or restoration missions. For example, attempts of large populations to evacuate in an
endangered area before necessary preparations are made for evacuation routes can result in a
clogging of the routes and failure to evacuate large parts of the population in time to save them
from a life-threatening event. Most of the disaster monitoring and prediction information is
critical in terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage. The unauthorized
release of this information may interfere with disaster prevention or emergency response
missions. The confidentiality impact level recommended for the information cited in the
example can be moderate or high.

The unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information to terrorists may
reveal weak or sensitive points to target, the most effective technique(s use in attacking a target,
and information regarding the status, intent, and plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized
disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information is expected to be of direct use to
terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is recommended to be high.


                                                      130
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact recommended
for most disaster monitoring and prediction information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster monitoring and prediction
information usually depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting disaster monitoring and prediction
information may jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention, and/or emergency response
missions in a manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures, damage to
key national assets, or loss of human life. For example, an integrity compromise that prevents
timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake predictions can have life-
threatening consequences.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
disaster monitoring and prediction information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster monitoring and prediction
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster monitoring and prediction information
are not reliably tolerant of delays. Delays may cost lives and irreplaceable property, e.g.,
degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences for critical
infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life. For example, a loss of availability of
information that prevents timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake
predictions can have life-threatening consequences.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster monitoring and prediction information is high.

D.4.2 Disaster Preparedness and Planning Information Type

Disaster preparedness and planning involves the development of response programs to be used in
case of a disaster. This involves the development of emergency management programs and
activities as well as staffing and equipping regional response centers. The recommended
provisional categorization of the disaster preparedness and planning information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness
and planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop response programs to
be used in case of a disaster. This involves the development of emergency management
programs and activities as well as staffing and equipping regional response centers. The


                                                     131
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most disaster preparedness and planning information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of some disaster preparedness and planning information may include revealing weak
or sensitive critical infrastructure characteristics or inadequate security of U.S. targets to
terrorists or other adversaries. Such information may reveal to an enemy the most effective
technique(s) to use in attacking a target, and/or information regarding the capabilities, intent, and
plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness and planning
information associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets
is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is recommended to be
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most disaster preparedness and planning information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster preparedness and planning
information depend on whether the information is time-critical.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission will usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction
of information can be very serious or catastrophic if the data is time-critical operational
information. In such cases, the impact level assigned would be moderate or high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most disaster preparedness and planning information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster preparedness and planning
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster preparedness and planning
information are not reliably tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: If emergency responders and those
responsible for repair and restoration activities are unable to access preparedness and
planning information in the event of an actual emergency the consequences may include
confusion and delays. In such cases, the availability impact level can be moderate or high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster preparedness and planning information is low.



                                                132
D.4.3 Disaster Repair and Restoration Information Type

Disaster repair and restoration involves the cleanup and restoration activities that take place after
a disaster. This involves the cleanup and rebuilding of any homes, buildings, roads,
environmental resources, or infrastructure that may be damaged due to a disaster. The
recommended provisional categorization of the disaster repair and restoration information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster repair and
restoration information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct cleanup and restoration
activities that take place after a disaster. This involves the cleanup and rebuilding of any homes,
buildings, roads, environmental resources, or infrastructure that may be damaged due to a
disaster. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most disaster repair and restoration
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disaster repair and restoration information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster repair and restoration
information depends on whether the information is time-critical.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most disaster repair and restoration information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster repair and restoration
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster repair and restoration information are
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster repair and restoration information is low.




                                                     133
D.4.4 Emergency Response Information Type

Emergency Response involves the immediate actions taken to respond to a disaster (e.g., wildfire
management). These actions include providing mobile telecommunications, operational support,
power generation, search and rescue, and medical life saving actions. Impacts to emergency
response information and the information systems that process and store emergency response
information could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the
critical emergency services infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked
with emergency response missions. The recommended provisional categorization of the
emergency response information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of emergency response
information on the ability of responsible agencies to respond to a disaster. These actions include
providing mobile telecommunications, operational support, power generation, search and rescue,
and medical life saving actions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of emergency
response information will usually have little or no adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where an attack is
underway, unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information can provide information
that might permit terrorists or other adversaries to target emergency response assets, thus
jeopardizing emergency response resources and missions and public safety. Given the criticality
that much emergency response information has in terms of potential loss of human life and major
property damage, where unauthorized release of information can reasonably be expected to
facilitate interference with emergency response missions, the confidentiality impact level may be
moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s emergency response by another
agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the critical
emergency services infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with
emergency response missions.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for emergency response information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of emergency response information
usually depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of emergency response information may pose a significant threat to major assets
and/or human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
emergency response information is normally high.


                                                      134
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to emergency response information.
Generally, missions supported by emergency response information are not tolerant of delays.
Delays may cost lives and result in major property damage. Denial of access to emergency
response information may result in significant degradation in mission capability and resultant
catastrophic consequences for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
emergency response information is high.

D.5 International Affairs and Commerce
International Affairs and Commerce involves the non-military activities that promote U.S.
policies and interests beyond our national borders, including the negotiation of conflict
resolution, treaties, and agreements. In addition, this function includes: foreign economic
development and social/political development; diplomatic relations with other Nations;
humanitarian, technical and other developmental assistance to key Nations; and global trade.
Information that is protected by procedures established and authorized under criteria specified in
an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interests of foreign policy
are national security related26. Security objectives and impact levels associated with such
national security information are determined by the head of each agency exercising control of
the system6 and are outside the scope of this guideline.

D.5.1 Foreign Relations Information Type

Foreign Relations refers to those activities associated with the implementation of foreign policy
and diplomatic relations, including the operation of embassies, consulates, and other posts;
ongoing membership in international organizations; the development of cooperative frameworks
to improve relations with other Nations; and the development of treaties and agreements.
Conflict resolution involves the mitigation and prevention of disputes stemming from inter and
intra-state disagreements.

Some conflict resolution information is subject to security classification. This classified
information is treated under separate rules established for national security information and is
outside the scope of this guideline.

Treaties and agreements involves the negotiation and implementation of accords with foreign
governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters,
criminal investigations and extraditions, and other various types of foreign policy. When treaties
and agreements information affects intelligence gathering and/or law enforcement cooperation,
impacts to such information and the information systems that process and store the information

                                                        135
could result in negative impacts on protection of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key
national assets.

Some information associated with treaties and agreements is subject to security classification.
This classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security
information. The recommended categorization for unclassified foreign relations information
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution
information on the ability of responsible agencies to mitigate and prevent disputes stemming
from inter and intra-state disagreements. Unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution
information can reasonably be expected to jeopardize fulfillment of conflict resolution missions.
This is particularly true of premature release of resolution factors, personnel profiles, and
proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information that has supported a conflict resolution
process may undo the results of successful conflict resolution processes. The loss of public
confidence in the agency may cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission
capability. Where information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or involvement of
agency personnel in specific prior activities, the effectiveness of those personnel for many future
agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failed conflict resolution
activities may pose threats to human life and major property assets

The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties and agreements information is determined
by the ability of responsible agencies to negotiate and implement accords with foreign
governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters,
criminal investigations and extraditions, and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized
disclosure of information associated with treaties and agreements can reasonably be expected to
prevent successful negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and agreements. This is particularly
true of prematurely released resolution factors, personality assessments, and proposed solutions
to adversaries. Some information that has supported a treaty or other international agreement
process may undo the results of a successfully completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent
threat to public confidence in the agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s
mission capability. When the disclosed information includes candid opinions of agency
personnel, or background information on agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel
for future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failure to
successfully conclude treaties and other international agreements often pose threats to human life
and major property assets.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for foreign relations information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The


                                                     136
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of conflict resolution information
depend on whether the information is time-critical.

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information associated with
treaties and agreements also depend on the time-critical nature of the information. The
unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g.,
web pages, electronic mail) may affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

The unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting conflict resolution
information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in unacceptable
consequences such as loss of human life and/or major property assets.

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be very serious
if the modification is to time-critical operational information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
foreign relations information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to foreign relations information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Diplomatic missions are often
tolerant of delays. Therefore, the availability impact level assigned to information associated
with treaties and agreements that are associated with diplomatic missions is low. Where this
is not the case, the availability impact for foreign relations information associated with
treaties and agreements may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
foreign relations information is moderate.

D.5.2 International Development and Humanitarian Aid Information Type

International Development and Humanitarian Aid refers to those activities related to the
implementation of development and humanitarian assistance programs to developing and
transitioning countries throughout the world. Development and aid may include technical
assistance (the transfer of knowledge and expertise), and the delivery of equipment, commodities
and humanitarian assistance including food aid. In some cases, international development and
humanitarian aid information is subject to security classification. This classified information is
treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended
categorization for unclassified international development and humanitarian aid information
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                    137
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of international
development and humanitarian aid information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute
programs relating to debt relief, foreign investments, poverty alleviation and food relief, foreign
market expansion, and donations, as well as the establishment of policies and procedures to
facilitate economic development.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The unauthorized disclosure of
international development and humanitarian aid information may not directly jeopardize foreign
socio-economic and political development missions. However, the premature disclosure of this
information may adversely affect agency credibility or give unfair competitive advantages to
some candidates for mission support activities. These secondary effects may have a negative
effect on the intended beneficiaries and can result, in extreme cases, in threats to human life,
major assets, or the ability of the agency to perform future missions. Some information that has
supported an international development and humanitarian aid process can even undo the results
of previously completed foreign socio-economic and political development processes. Where
there is a possibility of catastrophic consequences such as threats to human life and major
property assets, a high confidentiality impact level must be assigned.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for international development and humanitarian aid information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of international development and
humanitarian aid information depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of information can be very serious or catastrophic if the modification
is to time-critical operational information. In such cases, the impact level assigned would be
moderate or high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most international development and humanitarian aid information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to international development and
humanitarian aid information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Generally, international development
and humanitarian aid missions are tolerant of delays. Where this is not the case, the


                                                138
availability impact associated with international development and humanitarian aid
information may be moderate or high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
international development and humanitarian aid information is low.

D.5.3 Global Trade Information Type

Global Trade refers to those activities the Federal Government undertakes to advance worldwide
economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the
flow of goods, services, and capital. Trade encompasses all activities associated with the
importing and exporting of goods to and from the United States. This includes goods
declaration, fee payments, and delivery/shipment authorization. Export promotion involves the
development of opportunities for the expansion of U.S. exports. Merchandise inspection
includes the verification of goods and merchandise as well as the surveillance, interdiction, and
investigation of imports/exports in violation of various Customs laws. Tariffs/quotas monitoring
refers to the monitoring and modification of the schedules of items imported and exported to and
from the United States. The recommended categorization for the global trade information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of export promotion
information on the ability of responsible agencies to advance worldwide economic prosperity by
increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the flow of goods, services,
and capital. Also, the confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
merchandise inspection information on the ability of responsible agencies to accurately
determine, report, and record the discovered status of imported or exported merchandise as it
bears on violations of various Customs laws. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of
merchandise inspection information will not jeopardize the completion of other merchandise
inspection missions, as shipment status is generally information of public record. The
confidentiality impact level is also the effect of unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas
monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws,
and preserve statistical data concerning the historical compliance with such laws. Typically, the
unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas monitoring information will not jeopardize the
completion of other tariffs/quotas monitoring missions because the information is publicly
available.

Unauthorized disclosure of information that has supported an export promotion process may
undo the results of successful export promotion processes. The consequent threat to agency
image or reputations can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability.
Consequently, the general confidentiality impact level associated with export promotion
information is high. Some information that has supported a tariffs/quotas monitoring process




                                                      139
might be of higher sensitivity, such as intelligence information27 that might point to a dumping
situation. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of future
tariffs/quotas monitoring processes. Consequently, the confidentiality impact level associated
with tariffs/quotas monitoring information is high.

Intelligence information is included in national security systems. National security information
and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

Some information that has supported a merchandise inspection process might be of higher
sensitivity. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of
future merchandise inspection processes. The consequent threat to agency image or reputations
may cause a serious adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general
confidentiality impact level associated with merchandise inspection information is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for global trade information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of global trade information depends
on whether the information is time-critical.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting export promotion information
may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions.

Trade agreements that have been implemented are generally matters of public record. Therefore,
the specific negotiated terms, etc., must be accurately recorded.

The modification of merchandise inspection information may result in significant financial
consequences to an importer or exporter whose shipment is in question and may adversely affect
mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions. The results of
completed inspections are matters of public record and must be accurately recorded.

For tariffs/quotas monitoring information, the requirement for adequate means to detect data
corruption is high. This information is used in policy and strategic analysis, and the accuracy of
this statistical information is critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
affecting tariffs/quotas monitoring information may adversely affect mission operations and
result in potentially catastrophic economic repercussions.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
global trade information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to global trade information.

Export promotion and merchandise inspection missions are generally tolerant of significant
delays. If the export promotion and merchandise inspection information are time-critical, the
availability impact may be high. This would be the case where such an occurrence could
result in significant financial consequences as a result of uncertainty regarding the status of
an imported or exported shipment.

Tariffs/quotas monitoring missions are also tolerant of significant delays. Typically, this
information is used in high level policy and strategic analysis, and denial of access might
cause an inconvenience but no significant mission impact. However, the availability impact
associated with tariffs/quotas monitoring information may be high, if denial of access could
result in serious damage to the image or reputation of an agency resulting from uncertainty
regarding the compliance statistics of a major sovereign trade partner.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
global trade information is high.

D.6 Natural Resources
The Natural Resources mission area includes all activities involved in conservation planning,
land management, and national park/monument tourism that affect the nation's natural and
recreational resources, both private and federal. Note: Energy-related natural resources are
covered in the Energy Management mission area.

D.6.1 Water Resource Management Information Type

Water Resource Management includes all activities that promote the effective use and
management of the nation’s water resources. Notes: Environmental protection of water resources
is included in the Environmental Management Line of Business. Hydroelectric energy
production is included under the Energy Production mission. The recommended provisional
categorization of the water resource management information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of water resource
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote the effective use and
management of the nation’s water resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
most water resource management information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


                                                     141
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which
moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry
development. For example, unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency water resource
management activities and plans may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to
competing interests. Consistent premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant
degradation in mission capability.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for water resource management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of water resource management
information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications associated with water resource
management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most water resource management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to water resource management
information. Generally, missions supported by water resource management information are
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
water resource management information is low.

D.6.2 Conservation, Marine and Land Management Information Type

Conservation, Marine and Land Management involves the responsibilities of surveying,
maintaining, and operating public lands and monuments, as well as activities devoted to ensuring
the preservation of land, water, wildlife, and natural resources, both domestically and
internationally. It also includes the sustainable stewardship of natural resources on federally
owned/controlled lands for commercial use (mineral mining, grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). The
recommended provisional categorization of the conservation, marine, and land management
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     142
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of conservation, marine,
and land management information on the ability of responsible agencies to survey, maintain, and
operate public lands and monuments, as well as to ensure the preservation of land, water,
wildlife, and natural resources, both domestically and internationally. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most conservation, marine, and land management information would
have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which
moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of private or
proprietary information associated with use of federally owned/controlled lands for commercial
use (mineral mining, grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). Additionally, unauthorized disclosure of
details of current agency conservation, marine, and land management activities and plans may
focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests. Consistent premature
disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation in mission capability. Also,
conservation, marine, and land management include enforcement functions (e.g., the policing of
marine fisheries). Confidentiality impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the
confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact recommended
for most conservation, marine, and land management information is low.

D.7 Energy
Energy refers to all actions performed by the government to ensure the procurement and
management of energy resources, including the production, sale and distribution of energy, as
well as the management of spent fuel resources. Energy management includes all types of mass-
produced energy (e.g., hydroelectric, nuclear, wind, solar, or fossil fuels). Also included in this
mission area is the oversight of private industry.

D.7.1 Energy Supply Information Type

Energy Supply involves all activities devoted to ensuring the availability of an adequate supply
of energy for the United States and its citizens. Energy Supply includes the sale and
transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This
function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage
located near the point of use. Impacts to some information and information systems associated
with energy supply may affect the security of critical infrastructures, particularly in the areas of
energy transmission and transport. The following recommended provisional categorization of the
energy supply information type is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure
elements or nuclear materials are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low28), (integrity, Low22), (availability, Low29)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply
information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities related to the sale and
transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This
function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage
located near the point of use. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of energy supply information can have a serious economic impact with respect to
competitive advantages and financial and commodity market dynamics. Also, the unauthorized
disclosure of supply information may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption
of energy distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly
catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy supply
information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to be high.


28
   Risk level is usually high where safety of radioactive materials, highly flammable fuels, or major transmission
   channels or control processes is at risk.
29
   Risk level is usually moderate or high where time-critical processes are involved.


                                                        147
[Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified. The
classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline.
Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is
not national security information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.]

With respect to possible use by terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum,
natural gas, and other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must
include energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also
susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products is involved,
there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of human life and major
property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be moderate or high. [Disclosure of
transportation routes and storage facilities is often (i) both authorized and necessary to mission
accomplishment and (ii) authorized, or even mandated, for public safety reasons.] Also, the
unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s energy supply information by another agency could
result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the energy distribution
infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with energy supply.

(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most business and industry development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to business and industry development
information. Missions supported by business and industry development information are
generally tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
business and industry development information is low.

D.9.2 Intellectual Property Protection Information Type

Intellectual property protection involves law enforcement activities involving the enforcement of
intellectual property including inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names,
images, and designs used in commerce. Note that intellectual property protection is an exception
to the often-close relationship between impacts to law enforcement information and information
systems and the security of critical infrastructures and key national assets. The following security
categorization is recommended for the intellectual property protection information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of intellectual property
protection information on the abilities of responsible agencies to enforce intellectual property
including inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used
in commerce. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of intellectual
property protection information will result in, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There are legislative mandates
prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a
moderate confidentiality impact level. In the case of patent activities, technical details of
applications involving inventions with military applications and with deliberations concerning
withholding patents as a result of national security considerations may be sensitive. (In some


                                                     157
cases, the patent application information may be classified or to contain information concerning
weapons or weapons systems. In such cases, the information would be national security
information, and outside the scope of this guideline.)

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for intellectual property protection information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of intellectual property protection
information depends on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission
capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. The effects of modification or
deletion of this information are generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or
assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
intellectual property protection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to intellectual property protection
information. The nature of intellectual property protection processes is tolerant of reasonable
delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
intellectual property protection information is low.

D.9.3 Financial Sector Oversight Information Type

Financial Sector Oversight involves the regulation of private sector firms and markets (stock
exchanges, corporations, etc.) to protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and illegal behavior.
This also includes deposit protection. The recommended provisional categorization of the
financial sector oversight information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of financial sector
oversight information on the ability of responsible agencies to regulate private sector firms and
markets (stock exchanges, corporations, etc.) to protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and
illegal behavior. This also includes deposit protection, creation, regulation, and control of the
nation’s currency and coinage supply and demand.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: While the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of some financial sector oversight information would have only a limited


                                                    158
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals, there are significant
exceptions. Unauthorized disclosure of much financial sector oversight information can result in
major financial consequences. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such
information.

In some cases, premature disclosure of regulatory information can impact major financial
markets and damage national banking and finance infrastructures. For example, unauthorized
disclosure of a decision to increase the money supply or of an ongoing securities fraud
investigation can have a dramatic effect on financial markets. This can result in assignment of a
high impact level to such information.

Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major banking institution or brokerage
house), could damage faith in regulatory institutions and result in even more market disruption
and have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. This can
result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Even where the consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single
financial or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on
public confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result in assignment of a high impact
level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for financial sector oversight information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. T he
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of financial sector oversight
information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail)
may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where unauthorized modification or
destruction of financial sector oversight information facilitates or enables catastrophic
consequences, the integrity impact level may be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most financial sector oversight information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to financial sector oversight
information. Missions supported by financial sector oversight information are generally
tolerant of delay.



                                               159
Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
financial sector oversight information is low.

D.9.4 Industry Sector Income Stabilization Information Type

Industry Sector Income Stabilization involves all programs and activities devoted to assisting
adversely impacted industrial sectors (farming, commercial transportation, etc.) to ensure the
continued availability of their services for the American public and the long-term economic
stability of these sectors. The provisional recommended security categorization for the industry
sector income stabilization information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of industry sector
income stabilization information on the ability of responsible agencies to assist adversely
impacted industrial sectors (farming, commercial transportation, etc.) to ensure the continued
availability of their services for the American public and the long-term economic stability of
these sectors. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of industry sector income stabilization
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
However, unauthorized premature disclosure of Federal government plans for industry sector
income stabilization actions (e.g., grants or subsidies) as well as of government economic
forecasts and commentary preliminary to formulation of plans may result in major financial
consequences. Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major
manufacturing institution, a major agribusiness institution, or a commodity brokerage house),
could damage confidence in economic stabilization institutions and have a severe adverse effect
on public confidence in the government.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for industry sector income stabilization information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Industry sector
income stabilization activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects
of unauthorized modification or destruction of industry sector income stabilization information
on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
industry sector income stabilization information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to industry sector income stabilization
information. Industry sector income stabilization processes are generally tolerant of delay. In
most cases, disruption of access to industry sector income stabilization information can be


                                                    160

D.10.3 Social Services Information Type

Social Services are designed to provide meaningful opportunities for social and economic growth
of the disadvantaged sector of the population in order to develop individuals into productive and
self-reliant citizens and promote social equity. Included in this category are social welfare
services extended to children and adults with special needs, such as the orphaned, neglected,
abandoned, disabled, etc. Such services include family life education and counseling, adoption,
guardianship, foster family care, rehabilitation services, etc. Note: This mission does not include
services that are primarily for income support (Income Security) or are an integral part of some
other mission area (e.g., Health, Workforce Management, etc.). The recommended provisional
categorization of the social services information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of social services
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide meaningful opportunities for social
and economic growth of the disadvantaged sector of the population in order to develop


                                                     163
individuals into productive and self-reliant citizens and promote social equity. The consequences
of unauthorized disclosure of most social services information would have a limited adverse

D.10.4 Postal Services Information Type

Postal Services provide for the timely and consistent exchange and delivery of mail and packages
between businesses, organizations, and residents of the United States or between businesses,


                                                164
organizations, and residents of the United States and the rest of the world. It also includes the
nation-wide retail infrastructure required to make Postal Services easily accessible to customers.
(Note: The commercial function of mail is more closely aligned with the “Business and Industry
Development” mission in the “Economic Development mission area.” The international
commercial function of mail is more closely aligned with the “Global Trade” mission in the
“International Affairs” mission area). The recommended provisional categorization of thee postal
services information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of postal services
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide for the timely and consistent

the United States or between businesses, organizations, and residents of the United States and the
rest of the world. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most postal services
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences include privacy information (e.g., information required
by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to
protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Other exceptions
include unauthorized disclosure of information that might assist criminals to perpetrate fraud,
particularly with respect to income security disbursements. Because registered mail can be
employed to transmit classified information, information regarding some registered mail can
facilitate unauthorized access to national security information. This can result in assignment of a
moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most postal services information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of postal services information would
have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of postal information might provide terrorists the tools to carry out an
attack. The consequences in terms of critical infrastructure protection and risk to human life may
be severe. In such cases, the integrity impact of compromise would be high. Another threat is


                                                    165
that of unauthorized modification of information to support fraudulent activities (e.g.,

                                                     166
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some regulatory and tariff
enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and goods over land
involve relatively sensitive information. These are included in Law Enforcement. Unauthorized
disclosure of accident investigation information that has not yet been adequately researched,
coordinated, or edited can result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations.
Loss in public confidence is a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information
associated with ground transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to
privacy laws (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, HIPAA). (The Privacy Act Information provisional
impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In
such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure may be moderate.

Some military ground transportation information is national security information and is outside
the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for ground transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of ground transportation
information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some ground transportation functions are
time-critical (e.g., track switching functions associated with rail travel). Unauthorized

or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of accident
investigation information that has not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can
result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is
a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with water
transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Some military sea and water transportation information is national security information and is
outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for water transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of water transportation
information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some water and sea transportation
functions are time-critical (e.g., distress signals, docking operations, collision avoidance,
warnings of hazardous weather or sea conditions). Unauthorized modification or destruction of



                                                     168
time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and
in loss of human lives. Such information would have a high integrity impact level.
Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be
included in water transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances
when errors in frequency assignment information can result in an inability for Federal
government agencies to communicate with state or local government activities. The subsequent
loss of communications capabilities can result in life-threatening situations. Such information
would have a high integrity impact level.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
water transportation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to water transportation information.

human lives. Such information would have a high integrity impact level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
water transportation information is low.

D.11.3 Air Transportation Information Type

Air Transportation involves the activities related to the safe passage of passengers or goods
through the air. It also includes command and control activities related to the safe movement of
aircraft through all phases of flight for commercial and military operations. Note: The protection
of air transportation from deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information
type under the Homeland Security mission area. The general recommended security
categorization for the air transportation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of air transportation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the safe passage of passengers and
goods through the air. The protection of air transportation from deliberate attack is included in
the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland Security mission area. Some
regulatory and tariff enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and
goods over land involve sensitive information. These are treated under Law Enforcement. In



                                                     169
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of air transportation information will have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of accident
investigation information that has not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can
result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is
a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with air
transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. The
sensitivity of air transportation information can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger
lists are not releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed in the public
domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from
unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Also, much military air transport information is national security information and is outside the
scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for air transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Many air
transportation functions do not process time-critical information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Many air transportation functions are time-
critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, weather reports for the terminal
area, maintenance trouble reports). Communications management (e.g., frequency management)
information also needs to be included in air transportation integrity impact considerations. There
may be circumstances under which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a
loss of communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss of
communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized modification or
destruction of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale
property loss and in loss of human lives. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
supplements the availability and integrity of position information available from the DoD's
Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of
integrity of this system, a high integrity impact level is recommended.

The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level:
Systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (the NAS systems) have been
designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability issues are closely linked.
The loss of integrity in a system is monitored continuously, and the loss of integrity is treated as
a loss of availability, and in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not
cause derogation in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing
System are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed from
service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service is not available. In


                                                 170
most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued availability with degraded integrity.
The impacts of the loss of availability due to the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic
delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays,
diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is assumed to be
inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. With the controls
implemented, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for most
air transportation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to air transportation information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Many air transportation functions are
time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, weather reports for the
terminal area, maintenance trouble reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information
necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives.
Timing plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For
example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or hours in the
case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing approach, up to the
second availability may be required (e.g., detection of microbursts in the terminal area). Air
operations are not tolerant of information loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
supplements the availability of information available from the Department of Defense's Global
Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of
availability of this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability
impact.
The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: The
systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (the NAS systems) have been designed
for robust operations. However, in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not
cause derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of availability due to the loss
of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc.,
and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm
because the loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate
failures. With the controls implemented, the Recommended Availability Impact Level is moderate.


Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most air transportation information is low.

D.11.4 Space Operations Information Type

Space Operations involves the activities related to the safe launches/missions of passengers or

Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of space operations
information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct safe launches/missions of
passengers or goods into space and includes commercial, scientific, and military operations. The
protection of space operations from deliberate attack involves military operations (D.1),
homeland security operations (D.2), and law enforcement operations (D.16). In most cases,
unauthorized disclosure of space operations information will have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Civilian space operations are intended
to be conducted in the open. Administrative and business functions associated with space
operations may involve proprietary, procurement-sensitive, and Privacy Act information. The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from
unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Some information regarding space operations (particularly military operations) is classified

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for space operations information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Space
operations are typically characterized by critical operational timing and safety parameters, and
low tolerance for error. Unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical information
necessary to these functions may result in significant property loss and loss of human lives.
Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be
included in integrity impact determination for space operations. Erroneous frequency
assignment information can result in loss of communications with spacecraft that can endanger
mission operations and human safety.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
space operations information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to space operations information.

governing proprietary information and procurement management. In some cases, unauthorized
disclosure of this information such as privacy-protected medical records can have serious
consequences for agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most health care services information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Many activities associated with health care services are not time critical and the adverse effects
of unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency will be limited. However, the consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information may result in incorrect,
inappropriate, or excessively delayed treatment of patients. In these cases, serious adverse
effects can include legal actions and danger to human life. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications that contain health care
information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and public
confidence in the agency and the agency mission.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Because of the potential for the loss of human life, the
provisional integrity impact level recommended for health care services information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to health care information. Except for
cases of emergency actions necessary to correct urgent threats to patient health, health care
processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some health care information is time-
critical and is dependent on the severity of the health threat(s) and the rapidity with which the
threat is spreading/growing. Delays in the communication of specific situations may be life
threatening. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such
information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
health care services information is low.

D.14.5 Consumer Health and Safety Information Type

Consumer Health and Safety supports activities associated with the inspection, education, and
evaluation of consumer products to assess the potential risks and dangers they may present to the
consumer (both humans and animals), (i.e. food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other consumer
products). Impacts to some information and information systems associated with quality
assurance of food and pharmaceuticals may affect the security of critical agriculture and food
and public health infrastructures. In such cases, integrity and availability impacts can be high.
However, in general, the following provisional security categorization is recommended for the
consumer health and safety information type:




                                                185
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of consumer health and
safety information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform inspection, education and
evaluation functions involving food, pharmaceuticals and other consumer products. Most
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of consumer health and safety information are unlikely
to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The most serious adverse effects are
likely to involve exposure of information that is proprietary to an organization being evaluated
by the agency. [Unauthorized disclosure of some information can have serious economic impact
on both individual companies and the broader market place. The consequences of such
unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.] This
can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for consumer health and safety information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of consumer health and safety
information can be serious if the public is exposed to mislabeled, tainted, or otherwise harmful
food, drugs, or consumer products.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations and public confidence in the agency and the agency mission. In some
cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can result in loss of human life.
This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
consumer health and safety information remains at least moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to health and safety information.
Consumer products quality assurance processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Delays in the communication of product
deficiencies may be life threatening. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such
information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
consumer health and safety information is low.


                                                    186
D.15 Income Security
Income Security includes activities designed to ensure that members of the public are provided
with the necessary means – both financial and otherwise – to sustain an adequate level of
existence. This includes all benefit programs, both earned and unearned, that promote these
goals for members of the public.

D.15.1 General Retirement and Disability Information Type

General Retirement and Disability involves the development and management of retirement
benefits, pensions, and income security for those who are retired or disabled. Related
information types affecting qualification and disbursement of benefits are discussed in Appendix
C’s Sections C.2.8.8, C.2.8.9, C.2.8.10, C.2.8.11, and C.3.2.5. The recommended provisional
categorization of the general retirement and disability information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general retirement and
disability information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage retirement
benefits, pensions, and income security for those who are retired or disabled. The consequences
of limited unauthorized disclosure of retirement and disability information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

The disclosure of privacy information (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or
other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of
individuals) may have serious consequences. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.
Unauthorized disclosure of large amounts of general retirement and disability information may
result in significant damage to an agency’s image or operation.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact recommended for general
retirement and disability information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.
Generally, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general retirement
and disability information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals. However, where provision of retirement and/or disability benefits is a
primary agency service delivery mission, the consequences can be more severe.




                                                    187
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Integrity compromises may result in
reduction of benefits– and in extreme cases can be life threatening. This can result in assignment
of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general retirement and disability information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general retirement and disability
information. The effects of disruption of access to general retirement and disability information
or information systems would have, in many cases, a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where provision of retirement and/or
disability benefits is a primary agency service delivery mission, the consequences can be more
severe. Availability compromises may result in reduction of benefits – and in extreme cases can
be life threatening. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general retirement and disability information is moderate.

D.15.2 Unemployment Compensation Information Type

Unemployment Compensation provides income security to those who are no longer employed,
while they seek new employment. The recommended provisional categorization of the
unemployment compensation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of unemployment
compensation information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide income security to
those who are no longer employed, while they seek new employment. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most unemployment compensation information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information (e.g., information
required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. This can
result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for unemployment compensation information is low.

D.16 Law Enforcement
Law enforcement involves the protection of people, places, and things from criminal activity
resulting from non-compliance with U.S. laws. This includes patrols, undercover operations,
response to emergency calls, as well as arrests, raids, and seizures of property. Impacts to
some information and information systems associated with law enforcement missions may
affect the security of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets. Some
information associated with Federal law enforcement is categorized as national security
information. Rules governing establishment of impact levels and controls associated with
national security information are governed by a separate set of policies and are outside the
scope of this guideline. Confidentiality and integrity impacts are often determined by
statutory and regulatory requirements that vary by violation.


                                                192
D.16.1 Criminal Apprehension Information Type

Criminal apprehension supports activities associated with the tracking and capture of groups or
individuals believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes. The recommended
provisional categorization of the criminal apprehension information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension
information on the ability of responsible agencies to track and capture groups or individuals
believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes, on public safety, and on the safety of
law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
apprehension information depend 1) on the seriousness of the crime involved, 2) on the
capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure or kill civilians or law enforcement
officials, 3) timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to
facilitate a crime or evade capture), and 4) statutory and regulatory requirements which vary by
violation.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not
violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part
of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. For many crimes that are the
responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with
unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information must often be assumed to pose a
threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. In such cases, confidentiality impact level
is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: For most Federal law enforcement systems that
support criminal apprehension activities the harm that results from unauthorized disclosure will
be limited. Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for criminal
apprehension information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal apprehension information
may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed and on the success of
subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail)
may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of criminal apprehension information may have an adverse effect on the subsequent prosecution
of the apprehended criminal. Consequently, a serious adverse effect on agency operations can
result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. In such cases, the integrity


                                                    193
impact level recommended for criminal apprehension information is at least moderate. When
the criminal apprehension information is time-critical, the unauthorized modification or
destruction of this information may have a severe or catastrophic effect on public confidence in
the agency, pose a significant threat to major assets, and/or pose a threat to human life. This is
applicable for many crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies. For
this criminal apprehension information, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: For most Federal law enforcement systems that support
criminal apprehension activities the harm that results from unauthorized modification or
destruction will be limited. Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal apprehension information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal apprehension information.
Missions supported by criminal apprehension information are not typically tolerant of delay.
While there are many cases in which elements of criminal apprehension information are not
urgent, there are many in which relatively short periods of unavailability can pose a threat to
human life and/or result in a loss of major assets.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most criminal apprehension information is moderate.

D.16.2 Criminal Investigation and Surveillance Information Type

Criminal investigation and surveillance includes the collection of evidence required to determine
responsibility for a crime and the monitoring and questioning of affected parties. The
recommended provisional categorization of the criminal investigation and surveillance
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation
and surveillance information on the ability of responsible agencies to collect evidence required to
determine responsibility for a crime, to monitor and question affected parties, and to protect the
safety of witnesses and law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of criminal investigation and surveillance information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime
involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal30 to access the information and use it to
facilitate a crime, to evade detection or surveillance, or eliminate probable cause for searches and
warrants), and 3] on the capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure witnesses or law
enforcement officials.



30
     In this case, the term “criminal entity” includes both the criminal and legal representative(s) of the criminal (i.e.,
     council).


                                                             194
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not
violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part
of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of
the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences
associated with unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information
must often be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets.
Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular concern.
In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and
surveillance information depends on the urgency with which the information is needed and on
the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Where unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and surveillance
information can have an adverse effect on the granting or execution of a search or wiretap
warrant or on the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal a serious
adverse effect on agency operations can result. This can place the agency at a significant
disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, major investigations can be
jeopardized when the time-critical criminal investigation and surveillance information is
modified or destroyed. Where the criminal case under investigation involves major property
losses, large-scale financial frauds that have serious implications for financial markets, poses a
threat to key national assets or human life, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high. In
international matters, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign
nationals might be involved, the integrity impact level for criminal investigation and surveillance
information will be high. Any compromise of such information could result in catastrophic
adverse effects on future operations, individual and agency reputations, and on human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal investigation and surveillance
information. Missions supported by criminal investigation and surveillance information are not
always tolerant of delay.


                                                 195
Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are some cases in which relatively
short periods of unavailability of criminal investigation and surveillance information may result
in lost surveillance opportunities or opportunities to make an arrest. Where the crimes involved
pose a threat to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level
recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.

D.16.3 Citizen Protection Information Type

Citizen protection involves all activities performed to protect the general population of the
United States from criminal activity. The following security categorization is recommended for
the citizen protection information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate, (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of citizen protection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect the general population of the United
States from criminal activity. In some cases, the criminal activity is terrorist activity intended to
cause mass casualties. While the results of unauthorized disclosure of most citizen protection
information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, the exceptions
can have catastrophic consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of citizen protection information could be severe. If detailed intelligence information
regarding a planned terrorist act was disclosed, the terrorists might succeed in countering the
protection measures and carry out a devastating attack. The confidentiality impacts associated
with information concerning defensive dispositions would be high. While the adverse effects of
unauthorized disclosure of some citizen protection information on law enforcement operations,
assets, and individuals are limited; the stakes are usually higher. Federal citizen protection
activities often seek to protect the public against life-threatening situations or against loss of
major assets.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most citizen protection information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of citizen protection information may
pose a potential threat to public safety particularly if the protective measures are compromised.




                                                    196
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., terrorist threats),
unauthorized modification or destruction of citizen protection information can result in loss of
human life - a high-impact potential.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
citizen protection information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to citizen protection information. Many
citizen protection missions are usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Most criminal activity
against citizen protection information is not life threatening but can result in serious property
loss.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Emergency situations or elevated
terrorist threat conditions are not tolerant of delays. Where systems support time-sensitive
operations for life-threatening situations, the availability impact level for citizen protection
information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: In the case of most systems that support delivery of citizen
protection services, the provisional availability impact level recommended for citizen protection
information is moderate.

D.16.4 Leadership Protection Information Type

Leadership protection involves all activities performed to protect the health and well being of the
president, vice-president, their families, and other high-level government officials. Some
leadership protection information may be classified. All classified information is treated under
separate rules established for national security information and is outside the scope of this
guideline. The recommended provisional categorization for unclassified leadership protection
information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of leadership protection
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to protect the health and well being of the
president, vice-president, their families, and other high-level government officials. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most leadership protection information are not
directly life-threatening but can have serious consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: For the unauthorized disclosure of
information that can facilitate efforts to assassinate Federal leadership, the consequences not
only pose a threat to human life, but can also have a disruptive effect on the continuity of Federal
government operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.




                                                    197
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the nature of most leadership protection
information, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for the information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. That is, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of leadership protection information
may be determined by the specific operation(s) supported by the information. In addition, the
consequences may depend on the urgency with which the intelligence information is needed.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of Secret Service operations,
unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting leadership protection
information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in loss of human
life and disruption of government operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most leadership protection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to leadership protection information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of Secret Service operations,
missions supported by leadership protection information are not tolerant of delays with resultant
catastrophic consequences for mission capability and human life. In such cases, the availability
impact level is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most leadership protection information is low.

D.16.5 Property Protection Information Type

Property protection entails all activities performed to ensure the security of civilian and
government property. The recommended provisional categorization of the property protection
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of property protection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the security of civilian and
government property. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection
information are generally dependent on the nature of the property being protected. Where the
property being protected is neither critical to agency operations nor of such value that its loss




                                                     198
would degrade mission capability or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized
disclosure would have a limited adverse effect.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where critical infrastructure facilities
or key national assets are being protected, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
property protection information might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists
or other adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information
associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets is expected
to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Most protected facilities are not part of national security, the critical infrastructure, or key
national asset categories. If unauthorized disclosure of property protection information resulted
in damage to these facilities, serious adverse effects on agency operations and assets could
reasonably be expected to result. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact
level to such information.

Where the property being protected involves classified information, the property protection
information itself might be classified. Some examples include command and control and other
military facilities, foreign intelligence collection or processing facilities, weapons or weapons
facilities, and cryptographic activities. National security information is outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for property protection information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of property protection information
depends on the type of property being protected and on the immediacy with which the
information is expected to be used. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure can be expected to
have limited adverse consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. However, the potential damage to
the protection mission will usually be of greater concern. If the modified or destroyed
information is tactical i.e., time-critical, there is a greater potential for actions being taken based
on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on protection
operation. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information. .

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most property protection information is low.




                                                  199
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to property protection information.
Missions supported by property protection information are not typically tolerant of delays, but
the consequences of loss of availability of most property protection information are limited.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of inability of guard
forces and other emergency responders to receive property protection information in a timely
manner may result in catastrophic consequences for properties that could include critical
infrastructures and key national assets. In general, the availability impact level assigned to
property protection information is dependent on what is being protected. This can result in
assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact recommended for most
property protection information is low.

D.16.6 Substance Control Information Type

Substance control supports activities associated with the enforcement of legal substances (i.e.,
alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale,
distribution, and other related activities. The provisional security categorization recommended
for the substance control information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of substance control
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce legal substances (i.e., alcohol and
tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other
related activities. Unauthorized disclosure of a significant proportion of substance control
information can compromise investigations, cause apprehension operations to fail, and
compromise prosecutions. This can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations and place
the agency at a significant disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
routine substance control information is unlikely to have more than a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The confidentiality impact associated with
such information is low.

Where the unauthorized disclosure of information exposes sensitive information sources or
compromises investigative or interdiction operations, the consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of substance control information may have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, significantly degrade mission capability, and/or pose a threat to human life. Where
unauthorized disclosure endangers investigations in process, investigative or intelligence
information sources, or information regarding witnesses or other critical case file elements, the




                                                    200
danger to human life and key agency missions can be significant. Where unauthorized disclosure
endangers witnesses or law enforcement officers, the impact level must be rated as high.

Other factors affecting confidentiality impacts associated with substance control information are
discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal
Investigation and Surveillance).

Some substance control information is classified (e.g., some intelligence-derived information).
Classified information and other national security information are outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most substance control information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The amount of
money available to perpetrators significantly increases the insider threat. The consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be serious if the information is
critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to most missions would
usually be limited

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information (particularly time-critical information) affecting internal
communications can jeopardize investigations, prosecutions, the lives of witnesses, and the
safety of enforcement officers. In some cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of
information can result in loss of human life. In such cased, the integrity impact level is high.

Other factors affecting integrity impacts associated with substance control information are
discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal
Investigation and Surveillance).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Because the consequences of unauthorized modification or
destruction of information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations (i.e.,
is time-critical), the provisional integrity impact level recommended for substance control
information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to substance control information. Most
substance control processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of unavailability of
information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical.


                                                  201
Failure of some processes during tactical operations can result in both threats to human life and
severe harm to public confidence in the agency. The impact level assigned to information and
information systems associated with these tactical processes is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most substance control information is moderate.

D.16.7 Crime Prevention Information Type

Crime prevention entails all efforts designed to create safer communities through the control and
reduction of crime by addressing the causes of crime and reducing the opportunities of crime.
The recommended provisional security categorization for the crime prevention information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention
information on the ability of responsible agencies to create safer communities through the
control and reduction of crime by addressing the causes of crime and reducing the opportunities
of crime. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention information will have only
a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of crime
prevention programs are sensitive (e.g., location of actively monitored surveillance cameras
where only a fraction of camera feeds are monitored). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of
crime prevention information might have a serious adverse effect on crime prevention operations
by eliminating uncertainty regarding surveillance patterns. Therefore, the confidentiality impact
might be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for crime prevention information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Crime
prevention activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of crime prevention information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency would be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
crime prevention information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to crime prevention information. Most


                                                     202
crime prevention processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to crime
prevention information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., orders
associated with deployment of officers to provide a crime-discouraging presence in developing
threat situations), loss of availability of information can have a serious adverse effect on crime
prevention operations. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
crime prevention information is low.

D.16.8 Trade Law Enforcement Information Type

Trade law enforcement refers to the enforcement of anti-boycott, international loan, and
general trade laws. The security categorization recommended for the trade law enforcement
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws.
Unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information could potentially jeopardize
fulfillment of other trade law enforcement missions. Some information that has supported a
trade law enforcement process might be of higher sensitivity, and unauthorized disclosure of this
information might jeopardize the success of future trade law enforcement processes. The
subsequent threat to agency image or reputation can cause a serious adverse effect on an
agency’s mission capability. Where information includes names of informants, informant
contacts, or agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel in future enforcement
activities can be permanently impaired, or their lives threatened.

Intelligence information falls under national security systems. National security information and
national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most trade law enforcement information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of trade law enforcement information
may depend on whether the information is time-critical. The compromise of trade law
enforcement information can be serious or, in some cases, catastrophic if the information is time-
critical. Also, the results of trade law enforcement activities may become matters of public
record, and thus must be accurately recorded.



                                                    203
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting trade law enforcement information may adversely affect mission
operations and result in unacceptable consequences such as loss of human life. The compromise
of trade law enforcement information can be serious or catastrophic if the information is time-
critical. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most trade law enforcement information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to trade law enforcement information.
The effects of disruption of access to trade law enforcement information or information systems
can be serious or, in some cases, catastrophic if the information is time-critical. Trade law
enforcement missions are typically intolerant of significant time delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most trade law enforcement information is moderate.

D.17 Litigation and Judicial Activities
Litigation and judicial activities involve all activities necessary for the development and
oversight of Federal programs.

D.17.1 Judicial Hearings Information Type

Judicial hearings include activities associated with conducting a hearing in a court of law to
settle a dispute. The general recommended security categorization for the judicial hearings
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of judicial hearings
information on the ability of responsible entities to conducting a hearing in a court of law to
settle a dispute. While much information associated with judicial hearings is public, some
information is sealed by the court and unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, fine and/or
imprisonment. In the vast majority of cases, unauthorized disclosure of judicial hearings
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or
informant may be endangered by unauthorized disclosure, the confidentiality impact is high.
Also, where the consequences are likely to endanger public safety, the confidentiality impact is
high.



                                                    204
Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the consequences of unauthorized disclosure,
the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for judicial hearings information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Judicial
hearings activities are not typically time-critical. Modification or destruction of court records can
result in disruption or jeopardy to legal proceedings. In most cases, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of judicial hearings information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
judicial hearings information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to judicial hearings information. Most
judicial hearings processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to judicial
hearings information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on government
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., orders
associated with wiretap or search warrants), loss of availability of information can have a serious
or severe adverse effect. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate or high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
judicial hearings information is low.

D.17.2 Legal Defense Information Type

Legal defense refers to the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law in an
attempt to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. The sensitivity of much legal
information is highly lifecycle-dependent. From a confidentiality perspective, most information
associated with litigation and judicial activities is in the public record after the information has
been presented in court. The recommended provisional security categorization for the legal
defense information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, High), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal defense
information on the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law and on the ability
of the government to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. Dissemination of
legal defense information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure,
Rules of Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While much


                                                     205
information associated with legal defense is public, some information is sealed by the court or is
otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is
punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized
disclosure of legal defense information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals. Where unauthorized disclosure of information might have a
serious adverse effect on legal defense, there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an
unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal proceeding may be jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial
may be declared). The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and
disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government
complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal
process may result.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness,
or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact will be high. Also,
where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g.,
release of a terrorist or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given legal consequences of unauthorized disclosure,
the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for legal defense information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Legal defense
activities are not typically time-critical. In most cases, unauthorized modification or destruction
of legal defense information will have only a limited adverse effect on government operations,
government assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: For legal defense information, when
evidence or other defense information has been compromised the legal proceedings can be
jeopardized. As a consequence, the cost to the government and other entities in terms of finance,
time, and disruption to normal operations may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning
government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies
or the legal process may result. In this case, the integrity impact level will be moderate.

When the modification or destruction of legal defense information endangers public safety (e.g.,
release of a terrorist or other murderer), the integrity impact will be high. Even if public safety
is not endangered, the modification or destruction of legal defense information may result in
expensive and disruptive civil or criminal proceedings.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of unauthorized modification
or destruction and potential consequences for human life, the provisional integrity impact level
recommended for legal defense information is high.




                                                 206
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal defense information. Most legal
defense processes are tolerant of delay. Delays can impact court schedules, cause significant
taxpayer expense, and potentially jeopardize legal proceedings (see C17.2.2). In most cases,
disruption of access to legal defense information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., information
affecting a ruling regarding an impending execution), loss of availability of information can have
a severe adverse effect. The consequent availability impact level would be high.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The provisional availability impact
level recommended for legal defense information is low.

D.17.3 Legal Investigation Information Type

Legal investigation supports activities associated with gathering information about a given party
(government agency, citizen, corporation) that would be admissible in a court of law, in an
attempt to prove guilt or innocence. The recommended provisional categorization of the legal
investigation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather information about a given party
(government agency, citizen, corporation) that would be admissible in a court of law, in an
attempt to prove guilt or innocence.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of legal investigation information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime involved,
2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal31 to access the information and use it to commit a crime
or to evade detection or surveillance), and 3] on the capability criminal to injure witnesses or law
enforcement officials. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve
extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record of violence on the
part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate.

Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement
agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation
information will pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when
the disclosure concerns matters of multi-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff
agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be


31
     In this case, the term “criminal entity” includes both the criminal and legal representative(s) of the criminal (i.e.,
     council).


                                                             207
high. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular
concern.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given potentially serious to severe legal consequences
of unauthorized disclosure, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for legal
investigation information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of legal investigation information may
depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications associated with legal investigative organizations
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Where unauthorized modification or destruction of information has an adverse effect on the
granting/executing of a search or wiretap warrant or on the success of the subsequent
prosecution, a serious adverse effect on agency operations may result. This can place the agency
at a significant disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Legal investigation mission requirements
may include time-critical information. In such cases, major investigations can be jeopardized by
the unauthorized modification or destruction of legal investigation information. Where the
criminal case under investigation involves major property losses, large-scale financial frauds,
poses a threat to key national assets or human life, the integrity impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is high.

When legal investigation information addresses international matters, such as trade enforcement
or tariff agreements or when foreign nationals are involved, the integrity level is high. Any
deliberate or inadvertent corruption of such information could result in catastrophic adverse
effects on future operations, individual or agency reputations, and human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal investigation information.
Missions supported by legal investigation information are not typically tolerant of delay with
resultant serious consequences for ongoing investigations.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where the crimes involved pose a threat
to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level recommended
for legal investigation information is high.



                                                208
Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is moderate.

D.17.4 Legal Prosecution/Litigation Information Type

Legal prosecution/litigation includes all activities involved with presenting a case in a legal
proceeding both in a criminal or civil court of law in an attempt to prove guilt/responsibility. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the legal prosecution/litigation information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution/litigation information on the ability of responsible agencies to present a case in a
legal proceeding either in a criminal or civil court of law in an attempt to prove
guilt/responsibility. Dissemination of legal prosecution/litigation information is governed by
privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of Civil Procedure, and other laws
governing adversarial legal proceedings. While most information associated with legal
prosecution/litigation is public, some information is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected
from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law,
disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution/litigation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
assets, or individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime involved, 2] timing (e.g.,
the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to commit a crime or evade
detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability of the criminal to injure witnesses or law
enforcement officials.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized disclosure of
information might have a serious adverse effect on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a
presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal
proceeding is jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The cost to the government and
others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion
is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in
government agencies or the legal process may result. In this case, the confidentiality impact of
unauthorized disclosure will be moderate.

Where the life of a complainant, victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure,
the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice
are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the
confidentiality impact will be high.

Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement
agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution
information must be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets.
Additionally, when a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade


                                                    209
enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the
confidentiality impact will be high. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of
informants may be of particular concern.

[The impact of unauthorized disclosure of national security information is outside the scope of
this guideline.]

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the public nature of and disclosure rules
associated with most prosecution/litigation information, the provisional confidentiality impact
level recommended is low. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve
extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record of violence on the
part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Legal
prosecution/litigation activities are not typically time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications associated with legal
prosecution/litigation organizations (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be
limited. In general, the unauthorized modification or destruction of legal prosecution/litigation
information will have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, government
assets, or individuals. However, if evidence or other defense information has been
compromised, legal proceedings may be affected (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The
subsequent cost to the government in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations
may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious
loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal process may result.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or
informant may be endangered, the integrity impact will be high. Also, where the consequences
of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other
murderer), the integrity impact will be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of the unauthorized
modification or destruction of legal prosecution/litigation information, the provisional integrity
impact level recommended for legal prosecution/litigation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal prosecution/litigation
information. Most legal prosecution/litigation processes are tolerant of delay even though the
delays can impact court schedules, cause significant taxpayer expense, and potentially jeopardize
legal proceedings (see C17.4.2). Typically, the disruption of access to legal
prosecution/litigation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
government operations, agency assets, or individuals.



                                                  210
Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., information
affecting a ruling regarding an impending execution), loss of availability of information can have
a severe adverse effect. The availability impact level recommended for this legal
prosecution/litigation information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legal prosecution/litigation information is low.

D.17.5 Resolution Facilitation Information Type

Resolution facilitation involves all activities outside of a court of law that may be used in an
attempt to settle a dispute between two or more parties (government, citizen, corporation). The
general recommended security categorization for the resolution facilitation information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation
information on the ability of responsible entities to settle a dispute between two or more parties
(government, citizen, corporation) outside of a court of law. While some information associated
with resolution facilitation is public, much of the information is private and/or proprietary.
Unauthorized disclosure of such information can disrupt or defeat the dispute resolution process.
The consequences typically depend on the nature of the dispute. Jeopardy to the resolution
process will not usually involve threats to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human
life. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where large monetary amounts
and/or violent crimes are involved, the confidentiality impact of unauthorized disclosure of
resolution facilitation information is at least moderate.

In exceptional cases human lives may be jeopardized by failure of the resolution facilitation
process. Additionally, when resolution facilitation concerns matters of trans-national interest,
such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,
the confidentiality impact will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of unauthorized
disclosure, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for resolution facilitation
information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Resolution
facilitation activities are not typically time-critical. The modification or destruction of court
records may result in disruption or jeopardy of legal proceedings. In most cases, the adverse

effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of resolution facilitation information on
agency mission functions and/or public confidence in the agency can be expected to be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
resolution facilitation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to resolution facilitation information.
Most resolution facilitation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to
resolution facilitation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
resolution facilitation information is low.

D.18 Federal Correctional Activities
Correctional Activities involves all Federal activities that ensure the effective incarceration and
rehabilitation of convicted criminals.

D.18.1 Criminal Incarceration Information Type

Criminal incarceration includes activities associated with the housing, custody and general care
of criminals sentenced to serve time in penitentiaries. The following security categorization is
recommended for the criminal incarceration information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal incarceration
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide housing, custody, and general care
for criminals sentenced to serve time in a Federal penitentiary. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most criminal incarceration information are unlikely to have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations. The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve
exposure of information that is proprietary to prisoners that can result in damaging publicity for
an organization. (Unauthorized disclosure of some information can conceivably have serious
impact on the status or resolution of appeal actions). The consequences of unauthorized
disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most criminal incarceration information is normally low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The


                                                    212
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information
can be serious if the information is time-critical and results in the premature release of a
criminal, unjust retention of an individual in the prison system, or harm to a citizen’s reputation
or public confidence in the government.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., instructions regarding
a need to isolate a prisoner from the general prison population for personal safety reasons), the
unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information can result in loss
of human life a high impact potential.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal incarceration information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal incarceration information.
Criminal incarceration processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be cases (e.g. emergency
bulletins affecting prisoner health and/or safety) in which emergency dissemination of
information regarding life-threatening situations is delayed for excessive periods. Such cases
can result in a high availability impact level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal incarceration information is low.

D.18.2 Criminal Rehabilitation Information Type

Criminal Rehabilitation includes all government activities devoted to providing convicted
criminals with the educational resources and life skills necessary to rejoin society as responsible
and contributing members. The recommended provisional categorization of the criminal
rehabilitation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal rehabilitation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide convicted criminals with the
educational resources and life skills necessary to rejoin society as responsible and contributing
members. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal rehabilitation
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in criminal
rehabilitation systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 (The Privacy Act



                                                     213
Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type) or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for criminal rehabilitation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal rehabilitation information
would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most criminal rehabilitation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal rehabilitation information.
The effects of disruption of access to most criminal rehabilitation information or information
systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal rehabilitation information is low.

D.19 General Sciences and Innovation
General Science and Innovation includes all Federal activities to meet the national need to
advance knowledge in this area. This includes general research and technology programs, space
exploration activities, and other research and technology programs that have diverse goals and
cannot be readily classified into another mission area or information type.

D.19.1 Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation Information Type

Scientific Innovation includes all federal activities whose goal is the creation of new scientific
and/or technological knowledge as a goal in itself, without a specific link to the other mission
areas or information types identified in the OMB Business Reference Model. Most sensitive
information is developed under research and development programs that directly support another
of the mission areas described in this Appendix and are not included here. Some information
associated with scientific and technical research and innovation is national security information
and is outside the scope of this guideline. The recommended provisional categorization for the
scientific and technical research and innovation information type follows:


                                               214
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of scientific and
technical research and innovation information on the ability of responsible agencies to create
new scientific and/or technological knowledge as a goal in itself, without a specific link to other
program areas or information types. Many scientific and technical research and innovation
activities are conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings
resulting from those activities are intended for publication.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The pre-publication disclosure or
other unauthorized disclosure of information associated with competition for funding and
recognition (e.g., grants, development contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact level associated for scientific and technical research and innovation
information will be moderate.

In some cases, the information associated with scientific and technical research and innovation is

recommended for most scientific and technical research and innovation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most information associated with
scientific and technical research and innovation can be seriously disruptive to the progress of
research activities. The effects on future funding can be quite serious and can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to
the mission would usually be more limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
scientific and technical research and innovation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to scientific and technical research and
innovation information. Most research processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption
of access to research and innovation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.




                                                    215
Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
scientific and technical research and innovation information is low.

D.19.2 Space Exploration and Innovation Information Type

Space Exploration and Innovation includes all activities devoted to innovations directed at
human and robotic space flight and the development and operation of space launch and
transportation systems, and the general research and exploration of outer space. While some
space exploration and innovation is national security information, most sensitive information is
developed under research and development programs that directly support another of the mission
areas described in this Appendix and are not included here. The recommended provisional
categorization of the research and development information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of space exploration and
innovation information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities devoted to [1]
innovations directed at human and robotic space flight and the development and operation of
space launch and transportation systems, and [2] the general research and exploration of outer
space. Many space exploration and innovation activities are conducted with public institutions
of higher learning, and the findings resulting from those activities are intended for publication.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The pre-publication disclosure or
other unauthorized disclosure of information associated with competition for funding and
recognition (e.g., grants, development contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact associated with space exploration and innovation is moderate.

In some cases, the space exploration and innovation information is classified or otherwise
qualifies as national security information. This information is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most space exploration and innovation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most space exploration and
innovation information can be seriously disruptive to the progress of research activities. The
effects on future funding can be quite serious and can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
space exploration and innovation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to space exploration and innovation
information. Most research and innovation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases,
disruption of access to research and innovation information will have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
space exploration and innovation information is low.

D.20 Knowledge Creation and Management
Knowledge Creation and Management involves the programs and activities in which the Federal
Government creates or develops a body or set of knowledge, the manipulation and analysis of
which can provide inherent benefits for both the Federal and private sector.

D.20.1 Research and Development Information Type

Research and Development involves the gathering and analysis of data, dissemination of results,
and development of new products, methodologies, and ideas. The sensitivity and criticality of
most research and development information depends on the subject matter involved. The
recommended provisional categorization of the research and development information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level depends on the effect of unauthorized disclosure of research and
development information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather and analyze data,
disseminate results, and develop new products, methodologies, and ideas, and on the degree to
which unauthorized disclosure of the information can assist hostile institutions to do harm to the
interests of the government of the United States. Many research and development activities are
conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings resulting
from those activities are intended for publication. Unauthorized disclosure of most research and
development information can be expected to have only limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Most research and development
information is proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information violates several
statures and Federal regulations (see Appendix E). Pre-publication disclosure or other
unauthorized disclosure of research findings can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level
associated with research and development is moderate.


                                                    217
Premature and/or partial release of preliminary research and development information can lead to
misleading conclusions by policy makers, funding entities, news organizations, and/or the
general public. Where the research and development activities are associated with security
measures or law enforcement tools, potential adversaries may derive insights on countermeasures
development. In extreme cases, the resulting confidentiality impact can be high.

In some cases, the research and development information is classified or otherwise qualifies as
national security information). Such information is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most government research and development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most research and development
information can be seriously disruptive to the progress of research activities. The effects on
future funding can be serious and can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be more
limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
research and development information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to research and development information.
Most research and innovation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access
to research and innovation information will have only a limited adverse effect on government
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
research and development information is low.

D.20.2 General Purpose Data and Statistics Information Type

General purpose data and statistics includes activities performed in providing empirical,
numerical, and related data and information pertaining to the current state of the nation in areas
such as the economy, labor, weather, international trade, etc. The recommended provisional
categorization of the General Purpose Data and Statistics information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




                                                     218
Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general purpose data
and statistics information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide empirical, numerical,
and related data and information pertaining to the current state of the nation in areas such as the
economy, labor, weather, international trade, etc. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of most general-purpose data and statistics information would have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized premature disclosure
of much economic (e.g., agricultural commodity, economic indicators) data and statistics
information can result in major financial consequences. In some cases, premature disclosure of
this information can impact major financial markets and damage national banking and finance
infrastructures. Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major
commodity brokerage house), could damage faith in general-purpose data and statistics gathering
and development institutions, result in even more market disruption, and have a severe or
catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Even when the consequences are
limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial or commercial institution,
unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and
its staff. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most general-purpose data and statistics information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general-purpose data and statistics
information may depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general-purpose data and statistics information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general-purpose data and statistics
information. Missions supported by general-purpose data and statistics information are generally
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general-purpose data and statistics information is low.

D.20.3 Advising and Consulting Information Type

Advising and Consulting activities involve the guidance and consultative services provided by
the Federal Government to support the implementation of a specific service provided to citizens.
The recommended provisional categorization of the advising and consulting information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of advising and
consulting information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide guidance and
consultative services to support the implementation of a specific service to citizens. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of advising and consulting information depends on the
nature of the service being provided and on the sensitivity of the information with which
advisory or consulting entities are working. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
most advising and consulting information would have a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where consulting support involves
classified or other national security information, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
can be severe but are outside the scope of this guideline. In other cases, such as consultative
services provided to law enforcement institutions, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
can be serious or even life threatening. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for advising and consulting information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of advising and consulting information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
advising and consulting information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to advising and consulting information.
The effects of disruption of access to most advising and consulting information or information
systems would have limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
advising and consulting information is low.

D.20.4 Knowledge Dissemination Information Type

Knowledge Dissemination addresses those instances where the primary method used in
delivering a service is through the publishing or broadcasting of information, such as the Voice
of America or web-based museums maintained by the Smithsonian. Knowledge Dissemination is
not intended to address circumstances where the publication of information is a by-product of a
mission rather than the mission itself. The recommended provisional security categorization of
the knowledge dissemination information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of knowledge
dissemination information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish or broadcast
information. Premature and unauthorized disclosure of information being considered for
broadcast can be harmful if the information is subsequently determined to be false or
counterproductive to the knowledge dissemination mission. However, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most knowledge dissemination information would have, at most, a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
policies governing knowledge dissemination missions can be harmful to the agency mission
(e.g., some internal Voice of America editorial policies). This can result in assignment of a
moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for knowledge dissemination information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of knowledge dissemination
information may depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to
the mission would usually be limited. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of knowledge dissemination information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In cases of dissemination of
erroneous/defamatory information, an agency mission can be seriously harmed and the impact
level will be moderate.



                                                     221
Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
knowledge dissemination information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to knowledge dissemination information.
The effects of disruption of access to most knowledge dissemination information or information
systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: An exception is the extended disruption
of broadcast capabilities (e.g., Voice of America). Here, the agency mission is seriously harmed
and the impact of the consequences will be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most knowledge dissemination information is low.

D.21 Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement
Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement involves the direct monitoring and oversight of a
specific individual, group, industry, or community participating in a regulated activity via market
mechanisms, command and control features, or other means to control or govern conduct or
behavior.

D.21.1 Inspections and Auditing Information Type

Inspections and Auditing involves the methodical examination and review of regulated activities
to ensure compliance with standards for regulated activity. The recommended security
categorization for the inspections and auditing information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of inspections and
auditing information on the ability of responsible agencies to methodically examine and review
regulated activities to ensure compliance with standards for regulated activity. If the inspections
and auditing data belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the
confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is dependent on the nature of the regulated
activity.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
inspections and auditing information can alert personnel associated with programs being
monitored to the focus of inspection or auditing activities. With this information, program
personnel may divert attention from questionable program attributes or hide unfavorable
information. Where a major program or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on



                                                    222
unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information can pose a threat to human life
or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high.

National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Although there are many Federal environments in
which unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect, there are enough
circumstances in which serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals can result to justify recommendation of a moderate provisional confidentiality
impact level for inspections and auditing information.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of inspections and auditing
information can compromise the effectiveness of the program. The damage likely to be caused
by unauthorized modification or destruction may affect inspection or audit results with
subsequent serious adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency. The
consequences can be particularly serious if the destruction or modification of information
invalidates oversight of major programs or the information threatens human safety. The integrity
impact level depends on the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and on
the criticality of the processes being monitored (e.g., correctness of contract expenditure
reporting versus safety regulations affecting manned space flight).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Although there are regulatory environments in which a low
impact level is appropriate, the circumstances associated with most inspections and auditing
support information require at least a moderate provisional integrity impact level.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to inspections and auditing information.
In most cases, disruption of access to inspections and auditing information is expected to have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many
inspection or auditing operations involve activities for which temporary loss of availability is
likely to cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a significant
disadvantage, result in major damage to major assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: For most inspection and audit functions, the recommended
provisional availability impact level is low.

D.21.2 Standards Setting/Reporting Guideline Development Information Type

Standard Setting/Reporting Guideline Development involves the establishment of allowable
limits associated with a regulated activity and the development of reporting requirements
necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. This includes the


                                                223
development of requirements for product sampling and testing, emissions monitoring and
control, incident reporting, financial filings, etc. The following provisional security
categorization is recommended for the standards setting/reporting guideline development
information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of standards
setting/reporting guideline development information on the abilities of responsible agencies to
establish allowable limits associated with a regulated activity and to develop reporting
requirements necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. In a few cases,
the unauthorized public dissemination of standards or guidelines

information can harm the effectiveness of the function being supported (e.g., public
dissemination of Internal Revenue Service audit thresholds for certain deductions). However,
most Federal standards and guidelines are intended for public dissemination. The consequences
of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of standards setting/reporting guideline development
information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

There are some cases for which standards or guidelines include classified or other national
security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for standards setting/reporting guideline development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of standards setting/reporting
guideline development information depends primarily on the criticality of the information with
respect to agency mission capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. In
general, the effects of modifications or deletions of standards setting/reporting guideline
development information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
standards setting/reporting guideline development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to standards setting/reporting guideline
development information. The nature of standards setting/reporting guideline development
processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
standards setting/reporting guideline development information is low.

D.21.3 Permits and Licensing Information Type

Permits and Licensing involves activities associated with granting, revoking, and the overall
management of the documented authority necessary to perform a regulated task or function. The
following security categorization is recommended for the permits and licensing information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of permits and licensing
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to manage the documented authority
necessary to perform a regulated task or function. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of the majority of permits and licensing information will result in a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will typically be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or other laws and executive orders
affecting the dissemination of information regarding individuals. The Privacy Act Information
provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
information type. In such cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of permits and
licensing information could be serious. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level might be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most permits and licensing information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of permits and licensing information
depends primarily on the criticality of the regulated activity with respect to protection of
government assets, and safety of individuals. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion of
permits and licensing information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
permits and licensing information is low.

D.22 Public Goods Creation and Management
The construction, manufacturing, administration, and/or management of goods, structures,
facilities, common resources, etc. used for the general well being of the American public or
society at large.

D.22.1 Manufacturing Information Type

Manufacturing involves all programs and activities in which the Federal Government produces
both marketable and non-marketable goods. The following provisional security categorization is
recommended for the manufacturing information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of manufacturing
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to produce both marketable and non-
marketable goods. In a few cases, unauthorized disclosure of details of the products or
manufacturing processes can give adversaries opportunities (e.g., terrorism, industrial
espionage). However, in most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
manufacturing information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

There are some cases for which manufacturing or product information includes classified or
other national security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for manufacturing information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of manufacturing information depends
primarily on the criticality of the information with respect to a manufacturing process and on the
volume and use of the end product. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion of
manufacturing information are generally limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
manufacturing information is low.




                                                     226
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to manufacturing information. The nature
of most government manufacturing processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
manufacturing information is low.

D.22.2 Construction Information Type

Construction involves all programs and activities in which the Federal Government builds or
constructs facilities, roads, dams, etc. The following security categorization is recommended for
the construction information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of construction
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to build or construct facilities, roads, dams,
etc. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of construction information will
result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, construction details
can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate or destroy government
installations. Unauthorized disclosure of some construction details (e.g., alarm designs, points of
vulnerability to the to the structural integrity of a dam or building) can result in danger to critical
infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. In such cases, the confidentiality impact may
be high.

There are some cases for which construction information includes classified or other national
security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for construction information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of construction information depends
primarily on the criticality of the information. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion
of construction information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

construction information is low.




                                                     227
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to construction information. The nature of
most government construction processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
construction information is low.

D.22.3 Public Resources, Facilities and Infrastructure Management Information Type

Public Resources, Facilities and Infrastructure Management involves the management and
maintenance of government-owned capital goods and resources (natural or otherwise) on behalf
of the public, usually with benefits to the community at large as well as to the direct user.
Examples of facilities and infrastructure include schools, roads, bridges, dams, harbors, and
public buildings. Examples of resources include parks, cultural artifacts and art, endangered
species, oil reserves, etc. The following security categorization is recommended for the public
resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public resources,
facilities, and infrastructure management information on the abilities of responsible agencies to
manage and maintain government-owned capital goods and resources (natural or otherwise) on
behalf of the public, usually with benefits to the community at large as well as to the direct user.
In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of public resources, facilities, and
infrastructure management information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, premature
unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to
a commercial interest (e.g., proposed changes for management of petroleum reserves). The
confidentiality impact of consequent loss of public confidence and/or serious economic
disruption might be moderate.

In other cases, public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management details can be of use to
terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate the security of government property or to harm
populations. Unauthorized disclosure of some public resources, facilities, and infrastructure
management details to criminals (e.g., facilities security dispositions, building alarm designs),
can result in danger to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact can be high

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is
low.




                                                     228
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of public resources, facilities, and
infrastructure management information depends primarily on the criticality of the information
with respect to management of public resources, facilities, and infrastructures. Typically, the
effects of modification or deletion of public resources, facilities, and infrastructure information
are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to public resources, facilities, and
infrastructure management information. The nature of most government public resources,
facilities, and infrastructure management processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is low.

D.22.4 Information Infrastructure Management Information Type

Information Infrastructure Management involves the management and stewardship of a type of
information by the Federal Government and/or the creation of physical communication
infrastructures on behalf of the public in order to facilitate communication. This includes the
management of large amounts of information (e.g., environmental and weather data, criminal
records, etc.), the creation of information and data standards relating to a specific type of
information (patient records), and the creation and management of physical communication
infrastructures (networks) on behalf of the public.

Note: Information infrastructures for government use are not included in this information type
because the impact levels associated with information infrastructure maintenance information are
primarily a function of the information processed in that infrastructure. The recommended
provisional security categorization for the information infrastructure maintenance information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of information
infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage a type of
information and/or to create physical communication infrastructures on behalf of the public in
order to facilitate communication. The disclosure of most information infrastructure maintenance
information can be expected to result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.


                                                     229
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, information
infrastructure maintenance details can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to
destroy government data bases or communications infrastructures, or deny access to information
needed by the public. Unauthorized disclosure of some information infrastructure maintenance
details to criminals can result in danger to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human
life. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be high. In other cases, premature
unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to
a commercial interest (e.g., proposed outsourcing of system administration or details of a
proposes communications system acquisition). This can result in assignment of a moderate
impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for information infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. That is, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure
maintenance information typically depend on the criticality of the data processed by the
infrastructure and whether this data is time-critical. In most cases, the data will not be urgently
needed or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In a relatively few cases, the consequences
of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance
information might result in serious damage to agency operations, assets, or human safety. This
may require a moderate or high integrity impact level for information infrastructure maintenance
information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
information infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to information infrastructure maintenance
information. Disruption of access to information infrastructure maintenance information or
information systems will typically result in denial of access to resources for all affected agencies.
Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including
mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or other time critical functions (e.g., some systems that
support air traffic control functions). The availability impact level associated with unauthorized
modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information needed to
respond to emergencies or critical to public safety may be high.



                                                230
Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
information infrastructure maintenance information is low.

D.23 Federal Financial Assistance
Federal Financial Assistance is the provision of earned and unearned financial or monetary-like
benefits to individuals, groups, or corporations.

D.23.1 Federal Grants (Non-State) Information Type

Federal Grants involve the disbursement of funds by the Federal Government to a non-Federal
entity to help fund projects or activities. This includes the processes associated with grant
administration, including the publication of funds availability notices, development of the grant
application guidance, determination of grantee eligibility, coordination of the peer
review/evaluation process for competitive grants, the transfer of funds, and the
monitoring/oversight as appropriate. The recommended provisional security categorization for
the federal grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of federal grants
information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse funds to non-Federal entities to
fund projects or activities. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of federal grants information will
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, records associated
with grants may include information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of
1974). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type. In many cases, premature and unauthorized
disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving an unfair competitive advantage
to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence
can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agency’s operations and mission. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

In some cases, federal grants information might be moderate to high impact. Also, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be sensitive (e.g., research grants for weapons
systems project activities). Some federal grants information and some grant program details may
be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for federal grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Federal grants


                                                     231
activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations are
usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies may be necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of federal grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency is limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
federal grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to federal grants information. Federal
grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to federal
grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
federal grants information is low.

D.23.2 Direct Transfers to Individuals Information Type

Direct Transfers to Individuals involves the disbursement of funds from the Federal Government
directly to beneficiaries (individuals or organizations) who satisfy Federal eligibility
requirements with no restrictions imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. Direct
Transfers include both earned and unearned Federal Entitlement programs such as Medicare,
Social Security, unemployment benefits, etc. The recommended provisional security
categorization for the direct transfers to individuals information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to
individuals information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse funds from the Federal
Government directly to beneficiaries (individuals or organizations) who satisfy Federal eligibility
requirements with no restrictions imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. In the
majority of cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to individuals will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.




                                                     232
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Many of the records associated with
the disbursements may include information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act
of 1974, HIPAA of 1996). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In such cases,
punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on
an agency’s operations and mission. The consequent confidentiality impact level could be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for direct transfers to individuals is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Federal
disbursement activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the monetary amounts
involved are not large (on a governmental budgetary scale). Also, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of direct transfers to individuals on agency mission
functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
direct transfers to individuals is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to direct transfers to individuals
information. Federal disbursement processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases,
disruption of access to information regarding direct transfers to individuals can be expected to
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Disruption of disbursements to large
populations can do serious harm to public confidence in the agency and have a harmful impact
on the nation’s economy (e.g., affect consumer confidents and retail sales for a month or
quarter). In such cases, the availability impact would be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
direct transfers to individuals is low.




                                                 233
D.23.3 Subsidies Information Type

Subsidies involve Federal Government financial transfers that reduce costs and/or increase
revenues of producers. Subsidies include the payment of funds from the government to affect the
production or prices of various goods to benefit the public. The recommended provisional
security categorization for the subsidies information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of subsidies information
on the ability of responsible agencies to pay government funds to affect the production or prices
of various goods to benefit the public benefit. In many cases, unauthorized disclosure of
subsidies information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with
applications for subsidies includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of
1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type.) Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of
information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious effect on public
confidence in the agency. Also, premature unauthorized disclosure of planned subsidies policies
can affect financial/commodities markets, with associated potential adverse effects on the U.S.
economy and serious adverse effects on public confidence in the agency. This can result in
assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most subsidies information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Subsidies
activities are not typically time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of subsidies information on agency mission functions, image or
public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
subsidies information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to subsidies information. Subsidies
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to subsidies
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

subsidies information is low.

D.23.4 Tax Credits Information Type

Tax Credits allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which
provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability designed to
encourage certain kinds of activities or to aid taxpayers in special circumstances. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the tax credits information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of tax credit information
on the ability of responsible agencies to allow special exclusions, exemptions, or deductions
from gross income or which provide special credits, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax
liability designed to encourage certain kinds of activities or to aid taxpayers in special
circumstances. Many of the records associated with disbursements may include information
subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code and
Manual, or the Economic Espionage Act). (The provisional impact levels for personnel
information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, Representative
Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such cases, punitive consequences and/or
loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agency’s operations and
mission. In many cases, unauthorized disclosure of tax credit information can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended
for tax credit information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Tax credits are
not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or

D.24 Credit and Insurance
Credit and Insurance involves the use of government funds to cover the subsidy cost of a direct
loan or loan guarantee or to protect/indemnify members of the public from financial losses.

D.24.1 Direct Loans Information Type

Direct loans involve a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower
under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the direct loan information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct loan
information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds to non-Federal
borrowers under contract terms that require the repayment of such funds with or without interest.
Much direct loan information includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act
of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type.) In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct
loan information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of large
volumes of information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to
severe effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for direct loan information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan assistance
activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of direct loan information on agency mission functions and public

D.24.2 Loan Guarantees Information Type

Loan guarantees involve any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of
all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a
non-Federal lender, but does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable
accounts in financial institutions. The general recommended security categorization for the loan
guarantees information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of loan guarantee
information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute guarantees, insurance, or other
pledges with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt
obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal lender. In most cases, unauthorized
disclosure of loan guarantee information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Much loan guarantee information
includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act
Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type.) Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information
protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public
confidence in the agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be moderate.

information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The provisional availability impact
level recommended for loan guarantee information is low.

D.24.3 General Insurance Information Type

General Insurance involves providing protection to individuals or entities against specified
risks. The specified protection generally involves risks that private sector entities are unable
or unwilling to assume or subsidize and where the provision of insurance is necessary to
achieve social objectives. The following provisional security categorization is recommended
for the general insurance information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general insurance
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to provide protection to individuals or
entities against specified risks. General insurance activities include both insurance issuing and
insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any activity such as provider approval, underwriting,
and endorsements. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing
information will generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing insurance
include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation, claims management, and
retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
insurance servicing information on the abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process
insurance. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information will
generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.



                                                     238
Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The more serious consequences may
result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider’s proprietary information, or 2) premature
disclosure of agency plans or changes under consideration for contracts, plans, or policies.
Unauthorized disclosure of information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of
the interests of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated
termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public expense and
exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an individual private sector
organization, unfair competitive advantage may result – with major financial consequences. In
the case of unauthorized disclosure of preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect
and pessimistic (e.g., Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the
public may have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the
more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.

The more serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information
may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the insured (e.g.,
Privacy Act information). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In the more serious
cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for general insurance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general insurance information may
depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) typically has a limited adverse effect on agency operations and/or public
confidence in the agency.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general insurance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general insurance information. The
nature of general insurance processes is usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Extensive delays in insurance servicing
activities can result in financial harm for individuals and businesses and in public alarm and
repercussions in the financial markets. In more serious cases, delays may have serious political
and operational consequences for affected agencies. In such cases, the confidentiality impact
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general insurance information is low.

D.25 Transfers to State/Local Governments
Transfers to States and Local Governments involve the transfer of funds or financial assistance
from the Federal government to State and Local governments and Indian tribes.

D.25.1 Formula Grants Information Type

Formula Grants involves the allocation of money to States or their subdivisions in accordance
with distribution formulas prescribed by law or administrative regulation, for activities of a
continuing nature. The recommended provisional security categorization for the formula grants
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of formula grants
information on the ability of responsible agencies to allocate money to States or their
subdivisions in accordance with distribution formulas prescribed by law or administrative
regulation, for activities of a continuing nature. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most
formula grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
or individuals. In most cases, information associated with formula grants is public knowledge.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of programs
for which formula grants are awarded may be sensitive (e.g., some Federal/State cooperative
programs intended to support Homeland Security operations). This can result in assignment of a
moderate or high impact level to such information.          Some formula grants information might
be classified (hence outside the scope of this guideline).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for formula grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Formula grants
activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations are
usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies is probably necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of formula grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
formula grants information is low.



                                                     240
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to formula grants information. Formula
grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to formula
grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
formula grants information is low.

D.25.2 Project/Competitive Grants Information Type

Project/Competitive Grants involves the funding, for fixed or known periods, of projects.
Project/Competitive grants can include fellowships, scholarships, research grants, training grants,
traineeships, experimental and demonstration grants, evaluation grants, planning grants,
technical assistance grants, survey grants, and construction grants. The general recommended
security categorization for the project/competitive grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of project/competitive
grants information on the ability of responsible agencies to award fellowships, scholarships,
research grants, training grants, traineeships, experimental and demonstration grants, evaluation
grants, planning grants, technical assistance grants, survey grants, and/or construction grants. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of project/competitive grants information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, project/competitive
grants information may be sensitive with moderate to high impact. In a few cases, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.

In a few cases, records associated with the grants may include information subject to privacy
restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In many
cases, premature and unauthorized disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving
an unfair competitive advantage to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences
and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agency’s operations
and mission. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most project/competitive grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.


                                                     241
Project/competitive grants activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of project/competitive grants information on
agency mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
project/competitive grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to project/competitive grants information.
Project/competitive grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of
access to project/competitive grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
project/competitive grants information is low.

D.25.3 Earmarked Grants Information Type

Earmarked Grants involves the distribution of money to State and Local Governments for a
named purpose or service usually specifically noted by Congress in appropriations language, or
other program authorizing language. The recommended provisional security categorization for
the earmarked grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of earmarked grants
information on the ability of responsible Federal government entities to distribute money to State
and Local Governments for a named purpose or service usually

specifically noted by Congress in appropriations language, or other program authorizing
language. In the majority of cases, earmarked grants information is public knowledge.
Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most earmarked grants information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, project/competitive
grants information may be sensitive with moderate to high impact. In a few cases, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for earmarked grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Earmarked


                                                     242
grants activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations
are usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies is probably necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of earmarked grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
earmarked grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to earmarked grants information.
Earmarked grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of
access to earmarked grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
earmarked grants information is low.

D.25.4 State Loans Information Type

State Loans involve all disbursement of funds by the Government to a State or Local
Government (or Indian Tribe) entity under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds
with or without interest. The recommended provisional security categorization for the state loan
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of state loan information
on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds a State or Local Government (or
Indian Tribe) entity under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without
interest. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of state loan information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for state loan information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan assistance
activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of state loan information on agency mission functions and public
confidence in the agency will be limited.




                                                     243
Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
state loan information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to state loan information. Loan assistance
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to state loan
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
state loan information is low.

APPENDIX E: LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE SOURCES ESTABLISHING
    SENSITIVITY/CRITICALITY

Some information has been established in law, by Executive Order, or by agency regulation as
requiring protection from disclosure. Those information types that are national security
information are outside the scope of this guideline. Each individual responsible for security
categorization of an organization’s information or information system should search his own
department or agency’s regulations for specific information protection requirements.

E.1 Legislative Mandates
Some legislatively mandated prohibitions against disclosure of information (other than national
security information) are identified in Table 6. The table gives the title or subject of the section
in the United States Code (U.S.C.) in which the prohibition occurs, the U.S.C. citation for the
prohibition, and the Department, agency, or generic information type to which the law applies,
and the legal source. Note that the information contained in the table is intended only as an aid
and will not always be current. Independent law searches by analysts will generally be
necessary.

    [See text at http://csrc.nist.gov/policies/privacypol.pdf.]

       Federal agencies must protect an individual's right to privacy when they collect personal
       information. This is required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and OMB Circular No.
       A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources," 61 Fed. Reg. 6428 (Feb. 20,
       1996), and supported by the Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information
       published by the Information Infrastructure Task Force on June 6, 1995. Posting a
       privacy policy helps ensure that individuals have notice and choice about, and thus
       confidence in, how their personal information is handled when they use the Internet.

       of a central Federal information security incident center consistent with the requirements
       of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002.

       (24) All Federal department and agency heads are responsible for the identification,
       prioritization, assessment, remediation, and protection of their respective internal critical
       infrastructure and key resources. Consistent with the Federal Information Security
       Management Act of 2002, agencies will identify and provide information security
       protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the
       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of
       information.

       III. Sensitive But Unclassified Information

       In addition to information that could reasonably be expected to assist in the development
       or use of weapons of mass destruction, which should be classified or reclassified as
       described in Parts I and II above, departments and agencies maintain and control sensitive
       information related to America's homeland security that might not meet one or more of
       the standards for classification set forth in Part 1 of Executive Order 12958. The need to
       protect such sensitive information from inappropriate disclosure should be carefully
       considered, on a case-by-case basis, together with the benefits that result from the open
       and efficient exchange of scientific, technical, and like information.

       All departments and agencies should ensure that in taking necessary and appropriate
       actions to safeguard sensitive but unclassified information related to America's homeland
       security, they process any Freedom of Information Act request for records containing
       such information in accordance with the Attorney General's FOIA Memorandum of
       October 12, 2001, by giving full and careful consideration to all applicable FOIA
       exemptions. See FOIA Post, "New Attorney General FOIA Memorandum Issued"
       (posted 10/15/01) (found at http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiapost/2001foiapost19.htm),
       which discusses and provides electronic links to further guidance on the authority
       available under Exemption 2 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(2), for the protection of
       sensitive critical infrastructure information. In the case of information that is voluntarily
       submitted to the Government from the private sector, such information may readily fall
       within the protection of Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).

E.3 OMB and Case Law Interpretations
The disclosure prohibitions, as stated in law are often imprecise. As a result, Office of
Management and Budget and case law interpretations are sometimes necessary to clarify the
prohibitions. In some cases, the analyst may need to identify such clarifications and
interpretations.

One law imposing disclosure prohibitions that has received particular attention across the Federal
government deserves special attention. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (2000), which
has been in effect since September 27, 1975, can generally be characterized as an omnibus "code
of fair information practices" that attempts to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and
dissemination of personal information by federal executive branch agencies. However, the Act's
imprecise language, limited legislative history, and somewhat outdated regulatory guidelines
have rendered it a difficult statute to decipher and apply. Moreover, even after more than twenty-
five years of administrative and judicial analysis, numerous Privacy Act issues remain
unresolved or unexplored. Adding to these interpretational difficulties is the fact that many
Privacy Act cases are unpublished district court decisions.

A primary element of the Privacy Act of 1974 is the “no disclosure without consent” rule: No
agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of


                                                293
communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or
with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12
exceptions]." 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b).

Note that a "disclosure" can be by any means of communication - written, oral, electronic, or
mechanical. [See OMB Guidelines, 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948, 28,953 (1975).]
Details of the Privacy Act of 1974, together with OMB and judicial interpretations can be found
on the Department of Justice web site, http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/04_7_1.html.

Subsection (v) of the Privacy Act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1)
"prescribe guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in implementing" the Act; and (2)
"provide continuing assistance to and oversight of the implementation" of the Act by agencies. 5
U.S.C. § 552a(v). The vast majority of OMB's Privacy Act Guidelines (OMB Guidelines) are
published at 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948-78 (1975). However, these original guidelines have been
supplemented in particular subject areas over the years. 40 Fed. Reg. 56,741-43 (1975) (system
of records definition, routine use and intra-agency disclosures, consent and congressional
inquiries, accounting of disclosures, amendment appeals, rights of parents and legal guardians,
relationship to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)); 48 Fed. Reg. 15,556-60 (1983)
(relationship to Debt Collection Act); 52 Fed. Reg. 12,990-93 (1987) ("call detail" programs); 54
Fed. Reg. 25818-29 (1989) (computer matching); 56 Fed. Reg. 18,599-601 (proposed Apr. 23,
1991) (computer matching); 61 Fed. Reg. 6428, 6435-39 (1996) ("Federal Agency
Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals").

As a general rule, the OMB Guidelines are entitled to the deference usually accorded the
interpretations of the agency that has been charged with the administration of a statute. Quinn v.
Stone, 978 F.2d 126, 133 (3d Cir. 1992); Baker v. Dep't of the Navy, 814 F.2d 1381, 1383 (9th
Cir. 1987); Perry v. FBI, 759 F.2d 1271, 1276 n.7 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing Bartel v. FAA, 725 F.2d
1403, 1408 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1984); Albright v. United States, 631 F.2d 915, 919 n.5 (D.C. Cir.
1980)), rev'd en banc on other grounds, 781 F.2d 1294 (7th Cir. 1986); Smiertka v. United States
Dep't of the Treasury, 604 F.2d 698, 703 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Rogers v. United States Dep't of
Labor, 607 F. Supp. 697, 700 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 1985); Sanchez v. United States, 3 Gov't Disclosure
Serv. (P-H) ¶ 83,116, at 83,709 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 1982); Golliher v. United States Postal
Serv., 3 Gov't Disclosure Serv. (P-H) ¶ 83,114, at 83,703 (N.D. Ohio June 10, 1982); Greene v.
VA, No. C-76-461-S, slip op. at 6-7 (M.D.N.C. July 3, 1978); Daniels v. FCC, No. 77-5011, slip
op. at 8-9 (D.S.D. Mar. 15, 1978); see also Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, 819 F.2d 1181,
1188 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (OMB interpretation is "worthy of our attention and solicitude").
However, a few courts have rejected particular aspects of the OMB Guidelines as inconsistent
with the statute. Kassel v. VA, No. 87-217-S, slip op. at 24-25 (D.N.H. Mar. 30, 1992)
(subsection (e)(3)); Saunders v. Schweiker, 508 F. Supp. 305, 309 (W.D.N.Y. 1981) (same);
Metadure Corp. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 1368, 1373-74 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (subsection
(a)(2)); Fla. Med. Ass'n v. HEW, 479 F. Supp. 1291, 1307-11 (M.D. Fla. 1979) (same); Zeller v.
United States, 467 F. Supp. 487, 497-99 (E.D.N.Y. 1979) (same).

Additionally, OMB has issued guidance regarding implementation of the privacy provisions of
the E-Government Act of 2002 (See Section 208 of Public Law 107-347, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 36).
Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires that OMB issue guidance to agencies on



                                               294
implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act. M-03-22, the September 26,
2003 Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, OMB Guidance for
Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, complies with this
requirement (see http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/m03-22.html). M-03-22 also
provides a general outline of regulatory requirements pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (“COPPA”) and a summary of modifications to existing guidance. A complete list
of OMB privacy guidance currently in effect is available at OMB’s website.
