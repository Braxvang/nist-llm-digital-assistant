NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution would be appreciated by
NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

Executive Summary

Traditionally, information technology (IT) security and capital planning and investment control (CPIC)
processes have been performed independently by security and capital planning practitioners. However,
the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and other existing federal
regulations charge agencies with integrating the two activities. In addition, with increased competition
for limited federal budgets and resources, agencies must ensure that available funding is applied towards
the agencies’ highest priority IT security investments. Applying funding towards high-priority security
investments supports the objective of maintaining appropriate security controls, both at the enterprise-
wide and system level, commensurate with levels of risk and data sensitivity. This special publication
(SP) introduces common criteria against which agencies can prioritize security activities to ensure that
corrective actions identified in the annual FISMA reporting process are incorporated into the capital
planning process to deliver maximum security in a cost-effective manner.

The implementation of IT security and capital planning practices within the federal government is driven
by a combination of legislation, rules and regulations, and agency-specific policies. FISMA requires
agencies to integrate IT security into their capital planning and enterprise architecture processes, conduct
annual IT security reviews of all programs and systems, and report the results of those reviews to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Therefore, the implementation of FISMA legislation
effectively integrates IT security and capital planning because agencies must document resource and
funding plans for IT security. Furthermore, implementation of FISMA legislation is intended to ensure
that agency resources are protected and risk is effectively managed. It requires that agencies incorporate
IT security into the life cycle of their information systems. OMB’s FISMA reporting guidance also
referenced use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-26, Security Self-
Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems to evaluate agency security programs. The results
of the self-assessment should be documented in the agency’s annual FISMA report and logged in the
agency’s plan of action and milestones (POA&M), along with POA&M inputs from other appropriate
sources. The agency must then determine the costs and timeframes associated with mitigating the
weaknesses identified in the POA&Ms. These costs are captured in the system or program’s annual OMB
Exhibit 300 and in the enterprise-wide Exhibit 53, which are the funding vehicles submitted to OMB to
secure an operating budget. Figure ES-1 illustrates this process.

The investment life cycle employed by agencies for IT investments is based on the Government
Accountability Office’s (GAO) Select, Control, and Evaluate framework. This investment management
framework ensures that investment management practices, including IT security, are disciplined and
thorough throughout the investment’s life cycle.

To address the capital planning and IT security requirements imposed on federal IT investments, NIST
recommends a seven-step framework (see Figure ES-2) for integrating IT security into the capital
planning process for enterprise-level IT security activities and individual system IT security activities:

            Enterprise-level investments – those security investments that are ubiquitous across the agency
            and will improve the overall agency’s security posture. [For example, an enterprise-wide firewall
            or intrusion detection system (IDS) acquisition or public key infrastructure (PKI).]

            System-level investments – those security investments designed to strengthen a discrete system’s
            security posture. (For example, strengthening password controls or testing a contingency plan for
            a particular system.)

The framework assists federal agencies in integrating IT security into the capital planning process by
providing a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating IT security investments. The
methodology relies on existing data inputs (for example, NIST SP 800-26 self-assessment, certification
and accreditation information, and audit reports) so it can be readily implemented at federal agencies.
Inputs for the methodology include:

            Enterprise-Level Information
             o Stakeholder rankings of enterprise-wide initiatives
             o Enterprise-wide initiative IT security status
             o Cost of implementing remaining appropriate security controls for enterprise-wide initiatives
            System-Level Information
              o System categorization1
              o Security compliance
              o Corrective action cost

Based on the above information, the seven-step methodology,
shown in Figure ES-2, can help agencies identify high-priority
corrective actions for immediate funding. The seven steps include:

    1. Identify the Baseline: use information security metrics or
       other available data to baseline the current security
       posture.
    2. Identify Prioritization Requirements: evaluate security
       posture against legislative and Chief Information Officer
       (CIO)-articulated requirements and agency mission.
    3. Conduct Enterprise-Level Prioritization: prioritize
       potential enterprise-level IT security investments against
       mission and financial impact of implementing appropriate
       security controls.
    4. Conduct System-Level Prioritization: prioritize
       potential system-level corrective actions against system
       category and corrective action impact.
    5. Develop Supporting Materials: for enterprise-level
       investments, develop concept paper, business case
       analysis, and Exhibit 300. For system-level investments,
       adjust Exhibit 300 to request additional funding to
       mitigate prioritized weaknesses.
                                                                          Figure ES-2. Integrating IT
    6. Implement Investment Review Board (IRB) and                       Security and Capital Planning
       Portfolio Management: prioritize agency-wide business
       cases against requirements and CIO priorities and
       determine investment portfolio.
    7. Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management: ensure approved 300s
       become part of the agency’s Exhibit 53; ensure investments are managed through their life cycle
       (using Earned Value Management for Development/Modernization/Enhancement investments
       and operational assessments for steady state investments) and through the GAO’s Information
       Technology Investment Management (ITIM) maturity framework.

The process presented in this guidance is intended to serve as a model methodology. Agencies should
work within their investment planning environments to adapt and incorporate the pieces of this process
into their own unique processes to develop workable approaches for CPIC. If incorporated into an
agency’s processes, the methodology can help ensure that IT security is appropriately planned for and
funded throughout the investment’s life cycle, thus strengthening the agency’s overall security posture.

security and capital planning practitioners. However, with FISMA
legislation and existing federal regulations that charge agencies with integrating the two activities and
with increased competition for limited federal budgets, agencies must effectively integrate their IT
security and capital planning processes. This guidance introduces common criteria against which agencies
can prioritize security activities and ensure that corrective actions identified during the FISMA reporting
process are incorporated into the capital planning process to deliver maximum security and financial
benefit to the agency.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) first explored this topic in its 2002–2003
Return on Security Investment (ROSI) study. During this effort, NIST interviewed Chief Information
Officers (CIO), Chief Financial Officers (CFO), and Chief Technology Officers of federal agencies and
private sector companies to generate a common body of knowledge and to identify best practices in
returns on IT security investments in both the public and private sectors.

NIST used the information collected through the ROSI study as the foundation for a workshop on
integrating security and capital planning efforts. On June 4, 2003, and June 30, 2003, NIST presented a
workshop entitled Integrating IT Security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control Process.
Over 200 members of the federal community attended the two workshops, where they learned how to
prioritize security investments to ensure that the most cost-effective, highest impact investments would
receive funding. This document captures and expands upon the proceedings of the two workshops,
including the prioritization process.

1.2   Relationship to Existing Guidance

This document is a continuation in a series of NIST special publications (SP) intended to assist IT
security personnel in planning and prioritizing their IT security investments. This document illustrates a
prioritization approach that uses the 17 topic areas found in NIST SP 800-26, Security Self-Assessment
Guide for Information Technology Systems, as investment prioritization criteria for multiple types of
investments, including plan of actions and milestones (POA&M) corrective actions. While other criteria
may be substituted for these topic areas (for example, recommended security controls from NIST SP
800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems), using NIST SP 800-26 was
deemed favorable because it enables agencies to reuse data and information they have already gathered to
support FISMA reporting, thus substantially reducing the need for additional data collection. Figure 1-1
illustrates the relationship between NIST SP 800-65 and other NIST guidance.

provided in NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, can be used as




                 Figure 1-1. NIST Special Publications and the Prioritization Process
a source for baselining an agency’s IT security posture, and NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems, can be used to identify vulnerabilities before completing an OMB
Exhibit 300.

NIST SP 800-30 provides definitions and practical guidance necessary for assessing and mitigating
security risks identified within IT systems.2 NIST 800-55 provides an approach for identifying,
formulating, and implementing metrics to assess the level of security policies and procedures
implementation, gauge efficiency and effectiveness of security measures, and determine the impact of
such measures on the organization’s mission and business. NIST 800-26 provides a vehicle for an
internal assessment of the controls in place for an application or a general support system.3 All three
pieces of guidance define a set of activities, the results of which provide inputs into the POA&M, and are
then prioritized to ensure the most pressing security needs are addressed first. It should be noted that
results of other activities, such as weaknesses identified by Government Accountability Office (GAO) and
Inspector General (IG) audits, should also be documented in the POA&M. Exhibit 300s that include
funding for prioritized corrective actions and other costs of security are developed and submitted to OMB
to secure funding either as stand-alone investment requests or as the security component of an IT
investment proposal. The benefits of this approach are the traceability across each step and the ability to
reuse collected data. In addition, the benefits enable seamless risk management as corrective actions
identified through risk assessments, self-assessments, and metrics data collections are documented and
used in OMB funding requests.

This document contains several references to OMB guidance, including OMB Circular A-11. This OMB
guidance intends to provide notional strategies for providing security inputs to the capital planning
process. This guidance does not supersede Circular A-11; rather, it provides additional information
to assist agencies with successfully integrating security into their capital planning processes.

1.3     Purpose and Scope

This document can be used to assist federal agencies in integrating IT security into their CPIC processes
by providing a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating IT security investments. This
approach will support alignment with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)4and will provide a

  The FEA is a collection of interrelated "reference models" designed to facilitate cross-agency analysis and identify duplicative
   investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across federal agencies.
                                                                 2
balanced process to support prudent portfolio management. Specifically, the systematic approach can
help agencies:

       Identify relevant OMB and other guidance that applies to governing federal government IT
       security investment decisions
       Explain how current security requirements relate and support the IT CPIC process
       Understand the IT investment management process phases—Select, Control, and Evaluate—as
       they relate to security investments
       Identify CPIC-related roles and responsibilities required to manage IT security investments
       Explain the best practices IT security management process and why it is important for making
       sound IT security investment decisions
       Understand how to develop security requirements and appropriate supporting documentation for
       IT acquisition
       Identify steps and materials required to complete a sound business case in support of investment
       requests
       Understand implementation issues associated with incorporating IT security into the CPIC process.

The process identified in this document is not a rigid methodology to be followed meticulously by all
agencies; rather, it is a roadmap that serves to highlight key activities and practices that are essential to a
disciplined approach to security capital planning. The process shows the data required to link FISMA and
POA&M corrective actions to capital planning.

1.4   Security CPIC Process Overview

A mature CPIC process is essential for effective investment
management within any organization. Figure 1-2 presents a
model CPIC approach that integrates IT security
considerations.

The process is a roadmap that highlights key capital
planning activities. Key events within each step include:

       Identify the Baseline: use information security
       metrics or other available data to baseline the current
       security posture.

       Identify Prioritization Requirements: evaluate
       security posture against legislative and Chief
       Information Officer (CIO)-articulated requirements
       and agency mission.

       Conduct Enterprise-Level Prioritization: prioritize
       potential enterprise-level IT security investments
       against mission and financial impact of
       implementing appropriate security controls.
                                                                  Figure 1-2. Integrating IT Security
       Conduct System-Level Prioritization: prioritize                  and Capital Planning
       potential system-level corrective actions against
       system sensitivity and corrective action impact.



                                                       3
          Develop Supporting Materials: for enterprise-level investments, develop concept paper, business
          case analysis, and Exhibit 300. For system-level investments, adjust Exhibit 300 to request
          additional funding to mitigate prioritized weaknesses.

          Implement Investment Review Board (IRB) and Portfolio Management: prioritize agency-wide
          business cases against requirements and CIO priorities and determine investment portfolio.

          Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management: ensure approved 300s
          become part of the agency’s Exhibit 53; ensure investments are managed through their life cycle
          (using Earned Value Management for Development/Modernization/Enhancement investments and
          operational assessments for steady state investments) and through the GAO’s Information
          Technology Investment Management (ITIM) maturity framework.

The process presented in this document is intended to serve as a model methodology. Agencies should
work within their investment planning environments to adapt and incorporate the pieces of this process
into their own unique processes to develop workable approaches for integrating IT security into the CPIC
process.

A detailed description of a recommended CPIC process is provided in Section 4.

1.5       Definitions

Throughout this guidance document, references are made to key terms that are essential to understanding
the integration of IT security into the capital planning process. These terms are defined below.

          Security controls are the management, operational, and technical controls (e.g., safeguards or
          countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
          availability of the system and its information.5
          An IT security investment is an IT application, service or system that is solely devoted to security.
          For instance, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and public key infrastructure (PKI) are examples
          of IT security investments.
          Security risk versus investment risk are two distinctly different measures:
              o Security risk. The level of impact on agency operations (including mission, functions,
                image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an
                information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat
                occurring.6
              o Investment risk. Risks associated with the potential inability to achieve overall program
                objectives within defined cost, schedule, and technical constraints. OMB has defined 19
                areas of investment risk, all of which are required to be addressed in the Exhibit 300.

           Select-Control-Evaluate7 is an IT investment management process:
              o Select. The goal of the selection phase is to assess and prioritize current and proposed IT
                projects and then create a portfolio of IT projects. In doing so, this phase helps to ensure that
                the organization (1) selects those IT projects that will best support mission needs and (2)
                identifies and analyzes a project’s risks and returns before spending a significant amount of
                project funds. A critical element of this phase is that a group of senior executives makes
                project selection and prioritization decisions based on a consistent set of decision criteria
                that compares costs, benefits, risks, and potential returns of the various IT projects.
              o Control. The control phase consists of managing investments while monitoring for results.
                Once the IT projects have been selected, senior executives periodically assess the progress
                of the projects against their projected cost, scheduled milestones, and expected mission
                benefits.
              o Evaluate. The evaluation phase provides a mechanism for constantly improving the
                organization’s IT investment process. The goal of this phase is to measure, analyze, and
                record results based on the data collected throughout each phase. Senior executives assess
                the degree to which each project has met its planned cost and schedule goals and has
                fulfilled its projected contribution to the organization’s mission. The primary tool in this
                phase is the post-implementation review (PIR), which should be conducted once a project
                has been completed. PIRs help senior managers assess whether a project’s proposed benefits
                were achieved and also help to refine the IT selection criteria to be used in the future.

2. Legislative and Regulatory Environment Overview

Implementation of IT security within the federal government is guided by a combination of legislation,
rules and regulations, and agency-specific policies. The majority of the guidance addresses governing
and executing IT security activities. However, to be funded, IT investments must demonstrate
compliance with all applicable requirements specified in the guidance. A lack of compliance with
identified security controls indicates weaknesses in IT security that should be mitigated at the enterprise
and system levels. Appropriate IT security controls must be thoroughly planned for throughout the
investment life cycle. Costs associated with meeting IT security controls and ensuring effective
protection of federal IT resources should be accounted for in the capital planning process.

2.1   Reporting Requirements

Signed into law in 2002, FISMA requires departments and agencies to integrate IT security into the
capital planning process. Specifically, FISMA:

       Charges OMB and NIST to develop security standards and identify tolerable security risk levels
       Makes NIST standards compulsory for all agencies; FISMA eliminated an agency’s ability to
       obtain waivers on NIST standards [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)]
       Charges agencies to integrate IT security into capital planning.

Figure 2-1 illustrates the relationship between legislation, regulation, and guidance that exists for IT
security and capital planning for the federal government.




               Figure 2-1. Federal IT Security and Capital Planning Legislation,
                                  Regulations, and Guidance

FISMA provides overarching requirements for securing federal resources and ensuring that security is
incorporated into all phases of the investment life cycle. FISMA codifies specific responsibilities of
federal agency officials, addresses protection of agency information resources, calls for agency officials
to manage risk to an appropriate level, and requires agencies to incorporate security into the life cycle of
information systems. FISMA requires agencies to complete an annual program review that includes
                                                      6
conducting self-assessments for all agency systems and conducting a FISMA independent evaluation.
Results from these activities are compiled into a comprehensive FISMA report, which is submitted to
OMB along with the budget year financial documentation. The corrective actions that agencies identify
to mitigate weaknesses found in the FISMA report are documented and tracked in the POA&M.

FISMA reporting includes providing a status of security weaknesses in key areas of a security program.
As required by FISMA, OMB provides specific guidance annually. FISMA reporting guidance specifies
reporting formats and identifies required actions associated with the quarterly and annual reporting.

NIST SP 800-26 identifies a set of security controls applicable to IT systems and provides a self-
assessment checklist that assists program managers and system owners in determining the maturity of
their security program implementation. The NIST SP 800-26 self-assessment results are then used by
agencies to determine their IT security strengths and vulnerabilities and to provide an overview of the
agency’s security posture. NIST SP 800-53 defines a set of minimum security controls for information
systems in support of the certification and accreditation process.

The capital planning requirements, depicted on the left side of Figure 2-1, illustrate how FISMA and
OMB Circular A-11 impact the capital planning process at federal agencies. OMB Circular A-11 directs
agencies to complete Exhibit 300s and an Exhibit 53. The Exhibit 300 reflects an investment’s plan for
capital asset management. In addition, the Exhibit 300 guidance instructs agencies on budget justification
and reporting requirements for major acquisitions and major IT systems or projects. Each year, agencies
complete and submit an Exhibit 300 for each major IT investment. The Exhibit 300 is an input to the
Exhibit 53, which provides the total IT and IT security spending for the year.

The POA&M process provides a direct link to the capital planning process. As Figure 2-1 illustrates, the
POA&M information includes the costs of corrective actions that have to be captured in the Exhibit 300
and rolled into the Exhibit 53, which provides an overview of an agency’s IT portfolio. The Exhibit 53
includes a rollup of all Exhibit 300s and additional IT expenses from across the agency. All IT
investments are identified by mission area and include their budget year and life-cycle cost, as well as the
percentage of their costs that are devoted to IT security. All costs are totaled across the agency to provide
an overall picture of the agency’s IT portfolio.

Costs associated with each POA&M item are required to map to annual budget requests in the Exhibit
300s and the Exhibit 53. These costs are captured as a component of the percentage of IT security, or
the percentage of the total investment for the budget year associated with IT security in the Exhibit 300,
and are then aggregated in the Exhibit 53. Typically, these costs include:8

        Direct costs of providing IT security for the specific IT investment. Examples include the
        following:9
            o Risk assessment
            o Security planning and policy
            o Certification and accreditation (C&A)
            o Specific security controls10
            o Authentication or cryptographic applications
            o Education, awareness, and training
            o System reviews/evaluations (including system security test and evaluation [ST&E])
            o Oversight or compliance inspections
            o Development or maintenance of agency reports to OMB and corrective action plans as they
              pertain to the specific investment

            o Physical and environmental controls for hardware and software
            o Auditing and monitoring
            o Computer security investigations and forensics
            o Reviews, inspections, audits, and other evaluations performed on contractor facilities and
              operations
            o Privacy impact assessments
        Products, procedures, and personnel that have an incidental or integral component and/or a
        quantifiable benefit for the specific IT investment. Examples include the following:
            o Configuration or change management control
            o Personnel security
            o Physical security
            o Operations security
            o Privacy training
            o Program/system evaluations whose primary purpose is other than security
            o System administrator functions
            o System upgrades with new features that obviate the need for other stand-alone security
              controls
        Allocated security control costs for networks that provide some or all necessary security controls
        for associated applications. Examples include the following:
            o Firewalls
            o IDSs
            o Forensic capabilities
            o Authentication capabilities (e.g., PKI)
            o Additional ‘add-on’ security considerations.

Ongoing security costs (operations and maintenance costs) are combined with the specific remediation
costs and are submitted to OMB in the Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 for the budget year. Section 4.7
provides further details on the Exhibit 300 and Exhibit 53.

2.2     Select-Control-Evaluate Investment Life Cycle

In concert with the OMB capital planning and NIST security requirements, agencies are required to
adhere to the GAO’s best practices, three-phased investment life-cycle model for federal IT investments.
As articulated in the GAO’s Information Technology Investment Evaluation Guide,11 the three phases—
Select, Control, and Evaluate—ensure that investment management practices, including security, are
disciplined and thorough throughout each phase of the investment life cycle. Figure 2-2 illustrates the
three phases.

The Select phase refers to activities associated with assessing and prioritizing current and proposed IT
projects based on mission needs and improvement priorities and then creating a portfolio of IT projects to
address the needs and priorities. Typical Select phase activities include screening new projects; analyzing
and ranking all projects based on benefit, cost, and risk criteria; selecting a portfolio of projects; and
establishing project review schedules.

  The guide is available on GAO’s Web site at the following address: http://www.gao.gov/policy/itguide/homepage.htm

                 Figure 2-2. The Select-Control-Evaluate Investment Life Cycle

The Control phase refers to activities designated to monitor the investment during its operational phase to
determine if the investment is within the cost and schedule milestones established at the beginning of the
investment life cycle. Typical processes involved in the Control phase include using a set of performance
measures to monitor the developmental progress for each IT project to enable early problem identification
and resolution.

The Evaluate phase refers to determining the efficacy of the investment, answering the question, “Did the
investment achieve the desired results and performance goals identified during the Select phase?”

2.2.1    Select Phase

The Select phase typically consists of all of the activities of a business case analysis (BCA). The BCA
process is important in the selection of an investment because it enables decision-makers to consider the
potential of several investment alternatives before making an acquisition decision. The BCA provides a
consistent framework for looking at key variables such as cost of the alternative, benefits the alternative
yields, and associated investment risk. These factors can then be compared across a range of alternatives
so a single investment alternative can be selected.

A well-prepared BCA incorporates both financial metrics and non-financial factors into a concise and
informative presentation. The BCA should also clearly address key issues and facts while revealing the
investment’s contribution in context to the entire agency and its mission. The following objectives are the
components necessary to compose a comprehensive BCA:

        Evaluate Mission and Objectives. The BCA should identify the agency’s mission and objectives
        and explain how the investment will enable the agency to fulfill them.
        Assess Current Environment. The status quo environment, or the way processes are performed
        today, should be thoroughly explained in the context of the agency’s “to-be” enterprise
        architecture (EA) blueprint.
        Perform Gap Analysis. The BCA should include a discussion of the desired “to be” state. In
        other words, it should describe the optimal environment to support the agency mission and goals,
        and point out the necessary steps, procedures, etc., that lie between the status quo and the optimal
        environment.

                                                      9
        Identify Investment Alternatives. The BCA should identify investment alternatives in
        accordance to budget year Exhibit 300 guidance to reach the optimal environment described in the
        Gap Analysis.
        Estimate Cost. A defined cost element structure should be included for each alternative, and life-
        cycle costs should be incorporated to demonstrate the financial impact of each alternative across
        the investment life cycle.
        Perform Sensitivity Analysis. Individual cost assumptions and variable values should be adjusted
        over specified ranges, and the total costs should be estimated. The resulting relationship between
        changes in total cost and changes in each variable can be quantified to capture the sensitivity of
        each variable/cost.
        Characterize Benefits. Benefits that will accrue as a result of each alternative should be identified
        and quantified where possible. When quantifiable, the benefits should be compared against life-
        cycle cost estimates to demonstrate any possible returns on the investment.
        Perform Risk Analysis. Investment risk analyses (including security risks) should be conducted
        for the alternatives, and costs should be adjusted commensurate with anticipated risk.

The objective of a BCA is to measure and illustrate the full impact of an investment within distinct
functional areas to make cost and benefit projections on a larger scale. The result of the BCA is clearly
the justified selection of a preferred alternative for investment consideration.

2.2.2    Control Phase

Once the preferred alternative is identified and acquisition has taken place, the investment management
cycle moves into the Control phase. The primary focus of the Control phase is to document and maintain
all current investment processes. During the Control phase, investment owners/project managers should
use performance metrics to actively track investment cost and performance at specific milestones as the
investment progresses toward meeting its expected mission benefits.

The following management and reporting actions help to improve the accountability and effectiveness of
federal investments by establishing, assessing, correcting, and reporting on management controls:

        Review cost metrics and performance indicators
        Assess accountability of results continuously
        Update analyses of each investment’s costs and benefits
        Monitor investment costs consistently
        Document all processes and associated costs
        Aggregate cost data and review corrective actions taken to date
        Determine customer satisfaction
        Assess milestone completion/schedule adherence
        Analyze goal achievement
        Evaluate system uptime and other performance indicators as they relate to performance goals.

This disciplined analysis and reporting will allow management to identify and resolve problems early so
they can be fixed before they grow into larger problems. For example, management scrutiny and
continuous monitoring will facilitate thorough annual FISMA and budget reporting to OMB.




                                                      10
2.2.3       Evaluate Phase

The Evaluate phase assesses the investment’s impact and determines future costs for ongoing
investments. Annual evaluations determine whether the investment is meeting cost, schedule, and
performance goals. At the conclusion of the investment life cycle, the Evaluate phase largely consists of
PIR. The feedback and lessons learned generated from the Evaluate phase can be used to refine processes
within the Select and Control phases. The following are the key steps to be followed in the Evaluate
phase as part of the PIR:

           Compare the investment’s actual costs, benefits, risks, and return information against earlier
           projections and determine the causes of any differences between planned and actual results.
           For each investment in operation, decide whether it should (1) continue operating without
           adjustment, (2) be further modified to improve performance, (3) be replaced, or (4) be canceled.
           Based on the lessons learned in the PIR, the organization can develop lessons learned and
           incorporate these findings into its overall investment processes to continue improving the
           investment management approach.

The data collection and processing steps inherent in the Evaluate phase are an extension of the data
recorded in the Control phase. Following the implementation of each investment, reviews should be
conducted to determine whether the investments achieved their mission and goals.

2.3       Earned Value Management

Throughout the investment life cycle, agencies should conduct disciplined monitoring to evaluate
investment performance and ensure that the investment yields its forecasted benefits to the agency and
affected stakeholders. Earned Value Management (EVM) is a systematic integration and measurement
of cost, schedule, and accomplishments of an investment that enables agencies to evaluate investment
performance during Development, Modernization, and/or Enhancement (D/M/E).

In traditional investment management situations, there are two data sources: budgeted (or planned)
expenditures and actual expenditures. The comparison of budget versus actual expenditures merely
indicates planned spending versus what was actually spent at any given time. This analysis does not
address how much has been produced for the amount of money spent or if the investment is maturing
according to schedule. Therefore, traditional management approaches do not convey the true cost
performance of the investment. However, with EVM, the project manager can identify how much money
and time a particular investment is likely to require before selecting it and once selected, how much
money was spent at any given time. Furthermore, once selected, the project manager can determine what
work has been accomplished to date for the funds expended and how long it will take the investment to
reach maturity. Commercial off-the-shelf Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) or customized
tracking systems can be used to monitor earned value metrics across the investment life cycle.

OMB has recognized the utility of EVM for D/M/E investments. OMB Circular A-1112 requires agencies
to use an EVMS along with qualified project managers in order for investment spending to be approved
for the fiscal year (FY) and beyond. OMB does not require steady state investments to use EVM.13
However, OMB Circular A-11 does direct agencies to conduct operational assessments of steady-state
investments to demonstrate the investment’s performance against cost, schedule, and performance goals.
The NIST SP 800-26 self-assessment can be used to perform an operational analysis for IT security.

For annual reporting purposes, agencies are required to document their EVM approach for D/M/E
investments in Section I.H., Project (Investment) and Funding Plan, of the annual Exhibit 300. The

                                                                   11
Exhibit 300 requires project managers to report the investment’s progress against the baseline, Budgeted
Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP), and Actual Cost of
Work Performed (ACWP), as well as the cost, schedule, and performance variance. If project managers
do not use EVMS for D/M/E investments, OMB will not give the investment’s Exhibit 300 Section I.H. a
passing score. Failure to earn a passing score on Section I.H. puts the investment’s entire Exhibit 300 at
risk for failing and for losing funding. Therefore, EVM is critical not only to investment success but also
to securing the funding necessary to acquire and operate IT investments.

While EVM provides a project management approach that provides critical information to the investment
management process for enterprise-wide IT security investments, it can also be used to ensure that
appropriate security controls are incorporated for D/M/E investments where IT security is embedded into
the investment. For example, the work breakdown structure and project plan—required for EVM—should
detail when security milestones (e.g., C&A, system security plan completion, security controls testing)
will be achieved and what their costs will be. EVM enables the project manager to assess whether the
controls are implemented in a timely fashion. The corrective action prioritization framework described in
Section 4 identifies how the project manager can use corrective action impacts to determine the level of
benefit the security control will provide the investment and the agency. Thus, the combination of EVM
and the corrective action prioritization framework can be used to ensure that investment security controls
are implemented on schedule and yield the appropriate benefits.

2.4    Information Technology Investment Management

GAO has developed a five-stage model for assessing the maturity of agencies’ investment management
practices that encompasses portfolio management practices in addition to the Select-Control-Evaluate
investment life cycle and the EVM investment evaluation approach. The GAO Information Technology
Investment Management (ITIM) maturity framework can be used to determine the current status of an
agency’s IT investment management capabilities and recommend additional steps an agency can take to
strengthen its approach to IT investment management. As agencies work to develop corrective action
prioritization techniques, they can use the ITIM framework to help their overall portfolio management
techniques to mature.

As referenced in Figure
2-3, each of the five
stages builds on the
preceding stages and
represents increased
capabilities and maturing
investment management
practices.

Each stage is composed
of critical processes and
key practices that are
essential to achieving
investment management
maturity. IT security is
intertwined within the
critical practices for each
maturity step. As shown
in Figure 2-3, as the
agency’s investment                                    Figure 2-3. ITIM Maturity Model14

management process matures, its level of project oversight increases. With the increased project
oversight formality, investment risk and security become key issues for the individual investments and the
entire IT portfolio. Therefore, increased focus on investment and portfolio security and risk levels is
required for agencies to advance through the five ITIM stages.

Agencies at Stage 1 maturity level are characterized by unstructured investment management practices.
There are no clearly articulated criteria for investment success or failure, leading to unpredictable project
outcomes. Agencies at the Stage 1 maturity level are generally assumed to have a basic, inconsistent
investment selection process.

As agencies mature to Stage 2 of the ITIM maturity framework, they begin to develop repeatable and
sustainable investment selection and control processes. Stage 2 maturity focuses on aligning investments
with agency mission and goals; controlling cost, benefit, schedule, and risk (CBSR) milestones to
improve project outcomes; and engaging in formal investment reviews from an IRB. Another key aspect
of Stage 2 is the creation of a system inventory to ensure the agency can identify CBSR and investment
ownership information and review investment performance accordingly.

The system inventory is a cornerstone of the ITIM framework and also relates directly to investment
security concerns. Both FISMA and the ITIM framework require the development of a system inventory.
FISMA requires the inventory to identify the interfaces between each system and all other systems and
networks, including those not operated by or under the control of the agency. The FISMA requirement
stems from OMB’s expectation that each agency have such an inventory in accordance with its work on
developing its EA. FISMA also requires that the inventory be updated at least annually. Agencies should
work to build a single system inventory that meets the requirements of both the ITIM framework and
FISMA.

Building on the system inventory in Stage 2, Stage 3 moves beyond the Select and Control investment
phases and focuses on enterprise portfolio creation, management, and evaluation. The PIR is the principal
means for agencies to evaluate their investments’ impacts. The PIR is conducted after investment
acquisition is completed. The PIR examines the outcome of the investment relative to its plans and
expectations. Analyzing PIRs across the investment portfolio enables agencies to identify strong
investment management practices and improve their investment management approaches. Also, the
increased responsibility of the IRBs builds a foundation for portfolio review and management across the
agency. By evaluating IT portfolios across the enterprise, agencies at the Stage 3 maturity level can begin
to evaluate the investment’s CBSR to determine which portfolio structure will achieve its mission goals
while reducing risk to the agency. The information contained in the system inventory provides key
indicators for assessing each investment and the portfolio as a whole.

As agencies mature to Stage 4, maturing investment management practices allow agencies to assess
whether or not existing investments should continue, be modified, or be canceled. Agencies can also
begin to examine new technologies and investments to potentially replace outdated investments and
technology.

Agencies that have reached Stage 5, the pinnacle of the ITIM maturity framework, are marked by their
ability to learn from other organizations and, more importantly, to continually improve their investment
management practices to achieve positive business outcomes. Agencies at Stage 5 are able to benchmark
their IT investment processes relative to other “best-in-class” organizations and can proactively evaluate
their IT portfolios and emerging investment and technology opportunities to change and improve their
overall agency performance.

2.5   Plan of Action and Milestones
Throughout the investment life cycle, the POA&M is used to identify security weaknesses and track
mitigation efforts for agency IT investments until the weakness has been successfully mitigated. A robust
POA&M process is indicative of increasing ITIM maturity across the agency. OMB requires agencies to
                                                     13
prepare and submit POA&Ms for all programs and systems where an IT security weakness has been
found. A weakness can be thought of as the gap between current program and system security status and
the intended goal/requirement. For example, operating without a contingency plan is a weakness if the
system is supposed to have a contingency plan. The POA&M in this example would detail the tasks and
milestones to develop, implement, and test a contingency plan.

Prior year (PY) FISMA reporting guidance codifies the exact reporting requirements of the POA&M and
should be referenced to ensure the agency is reporting required information to OMB. Table 2-1 contains
10 reporting sections that are typically found in POA&M reporting guidance. However, as previously
stated, agencies should reference PY FISMA reporting guidance to ensure they report desired information
to OMB. In addition to the POA&M sections listed in Table 2-1, all POA&Ms must contain a unique
project identifier. This identifier, which appears in the POA&M, the Exhibit 300, and the Exhibit 53, ties
the security costs for the corrective actions in the POA&M to the annual budget information contained in
the Exhibit 300 and the Exhibit 53.

                                            Table 2-1. POA&M Sections15




OMB directs agency CIOs and agency program officials to develop, implement, and manage POA&Ms
for all programs and systems they operate and control as a part of FISMA compliance. In addition,
POA&Ms must be shared with the agency IG to ensure independent evaluation and verification of
identified weaknesses and proposed mitigation strategies.

POA&Ms are used at the program level to identify and track weaknesses across enterprise-level initiatives
and at the system level to identify and track system-specific weaknesses. Agencies are required to submit
POA&Ms to OMB upon request to provide an update on progress against planned remediation efforts.
OMB also requires quarterly POA&M update reports to follow the format presented in Figure 2-4.
Agencies should reference the latest POA&M reporting guidance from OMB for the most current
quarterly reporting requirements and due dates.


15
  Note – OMB does not require the “Security Compliance Gap Percentage” entry on POA&M submissions. However, it is
 useful for agencies to determine the investment’s compliance to facilitate prioritization of corrective actions. See Section 4 for
 an explanation on how to calculate the security compliance gap percentage.
                                                                 14
Because the POA&M can be used to track weaknesses at both the agency and system/program level, and
it contains the costs/resources necessary to mitigate the identified weaknesses, it is valuable to the
corrective action prioritization methodology presented in this guidance. Using the POA&M substantially
limits additional data collection because the POA&M contains many of the data points necessary for
successful prioritization as discussed in Section 4.

2.6   Risk

Throughout the investment life cycle, risk management is essential to ensure the investment yields the
intended results. While this guidance focuses on security risks, they are only one type of risk that
investments face. Therefore, risk management for IT investments can be thought of as a two-pronged
approach that includes:
       Security risks: risks associated with exploiting IT vulnerabilities and weaknesses
       Investment risks: risks associated with the potential inability to achieve overall program
       objectives within defined cost, schedule, and technical constraints.
In practical implementation, monitoring and mitigating IT security risks is usually at the forefront of IT
strategic planning. NIST SP 800-30 contains a comprehensive approach to risk management and can be
used as a reference for instituting and maintaining an IT security risk management process. However,
monitoring and mitigating investment risks are equally important to successfully achieving intended
investment outcomes. Without a strong and consistently applied risk management process, project
managers are more likely to:

       Assign inadequate resources to mitigate or resolve major risks
       Make key decisions without adequate information

                                                    15
           Have little insight into potential problems
           Repeat mistakes that plagued earlier projects
           Devote resources to addressing problems rather than avoiding them in the first place
           Fail to deliver a compliant product or service on time and within budget.

Comprehensive risk assessments effectively apply a risk management process that integrates the skills,
knowledge, and experience of a variety of specialists to address IT security risks and investment risks.
OMB has identified 19 categories of risk. They are:16

           Schedule: Risk associated with schedule slippages, either from lack of internal controls or from
           those associated with late delivery by vendors, resulting in missed milestones.
           Initial costs: Risk associated with “cost creep” or miscalculation of initial costs that result in an
           inaccurate baseline against which to estimate and compare future costs.
           Life-cycle costs: Risk associated with misestimating life-cycle costs and exceeding forecasts and
           relying on a small number of vendors without sufficient cost controls.
           Technical obsolescence: Risk associated with technology that becomes obsolete before the
           completion of the life cycle and cannot provide the planned and desired functionality.
           Feasibility: Risk that the proposed alternative fails to result in the desired technological outcomes;
           risk that business goals of the program or initiative will not be achieved; risk that the program
           effectiveness targeted by the project will not be achieved.
           Reliability of systems: Risk associated with vulnerability/integrity of systems.
           Dependencies and interoperability between this investment and others: Risk associated with
           interoperability between other investments; risk that interoperable systems will not achieve desired
           outcomes; risk of increased vulnerabilities among systems.
           Surety (asset protection) considerations: Risk associated with the loss/misuse of data or
           information; risk of technical problems/failures with applications; risk associated with the
           security/vulnerability of systems.
           Risk of creating a monopoly for future procurements: Risk associated with choosing an
           investment that depends on other technologies or applications that require future procurements to
           be from a particular vendor or supplier.
           Capability of agency to manage the investment: Risk of financial management of investment,
           poor operational and technical controls, or reliance on vendors without appropriate cost, technical,
           and operational controls; risk that business goals of the program or initiative will not be achieved;
           risk that the program effectiveness targeted by the project will not be achieved.
           Overall risk of project failure: Risk that the project/investment will not result in the desired
           outcomes.
           Project resources/financial: Risk associated with “cost creep,” miscalculation of life-cycle costs,
           reliance on a small number of vendors without cost controls, or inadequate acquisition planning.
           Technical/technology: Risk associated with immaturity of commercially available technology and
           reliance on a small number of vendors; risk of technical problems/failures with applications and
           their inability to provide planned and desired technical functionality.
           Business/operational: Risk associated with business goals; risk that the proposed alternative fails
           to result in process efficiencies and streamlining; risk that business goals of the program or
           initiative will not be achieved; risk that the investment will not achieve operational goals; risk that
           the program effectiveness targeted by the project will not be achieved.


16
     Risk definitions are a combination of OMB-provided definitions and best practices definitions.
                                                                 16
       Organizational and change management: Risk associated with organizational-, agency-, or
       government-wide cultural resistance to change and standardization; risk associated with bypassing,
       lack/improper use of, or non-adherence to new systems and processes because of organizational
       structure and culture; risk associated with inadequate training planning.
       Data/information: Risk associated with the loss or misuse of data or information; risk of
       compromise of citizen or corporate privacy information; risk of increased burdens on citizens and
       businesses because of data collection requirements if the associated business processes or project
       (being described in the Exhibit 300) requires access to data from other sources (federal, state,
       and/or local agencies).
       Security: Risk associated with the security/vulnerability of systems, Web sites, and information
       and networks; risk of intrusions and connectivity to other (vulnerable) systems; risk associated
       with the evolution of credible threats; risk associated with the criminal/fraudulent misuse of
       information; must include level of risk (high, moderate, low) and what aspect of security
       determines the level of risk (e.g., need for confidentiality of information associated with the
       project/system, availability of the information or system, or integrity of the information or system).
       Strategic: Risk associated with strategic- and government-wide goals (e.g., President’s
       Management Agenda [PMA] and e-Gov initiative goals); risk that the proposed alternative fails to
       result in achieving those goals or in making contributions to them.
       Privacy: Risk associated with the vulnerability of information collected on individuals or risk of
       vulnerability of proprietary information on businesses.

In addition to the 19 OMB-defined areas of risk, a comprehensive risk assessment should include the
assessment of each of the following categories:

       Product Risk Assessment: Identifies those risks associated with a given system concept. This
       technique is used to identify and analyze risks in the following critical risk areas: design and
       engineering, technology, logistics, production, concurrency, and both hardware and software.
       Process Risk Assessment: Analyzes program technical risks resulting from the contractor’s
       processes. The primary benefit of this assessment addresses pervasive and important sources of
       risk in most investments.
       Threat and Requirements Risk Assessment: Assesses risks related to risk drivers. To a large
       degree, operational needs, environmental demands, and threats determine system performance
       requirements. They are a major factor in driving the design of the system and can introduce risk in
       an investment.
       Cost Risk Assessment: Provides an investment-level cost-estimate-at-completion that is a
       function of performance and schedule risks.
       Quantified Schedule Risk Assessment: Provides a means to determine investment-level
       schedule risk as a function of risk associated with various activities that compose the investment.

All risks contribute to the calculation of risk-adjusted cost, which OMB now requires agencies to report
in each investment’s Exhibit 300. The risk-adjusted cost calculation provides a range of how the
investment’s costs will be affected if part or all the investment and security risks identified in the Exhibit
300 manifest themselves. The risk-adjusted costs provide realistic forecasts across the investment life
cycle, allowing decision-makers to plan appropriately for risks to the investment. The forecasts will also
allow OMB to determine whether the risk-adjusted cost precludes the investment from receiving funding
because of the potential financial burden caused by investment risks.

3. IT Security and Capital Planning Integration Roles and Responsibilities

Integrating IT security into the capital planning process requires input and collaboration across agencies
and functions. Figure 3-1 depicts a hierarchical approach to capital planning in which investment
decisions are made at both the enterprise and operating unit levels. A certain level of investment
management maturity is assumed in the framework presented in Figure 3-1




                         Figure 3-1. Notional IT Management Hierarchy

While specific practices for investment management vary greatly at the operating unit level because of
varying sizes and missions of the operating units, the process generally mirrors the process at the
departmental level. The CIO formulates and articulates IT security priorities to the organization to be
considered within the context of all agency investments. Priorities may be based on agency mission,
executive branch guidance such as the PMA, OMB guidance, or other external/internal priorities.
Examples of security priorities include certifying and accrediting all systems or implementing PKI
throughout the enterprise. (It is important to note that OMB/Executive Branch guidance or laws should
be ranked highest among these priorities.)

Once operating units finalize their IT portfolios and budget requests for the budget year, they forward
their requests to the agency-level decision makers. At the agency level, several committees evaluate IT
portfolios from the operating units as referenced in Figure 3-1, culminating in a review by the IRB. The
IRB then decides on an agency-level IT portfolio and forwards recommendations to the agency head for
review. Once the agency-level IT portfolio is approved by the agency head, the necessary Exhibit 300s
and Exhibit 53 are forwarded to OMB to obtain funding.

Generally, project managers in operating units manage investments according to federal and agency
policies, the CIO-articulated priorities, and specific operating unit priorities. Project managers also
identify vulnerabilities and needed corrective actions for their investments. Each year, project managers
prepare and submit Exhibit 300s to the operating unit management and operating unit IRBs. These

                                                    18
Exhibit 300s for mixed life-cycle and steady-state investments are combined with Exhibit 300s for new
investments and are prioritized at the operating unit level to determine the appropriate IT portfolio mix for
the budget year.

The described IT management framework will vary from agency to agency. The important element
common to all agencies, though, should be standardized approval hierarchies and parallel planning and
prioritization processes at both the enterprise and operating unit levels.

3.1   Overview
Many different stakeholders from IT security, capital planning, and executive leadership areas play roles
and make decisions on integrating IT security into the capital planning process and ultimately forming a
well-balanced IT portfolio. Figure 3-2 illustrates the roles and responsibilities hierarchy for integrating IT
security into the CPIC process. While specific roles and responsibilities will vary from agency to agency,
involvement at the enterprise and operating unit levels throughout the process allows agencies to ensure
that capital planning and IT security goals and objectives are met. Figure 3-2 identifies leading,
supporting, or approving roles for each stakeholder as they apply to the integration of security into the
CPIC process phases.




             Figure 3-2. Roles and Responsibilities Throughout the CPIC Process

Sections 3.2 through 3.12 describe stakeholder roles and responsibilities.

4. Integration of Security into the CPIC Process

The CPIC process is defined by OMB Circular A-130 as “a management process for ongoing
identification, selection, control, and evaluation of investments in information resources. The process
links budget formulation and execution, and is focused on agency missions and achieving specific
program outcomes.” Integrating security into this process ensures that information resources are planned
and provided for in a thorough, disciplined manner, ultimately enabling improved security for IT
investments.

4.1   The CPIC Process and IT Security

Integrating security into the CPIC process consists
of a seven-step methodology to ensure that mission
and security requirements are met throughout the
investment life cycle. Figure 4-1depicts the seven-
step methodology of integrating security into the
CPIC process

As Figure 4-1 indicates, key activities and
decisions take place throughout the CPIC process
to ensure that security requirements are identified,
planned for, and implemented as a part of an
individual IT investment or the overall agency
investment portfolio. The first step is to identify the
security baseline using IT security metrics to
determine where security weaknesses exist.
Following identification of the baseline,
prioritization requirements are established.
Corrective actions to mitigate vulnerabilities must
be evaluated against the security requirements.
Requirements can be CIO-articulated security
priorities, enterprise-wide initiatives, or as shown
in the example in this guidance document, NIST SP
800-26 topic areas. Following identification of the
prioritization criteria, corrective actions should be
prioritized against the criteria on the basis of cost
and impact, first at the enterprise level and then at
the system level. Once corrective actions have
been prioritized, business cases and Exhibit 300s
should be developed and submitted to the IRB for

investment portfolio and funding levels necessary for submission to OMB via Exhibit 53 and the Exhibit

schedule, and performance goals set forth in the Exhibit 300.

The activities and decisions that occur throughout the CPIC process relate to critical milestones in the
investment life cycle. Figure 4-2 maps the CPIC steps and activities to each phase of the Select-Control-
Evaluate investment life cycle.




           Figure 4-2. IT Security Activities Throughout the Investment Life Cycle

Figure 4-3 illustrates the relationship among the security drivers, the investment life cycle, and the
System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

During the Select phase, security drivers include assessment activities to ensure that IT security
investments comply with security requirements, discussed in Section 2.1. During the Control phase,
investments are monitored through the use of security metrics to ensure that security controls are in place
and operational and that investments remain compliant with requirements. During the Evaluate phase,
security drivers include self-assessment activities to ensure compliance and media sanitization efforts
following removal from operation and prior to disposition.

4.2     Identify Baseline

The first step of the CPIC process is to assess the security baseline. The security baseline provides a
snapshot of the agency’s compliance with baseline security requirements (BLSR) and is instrumental in
identifying IT security strengths and weaknesses. The result of a security baseline analysis enables
agency executives to evaluate their IT security posture and identify areas for improvement.

Agencies can identify their baseline at two levels:

      1. The investment-level baseline evaluates each IT investment’s compliance with regulations and
         the overall security posture at the system level.
      2. The enterprise-level baseline aggregates the investment-level results to provide an overall
         security posture assessment across the agency.

As Figure 4-4 illustrates, an information security metrics program is the best way to define the security
baseline. NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides
guidance on developing and implementing an information security metrics program. Information security
metrics programs use existing data sources to create a quantifiable picture of the security posture of
individual IT investments and then aggregate that data to provide an overview across the organization.
Metrics programs can assess IT security investments’ compliance with NIST SP 800-26 topic areas,
FISMA requirements, and agency regulations. Metrics can provide compliance percentages that indicate
the existence of adequate security controls, highlight current weaknesses, and identify gaps between
actual and desired IT security controls implementation. Information about these gaps provides inputs into
requirements for mitigation efforts, such as identifying corrective actions that mitigate the vulnerabilities
and improve the security controls across the agency.




                                                      25
                          Figure 4-4. Identifying Baseline Best Practices

If an agency does not have a mature or robust IT security metrics program, there are other sources of
information that can be used to establish the IT security baseline. OMB POA&Ms, agency-specific
security reviews, GAO and IG audit findings, risk assessments, incident statistics, and other information
can be assembled to provide an overview of an agency’s security posture showing where security
investments are needed. The advantages of a mature metrics program are the simplification of data
collection, reporting versus consolidating information from a variety of assessments, and the ability to
trend results over time. A mature metrics program is also more cost effective than ad hoc data collection
from multiple data sources. Whether the agency uses an IT security metrics program or other methods for
assessing the information security baseline, the output remains consistent: an understanding of the
strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities that exist within an agency’s security controls that underscore
where investments are required. The resulting vulnerabilities and weaknesses then serve as inputs into the
next step of the CPIC process: identifying prioritization criteria.

4.3   Identify Prioritization Criteria

To identify appropriate prioritization criteria, agencies should use the security baseline in determining
how to allocate resources. Each agency should implement corrective actions for each identified
vulnerability and weakness to ensure its IT portfolio complies with federal mandates and demonstrates
security controls commensurate with the sensitivity of each investment. However, available funding does
not always allow all security baseline needs assessment requirements to be addressed immediately.
Therefore, requirements must be prioritized to address the most pressing security investment needs first.
Without a systematic risk management approach, such prioritization can be difficult.

Corrective actions should be prioritized to ensure the most efficient use of resources, including personnel
time and mitigation costs. However, to effectively prioritize corrective actions, agencies must identify
criteria for prioritization. Specific prioritization criteria will vary from agency to agency; however, the
common approach is to rank order IT security investments.




                                                    26
Examples of general prioritization criteria include:

Other criteria include IT security priorities. Security priorities embody an agency’s approach to IT
security. They are articulated and promulgated by the agency CIO or other senior management officials,
and evolve over time to reflect the changing maturity level of the agency’s security program. Security
priorities can be proactive in an effort to stay ahead of potential threats, or they can be reactive to comply
with legislative requirements. Examples of IT security priorities include:
           Complying with statutory requirements in Clinger-Cohen Act, FISMA, and OMB A-130 guidance
           Implementing a risk-based security program (FISMA and Executive Orders)
           Safeguarding national and agency mission-critical assets (Homeland Security Presidential
           Directives)
           Improving Information Security Program status
           Completing C&A of all systems in accordance with NIST guidance and standards.17

Agency operating units will develop their IT security investment strategies in alignment with the CIO-
articulated IT security priorities and agency-identified prioritization criteria. When combined,
prioritization criteria and CIO-articulated priorities form specific prioritization frameworks that allow
investments to be rank-ordered against requirements. Examples of specific prioritization frameworks
include:
            Strategic view
              o Linkage with a government-wide initiative
              o Impact on agency goals
              o Impact on e-Government scorecard improvement
              o Mission criticality

requirements, the agency must begin the prioritizing process by
rank-ordering requirements against the prioritization criteria. The objective is to apply the first security
dollar to the most critical security investment. The next dollar is then applied to the next critical security
investment and so forth until the security budget is expended.

To determine a rank order of topic areas for an agency, multiple stakeholders should meet and agree on
the prioritization scheme. Stakeholders may include the CIO, senior security officials, key system
owners, and members of the IRB. A high degree of coordination is required to perform this activity
successfully to ensure buy-in from all parties. It is important to bring stakeholders together early in the
process and involve them throughout the process. It also may be helpful to have a facilitated session
using a decision support tool to coordinate input from multiple parties.

After determining the system- and enterprise-level baselines and after establishing prioritization criteria,
an agency can prioritize corrective actions at the same two levels:

      1. System-level prioritization – prioritize corrective actions to address system-level security
         weaknesses and vulnerabilities found during the baseline assessment against the predefined
         prioritization criteria. This prioritization occurs at the operating unit level by system owners and
         project managers. This information should be available from an agency’s POA&M.
      2. Enterprise-level prioritization – prioritize enterprise-wide security corrective actions identified
         during the baseline assessment based on predefined prioritization criteria. This prioritization
         occurs at the enterprise level by senior agency officials.

In addition to prioritizing requirements at the system and enterprise levels, two other data points are
needed for the prioritization process:

      1. Compliance gap – the difference between the desired and actual compliance with the security
         requirements. For example, if an IT system has completed 80 percent of C&A activities, that
         investment would have a C&A compliance gap of 20 percent. (The actual compliance of 80
         percent is subtracted from the desired compliance of 100 percent to yield a 20 percent compliance
                                                      28
         gap.) The smaller the compliance gap, the more compliant the system or enterprise control. This
         information is part of the FISMA report.
    2. Corrective action impact – the ratio of compliance gap to corrective action cost. The formula
       for corrective action impact appears in Figure 4-5. As illustrated, the corrective action impact is
       calculated by dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to implement the corresponding
       corrective action(s). This ratio provides a proportion of result to cost. The higher the impact
       proportion, the more “bang for the buck” the corrective action will provide. The resulting
       proportion is multiplied by 100,000 to facilitate further calculations.

                     ⎛ Corrective Action Security Compliance Gap % ⎞
                     ⎜⎜                                            ⎟⎟ × 100,000
                      ⎝           Corrective Action Cost            ⎠
                                Figure 4-5. Corrective Action Impact

As an example of the corrective action impact, if an IT investment has completed 80 percent of C&A
activities, and the remaining cost to complete C&A is $150,000, the corrective action impact would be:


                                       ⎛ 20 % ⎞
                                       ⎜          ⎟ × 100,000 = .13
                                       ⎝ $150,000 ⎠

NIST SP 800-26 assesses the current security posture of information systems. As a result, it is a good
benchmark for assessing system and agency security and is used in the example in this guidance. If an
agency determined that one of its prioritization requirements was to comply with the 17 NIST SP 800-26
topic areas, and another prioritization criteria was to address the most sensitive systems first, it would
need to:

        Rank-order the topic areas in order of importance to the agency
        Rank-order agency systems according to FIPS 199 category
        Calculate the compliance gaps at the enterprise and investment levels
        Calculate the corrective action impact at the enterprise and investment levels.

These four steps are articulated in greater detail in the subsequent sections of this guidance.

4.4.1    Enterprise-level Prioritization

To repeat the example above, if an agency determined that its prioritization requirements were to be
compliant with the 17 NIST SP 800-26 topic areas and to address the most sensitive systems first, it
would need to conduct prioritization at the enterprise level first to determine which NIST SP 800-26 topic
areas should be addressed across the agency.

To begin the process, agency executives should have already rank-ordered the 17 NIST SP 800-26 topic
areas using an analytical hierarchy tool. For the purposes of this exercise, agency executives should rank
the topic areas into one of three categories—high, moderate, and low—based on the topic area’s
importance to agency mission and goals, and in the context of any CIO-articulated priorities and
enterprise-level initiatives. While every topic area should be of some importance to the agency, in a
resource-constrained environment, each area should be prioritized according to the overall agency
priorities into high, moderate, and low groups. There are no exacting standards for delineation; agencies
should work within their own environment to determine the appropriate number of high, moderate, and
low topic areas.


                                                     29
Following the ranking of the 17 topic areas, agencies should determine the aggregate compliance for each
topic area. This information already exists in each system’s self-assessment, so this exercise is simply
reusing existing data. Once compliance percentages are obtained for each system, the results should be
aggregated across the agency for an overall compliance percentage. Then, the security compliance gap
percentage is calculated by subtracting (from 100 percent) the average compliance across the agency for
each topic area.

The next step is to determine the cost to implement the corrective action. This information is found in the
POA&M; therefore, no new information is needed. For the enterprise-level prioritization, the dollar
amounts for each topic area should be aggregated to obtain a total across the agency. In the event that this
information is not included in the POA&M, it will need to be calculated. There are several ways to derive
costs for POA&M corrective actions. Costing software tools can perform this cost-estimating function, or
the agency can rely on historical prices or existing relationships with vendors to determine corrective
action costs.

Once the security compliance percentage gap and the corrective action costs are obtained, the corrective
action impact can be calculated. As referenced earlier, the corrective action impact is calculated as
follows:
                     ⎛ Corrective Action Security Compliance Gap % ⎞
                     ⎜⎜                                            ⎟⎟ × 100,000
                      ⎝           Corrective Action Cost            ⎠
Finally, after calculating the corrective action impact, agency executives should prioritize the corrective
actions for each topic area according to the corrective action impact. The impact should be delineated
into three categories: great, average, and basic. Agency stakeholders spanning the roles of line operations
to agency executives should determine the boundaries for each of the three categories. For example,
stakeholders could determine that great scores will be greater than or equal to a corrective action impact
score of 0.40, average scores will be between 0.20 and 0.39, and basic scores will be less than 0.20. The
groupings will vary from agency to agency. The important factor is for agencies to develop discrete
boundaries between categories to facilitate the prioritization process.

and Corrective Action Impact calculations are used at the enterprise level. Sorted by corrective action
impact, Figure 4-6 illustrates the ranking process. From left to right, at the enterprise level, the 17 NIST
SP 800-26 topic areas are listed, followed by a delineation of the security control areas by agency
executives into one of three categories – high (H), moderate (M), or low (L). For example, the first topic
area listed—Topic Area 4, Incident Response Capability—received an importance ranking of high.

The compliance gaps are then divided by the cost to implement the corrective action, resulting in the
corrective action impact. For the Incident Response Capability, the calculation appears as follows:

                                        ⎛ 65 % ⎞
                                        ⎜         ⎟ × 100,000 = .80
                                        ⎝ $81,161 ⎠
Figure 4-6 is sorted by corrective action impact because the impact is the focal point of the analysis. The
corrective action impact yields a “best bang-for-the buck” proportion that is essential in the prioritization
process because it signifies high-impact, low-cost corrective actions.

Finally, the far-right column contains the corrective action impact ranking category. In this example,
stakeholders ranked corrective action impacts greater than 0.40 as “great,” impacts between 0.20 and 0.39
as “average,” and impacts less than 0.20 as “basic.” Therefore, Incident Response Capability received a
ranking of “great.”

     The data contained within Figure 4-5 and all other figures within this guidance are for illustrative purposes only. The purpose
     of this figure is neither to imply that it represents an appropriate ranking of topic areas nor that these are correct importance
     rankings. These rankings are variables that will differ within the context of each agency.
                                                                   31
Based on the analysis in Figure 4-6, the
agency is prepared to prioritize its
enterprise-level security controls. Figure
4-7 illustrates the 3x3 matrix technique
that can be used to prioritize at the
enterprise level. If prioritizing via a 3x3
matrix is not viable, a spreadsheet sort
by the “Category” and “Ranking”
columns would also provide a rank-
ordered list that approximates the
prioritization achieved through the 3x3
matrix exercise.

Using the findings in Figure 4-6,
agencies can plot the 17 NIST SP 800-26
security controls within the 3x3 matrix in
Figure 4-7. For example, in Figure 4-6,
Topic Area 4, Incident Response
Capability, has an importance ranking of
“H” for high and a corrective action          Figure 4-7. Enterprise-Level Prioritization Analysis
impact ranking of “G” for great.                                        Matrix
Therefore, this topic area would be
plotted in cell HG, as referenced by the “4” in cell HG. Following this methodology, agencies can plot all
security controls within the 3x3 matrix.

The corrective actions mapped to the HG cell will receive the highest priority because they represent the
corrective actions that received the highest executive ranking for importance to the agency and provide
the greatest reduction in security compliance gaps. In addition, because of the corrective action impact
calculation, the corrective actions that align in HG will demonstrate the most cost-effective corrective
actions. Corrective action priority then moves from high to low along a diagonal line from the upper-
rightmost cell to the lower-leftmost cell. Agency executives must determine the relative importance of
peripheral cells HA, MG, HB, LG, MB, and LA. Based on agency goals and stakeholder priorities,
agencies need to determine if the corrective action impact axis is more important and weight cell MG
higher, or if the security controls ranking axis is more important and weight cell HA higher.

In the example in Figure 4-7, the agency will use a five-step prioritization determination.

    1. Topic Area 4, Incident Response Capability, will receive the highest priority for funding because
       it is the only control area listed in cell HG.
    2. The agency will need to determine the relative importance of cells HA and MG to continue the
       prioritization sequence. If the NIST SP 800-26 security control areas axis is more important, then
       the HA topic areas will precede the MG topic areas. If the corrective action impact axis is more
       important, then MG topic areas will precede HA topic areas.
    3. The next tier to consider consists of cells HB, MA, and LG. Based on the analysis in step 2, the
       next cell within this tier will depend on whether the agency stakeholders placed more importance
       on the NIST SP 800-26 topic areas axis or the corrective action impact axis.
    4. The third tier to consider consists of cells MB and LA. Based on the analysis in step 2, the next
       cell within this tier will depend on whether the agency stakeholders placed more importance on
       the NIST SP 800-26 topic areas axis or the corrective action impact axis.
    5. The prioritization process would conclude with the two topic areas in cell LB.



                                                     32
Following executive validation, the agency should implement the corrective actions from high to low
priority across the agency. However, the agency also has corrective actions for systems to consider in
addition to enterprise-level needs. The same methodology can be applied to a system prioritization that
can then be merged with the enterprise-level prioritization. The ultimate result will provide a prioritized
list of the corrective actions to be implemented within an available budget from both prioritizations:
enterprise-level and system-level.

4.4.2       System-Level Prioritization

Continuing with the example described in Section 4.4.1, the agency would need to prioritize its systems to
determine which ones are the most sensitive and require immediate remediation of their vulnerabilities.
The first input for system-level prioritization is system sensitivity.19

System sensitivity is usually documented in the investment’s system security plan and takes into account
the systems’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Based on these three factors, the system’s
sensitivity is delineated into three categories—high, moderate, and low. This sensitivity categorization
can then be used as a prioritization criterion for mitigating corrective actions by identifying the
investments with the highest sensitivity.

System category or criticality can be used as a system-level prioritization criterion for the purposes of this
guidance. FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
Systems, contains information on determining a system’s criticality. As explained in FIPS 199, system
criticality is a factor of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system’s information.

The next input is the security compliance percentage. This percentage is obtained by evaluating each
system’s compliance with the 17 NIST SP 800-26 topic areas. For example, if a system were 60 percent
compliant with the 17 NIST SP 800-26 topic areas, then the security compliance percentage would be 60
percent. This figure is then subtracted from 100 percent to yield the security compliance gap. Following
the example of a 60 percent security compliance percentage, the security compliance gap would be 40
percent.

The corrective action cost is the next input to the analysis. This number should come directly from the
system’s POA&M. It would reflect the total corrective action costs to mitigate all identified weaknesses
in the POA&M.

Once the security compliance gap and the corrective action cost have been determined, the corrective
action impact can be calculated. Using the same formula as the enterprise-level prioritization, the
corrective action impact is calculated as follows:

                           ⎛ Corrective Action Security Compliance Gap % ⎞
                           ⎜⎜                                            ⎟⎟ × 100,000
                            ⎝           Corrective Action Cost            ⎠
Finally, after the corrective action impact has been calculated, the systems should be prioritized
accordingly. The impacts should be delineated into three categories: great, average, and basic. Agency
stakeholders from line operations to agency executives should determine the thresholds for each of the
three categories. For example, agency stakeholders could determine that great scores will be greater than
or equal to 10.00, average scores will be between 1.00 and 9.99, and basic scores will be less than 1.00.
The groupings will vary from agency to agency. The important factor is for agencies to develop discrete
boundaries between categories to facilitate the prioritization process.

     For additional information on determining system sensitivity or criticality, reference NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security
     Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems; NIST SP 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for
     Information Technology Systems; NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security
     System; NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories; and FIPS
     199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.
                                                                 33
illustrates the system-level prioritization. Using system “N” as an example, moving from left to right, its
system security plan indicates that it is a “high” sensitivity system. System N is 15 percent compliant
with the 17 NIST SP 800-26 topic areas, yielding an 85 percent security compliance gap. The overall
corrective action cost identified in the POA&M is $3,800 to mitigate all vulnerabilities. Based on these
inputs, the corrective action impact is calculated as follows:

                                      ⎛ 85 % ⎞
                                      ⎜        ⎟ × 100,000 = 22.49
                                      ⎝ $3,800 ⎠


Figure 4-8 is sorted by corrective action impact because it is the focal point of the analysis. The
corrective action impact yields a “best bang-for-the-buck” proportion that is essential in the prioritization
process because it signifies high-impact, low-cost corrective actions.




                               Figure 4-8. System-Level Prioritization




                                                     34
As with the previously discussed enterprise-level
prioritization process, a 3x3 matrix can be used to
prioritize agency systems. Figure 4-9 shows such
a matrix.

The prioritization methodology at the system
level mirrors the process at the enterprise level.
Systems map to one of the nine cells based on
their system sensitivity and corrective action
impact scores. For example, system N is a high
sensitivity system with a great corrective action
impact. Therefore, system N would map to cell
HG. As with the enterprise-level prioritization,
the systems that are mapped to the HG cell will
receive the highest priority because they represent
systems with the highest sensitivity ranking and
provide the greatest corrective action impact. The
prioritization process would continue in order of          Figure 4-9. System-level Prioritization

matrix on a diagonal line to the lower-leftmost
cell of the matrix.

4.4.3   Joint Prioritization

The final step in the prioritization process is
to combine the enterprise- and system-level
prioritizations into one prioritization
framework to create a security investment
strategy for the agency. The agency should
map the systems and enterprise-level
controls already prioritized in Sections 4.4.1
and 4.4.2 to the 3x3 matrix presented in
Figure 4-10. For example, all enterprise-
level controls that were in cell HG in Figure
4-7 and all systems that were in cell HG in
Figure 4-9 should appear in cell HG in
Figure 4-10.
                                                  Figure 4-10. Joint Prioritization Analysis Matrix
The prioritization process in Figure 4-10 is
conducted in exactly the same manner as the enterprise and system levels. Cell HG represents the highest
priority systems and enterprise controls, while cell LB represents the lowest priority systems and
enterprise controls. Implementation of enterprise and system-level corrective actions should begin in cell
HG and proceed in a diagonal line towards cell LB. The extent of implementation depends on the security
budget allocations the agency receives or expects.

For example, adding the costs of all enterprise- and system-level corrective actions (presented in Figure
4-6 and Figure 4-8) across the agency yields a total corrective action cost of $4,840,505. However, if the
agency can only allocate $2,000,000 in a particular year to IT security, it can use the prioritization in
Figure 4-11 to determine the appropriate allocation of limited security funds.

Figure 4-11 displays the corrective action costs for each cell. These costs were computed by adding the
system and enterprise costs for the system- and enterprise-level corrective actions within the cells from
Figure 4-6 and Figure 4-8. Once the costs for all prioritized corrective actions are included in the analysis,

                                                      35
key management personnel should collectively agree on the prioritization approach and ensure that it
aligns with agency priorities and spending plans. For example, in some cases, it might be more cost
effective to pursue lesser priority items because of per-seat discounts and other cost/benefit criteria that
are outside the scope of the methodology presented in this guidance.

Plotting all of the systems within the agency’s portfolio on such a graph will provide a snapshot of the
agency’s high-sensitivity, high-corrective action impact systems. After plotting all of its systems, the
agency should perform executive validation of the placement of the various systems to ensure that
stakeholders’ priorities are met.

Assuming the agency stakeholders agree that all prioritized corrective actions are appropriate as displayed
in Figure 4-10, the analysis can proceed accordingly. As Figure 4-11 demonstrates, adding the three
highest priority cells together (HG, HA, and MG) brings a total of $891,775, which is nearly half of the
corrective action budget of $2,000,000. The agency would then move to the next tier of prioritization, or
cells HB, MA, and LG. Totaling these cells yields a total of $503,350, which combined with the previous
total from HG, HA, and MG, yields a running total of $1,395,125.




                     Figure 4-11. Corrective Action Prioritization with Costs


With $604,875 remaining in the corrective action budget, the agency would proceed with prioritization
into cells MB and LA. Totaling those two cells yields $2,619,505. Clearly, this total exceeds the
remaining corrective action budget, so stakeholders will have to decide on how to allocate the remaining
dollars. Should the stakeholders determine that corrective action impact should be the driving factor, the
corrective actions in cell LA would be implemented. Should the stakeholders determine that system
sensitivity and security control ranking are the driving factors, then selected corrective actions from cell
MB would be implemented until the remaining $604,875 is expended.

                                                      36
One benefit of this methodology is that once all corrective action dollars have been expended, the
remaining corrective actions are still prioritized according to cost and impact criteria. Therefore, they can
be addressed in order of priority during the subsequent budget cycle. Furthermore, implementing
enterprise-level corrective actions early in the process could
mitigate system-level weaknesses. For example, if an                  In some instances, agencies may find

mitigating risks.

4.5     Develop Supporting Materials

Once prioritizing against requirements is completed, operating units are poised to select their investments
for the budget year and begin the process of requesting funding from OMB for the next year to implement
the corrective actions and security controls.

4.5.1    Enterprise- and System-Level Considerations
Prioritized enterprise- and system-level corrective actions become candidates for investment. While the
supporting materials process is essentially the same for each type of investment, requirements and drivers
differ, as shown in Figure 4-12.




                     Figure 4-12. Enterprise- and System-Level Requirements

Once POA&M corrective actions are prioritized, system-level corrective actions will require system-level
documentation, while enterprise-level corrective actions will require enterprise- or infrastructure-level
documentation.

4.5.2    Concept Paper

Regardless of whether the potential investment is at the system or enterprise/infrastructure level, the
suggested budget process for new investments begins with a concept paper. The concept paper is
developed by the investment owner and submitted to the IRB for review. The concept paper provides a
                                                      37
high-level description of the proposed investment and includes a rough-order-of-magnitude costing
estimate, benefits, milestones, and agency impacts. Such papers are usually only a few pages long. Based
on the concept paper, the IRB can determine whether the investment will be a worthwhile endeavor and
recommend continuation or cancellation of the potential investment.

4.5.3    Investment Thresholds

Following approval of the concept paper, the Select phase of the investment life cycle begins. The
investment will require additional budget documentation for internal (IRB, TRB, etc.) and external
(OMB) review. The degree of formality of required documentation is commensurate with the investment
thresholds. Figure 4-13 presents sample IT security investment review thresholds for illustrative purposes
only. Each agency will have its own thresholds, depending on agency mission and overall budget.
Existence of formal investment thresholds that would trigger a more rigorous level of review are
indicative of agencies that have moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the ITIM maturity model.




                       Figure 4-13. Illustrative Project Thresholds

As Figure 4-13 demonstrates, the greater the life-cycle cost of the security investment, the more rigorous
the review process. Generally, operating units, with approval from the OCIO, use their discretion when
funding investments are below $1 million. However, for investments that are e-Gov, high profile, or over
$1 million, a full review by the operating unit, TRB, IRB, and OCIO is necessary to demonstrate that all
requirements are met and that the investment aligns with agency mission.

During this time, the investment owner must complete a series of assessments and activities to ensure
formal planning and development takes place and that all requirements are met. These activities are
detailed in Figure 4-14.

4.5.4    The Exhibit 300

As Figure 4-14 illustrates, the Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities
required for full internal (IRB, OCIO) review. More importantly, the Exhibit 300 is the document that
OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding decisions. The Exhibit 300 also provides
OMB with a robust assessment of the investment and is the vehicle for IT investments to justify life-cycle
and annual funding requests to OMB. The Exhibit 300 will:

        Provide a means for planning, budgeting, and acquiring capital assets
        Provide a technical basis and defense for investments
        Establish a clear baseline against which progress can be measured

                                                    38
           Document the planning performed for a capital investment.




                  Figure 4-14. The Investment Process, Culminating in the Exhibit 300

The Exhibit 300 is completed for new IT investments and is resubmitted annually for mixed life-cycle
and steady-state investments. Operating units should evaluate their prioritized corrective actions and
security controls identified during the prioritization process and determine whether the outputs need to be
incorporated into an existing investment’s Exhibit 300, or whether they will need to create an independent
Exhibit 300 for a new investment. For example, if a prioritized corrective action were to implement
stronger password protection on System X, then the corrective action would be included as a
supplemental budget request under System X’s Exhibit 300. However, if a prioritized corrective action
were to purchase an automated C&A tool to improve C&A across the agency, then this IT investment
would be a new investment and require a concept paper and a separate Exhibit 300 for a new acquisition.

The Alternatives Analysis section of the Exhibit 300 is a key step in making sound business decisions,
especially in the IT security arena. Every Exhibit 300 must include a minimum of three alternatives,
which should demonstrate:

       A way of meeting the mission need or providing functionality needed to accomplish mission/goals
       (e.g., sometimes a mission need can be met with a new IT system; sometimes by changing
       business processes)
       Why the selected investment provides the most effective (cost- and performance-wise) manner of
       meeting the associated mission need (versus different investments or process changes).

This section is critical for enterprise-level security investments because investment owners must
demonstrate why the selected security solutions are the most effective. The objective, quantified
prioritization process discussed in Section 4.4 links security decisions to agency goals and investment
impact, which can be used to justify alternatives.

                                                    40
Some examples of credible alternatives include:

            Status Quo. Status quo, or an explanation of the current method of meeting the mission need,
            should always be one of the alternatives. This alternative explains the limitations and/or adverse
            effects on performance associated with the current status. Presumably, an investment would be
            needed because the current way of meeting the mission need is inadequate.
            Outsourcing. This alternative will analyze and document benefits, risks, and costs of outsourcing
            the function.21
            Government-Owned and -Operated. This alternative will analyze and document benefits, risks,
            and costs of maintaining the function within and ownership of assets by the government.
            Process/Organizational Changes Only. This alternative could include a reorganization in the
            agency or division or the reengineering of a particular business process that helps an organization
            meet a mission need. This alternative will also analyze and document benefits, risks, and costs of
            restructuring processes or functions within the agency versus meeting the mission need with the
            investment.
            IT/System Only. This alternative involves investing in a system or an IT asset without any
            underlying organizational changes.

Once alternatives are selected, the input assessments and activities are completed, and the sections of the
Exhibit 300 are finalized, the operating unit’s Exhibit 300s are forwarded to the agency’s IRB for review.

4.6         IRB and Portfolio Management

The IRB reviews and selects investments based on the Exhibit 300s forwarded by operating units. Like
the prioritization that occurs at the operating unit level, the IRB typically uses strategic selection criteria
to rank-order the investment pool and usually makes decisions based on agency mission and goals, not
just on cost. Security typically is not the driving force behind portfolio management. However, it is
strategically important for the investment strategy because it serves as a qualifier for receiving funding
and as a business enabler for those functions that cannot be performed without appropriate security
controls.

After prioritizing and approving select Exhibit 300s, the IRB forms an investment portfolio request for
review by OMB.

4.7         Exhibits 53, 300, and Program Management

Following selection into the agency’s IT portfolio, Exhibit 300s are rolled into the Exhibit 53. The
Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire IT portfolio by listing every IT investment, life
cycle, and budget-year cost information. The Exhibit 53 has four sections:

       1.    IT systems by mission area
       2.    IT infrastructure and office automation
       3.    EA and planning
       4.    Grants management.

In addition to containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 also contains other IT
investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (for example, legacy systems with costs below agency
thresholds).

OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s and determines appropriate funding amounts for
the budget year based on the justification articulated in the Exhibit 300s. Agencies then receive their
budget year funding and must implement or maintain their investments throughout the year by applying
allocated funding.

For investments in the Control and Evaluate phases of the investment life cycle, project managers must
manage their investments and demonstrate progress against the baseline in the Exhibit 300 annually to
continue receiving funding.




                                                   42
5. Implementation Issues

After prioritizing IT security investments and developing Exhibit 300s and the Exhibit 53, the agency
must implement and monitor these investments. Throughout the implementation process, IT security
decisions are made based on system security issues and federal budgeting timelines.

5.1   IT Security Organizational Processes

After the IRB selects the appropriate investment mix for the IT portfolio and OMB issues funding
allocations, the IT security investments must be managed, monitored, and reported on throughout the
budget year. This IT security integration cascades throughout three organizational levels, as depicted in
Figure 5-1.




              Figure 5-1. Layers of Integration of Security into the CPIC Process

IT security integration begins at the enterprise level, where agency executives must ensure that IT security
is integrated throughout the organization. Agency security policy must be developed and supporting
procedures implemented to ensure a secure operating environment with tolerable residual risk consistent
with federal standards and legislation. This includes application of security controls commensurate with
assessment of risk.

Stemming from the organizational level, processes throughout the organization examine security posture
and compliance with mandates and legislation, including FISMA. At the process level, agencies need to
ensure that IT security weaknesses are continually identified, tracked, budgeted for, and mitigated. The
POA&M is the primary vehicle for tracking IT security weaknesses. Within the POA&M, weaknesses
and mitigation resources are identified, resolution milestones are established, and weaknesses are tracked
until mitigation.

At the project level, IT security project managers should use processes such as the POA&M, FISMA
reporting, C&A, etc., to account and budget for IT security annually and over the investment life cycle.
Business cases and Exhibit 300s should demonstrate life-cycle security costs and identify any increased
costs for newly identified weaknesses or for compliance with regulations. The process then cycles back
to the enterprise level where the OCIO, IRB, TRB, etc., evaluate Exhibit 300s annually for IT security
compliance and integration. Thus, integrating IT security into the CPIC process requires accountability,
decision making, and disciplined procedures throughout the various levels of the organization.




                                                    43
5.2       Project Management

As investments continue to move through their life cycle, it is essential that project managers continue to
examine the investment’s cost, schedule, and performance indicators. For D/M/E investments, EVM,
described in Section 2.3, can be used after the investment is selected for inclusion in the agency’s IT
portfolio to assess the investment’s cost, schedule, and performance. By examining established earned
value metrics over time, the project manager can determine whether an investment is behind schedule,
over budget, or not meeting identified performance targets. Furthermore, earned value measures used
during the Control phase of the investment life cycle enable project managers to evaluate investment
outputs versus expenditures to monitor the investment’s security cost performance as it matures. Using
the corrective action impact scores from the prioritization methodology presented in this guidance,
agencies should be able to forecast the impact that a corrective action will provide.

If an investment is late, over cost, or not meeting performance expectations, agency senior executives can
use the results of the compiled cost, benefit, and performance metrics data to determine if the investment
should:

          Continue through the investment management life cycle unchanged
          Be modified and continue
          Be canceled in its entirety.

EVM metrics and their subsequent ramifications on the decision to continue, modify, or cancel the
investment should be included in D/M/E investments’ annual Exhibit 300 to justify continued or changed
funding requests.

For steady-state or operational investments, project managers should conduct operational assessments.22
The operational assessment is a formal analysis to determine whether the investment is meeting program
objectives and the needs of the owners and users, and whether it is performing within baseline cost,
schedule, and performance goals. Operational analyses should take place in accordance with a schedule of
fixed milestones established during investment planning or on a cyclical basis. The NIST SP 800-26 self-
assessment provides a comprehensive review of an investment’s IT security controls and can be used to
analyze IT security controls for operational assessments for steady-state investments.

5.3       Legacy Systems

Even with the formal EVM and ITIM approaches, legacy systems present a unique set of challenges for
agencies. Often, agencies may rank legacy systems low from a prioritization standpoint because they:

          Include existing systems with historically low development/procurement and corrective action
          costs
          Have accepted residual risk
          Are perceived to be of a limited life span
          Are often well into the IT life cycle and typically at either the operating and maintenance or
          disposition stages.

However, if legacy systems are still able to show a direct link to agency mission, they should continue to
receive funding. Thus, security is still an important consideration for legacy systems. Typically, IT
security issues associated with legacy systems include:

          Lack of current security documentation such as security plans and risk analyses
          Insufficient management, technical, or operational controls such as those associated with
          continuity of operations planning and disaster recovery.

     Capital Programming Guide Supplement to Part 7 of OMB Circular No. A-11, “Management in Use Phase.”
                                                            44
It is imperative that agencies ensure that sufficient funds are budgeted for and that security is sufficiently
integrated into these systems commensurate with system sensitivity and risk. IT security planning and
implementation should be applied to legacy systems with the same amount of rigor and discipline as is
used on new investments.

5.4   Timelines

It is crucial for agency IT security staff to understand the timelines associated with capital plans and the
budget cycle. Even though the Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s are submitted to OMB each September, the
budgeting process is not confined to the late summer months. Planning, acquiring, and executing IT
security budgets are year-round activities. Figure 5-2 indicates prior year, current year, budget year, and
second budget year activities that occur in parallel processes.




                                       Figure 5-2. Budget Timelines

During the current year, agencies execute their budgets allocated by OMB and Congress. At the same
time, agencies evaluate prior year financial and operational performance through audits and evolutions.
In addition, while agencies are executing current year budgets, they are planning for the next budget year.
Furthermore, agencies begin considering strategies for the second budget year (BY+1) in the current year.

Determinations of current year, prior year, and budget year revolve around October 1, which is the
beginning of the government’s FY. Beginning October 1, agencies begin to execute the current year
budget. For example, on October 1, 2004, agencies would begin to execute the FY05 budget. At the
same time, agencies would evaluate their prior year (FY04) budget. Meanwhile, during October, OMB
finalizes its review of budget year (FY06) Exhibit 300s submitted by agencies in September. During
November and into December, OMB and agencies engage in pass back, whereby OMB returns weak
Exhibit 300s to agencies and suggests strategies for improvement. OMB then consolidates the investment
requests and budget submissions into a draft Presidential budget that the President receives in January.
Upon approval by the President, the budget is later submitted to the House for appropriation.


                                                      45
Figure 5-3 presents the CPIC process point of view for the IT security budgeting timelines. As illustrated
in the Figure 5-3, with multiple events of the budget process occurring within each Financial Year, it is
imperative that agencies use disciplined CPIC processes and controls to streamline activities.




                                     Figure 5-3. CPIC Timelines

Select phase activities performed in the current year are applied to the first and second budget years.
During the current year, agencies plan ahead for the two future out-years by identifying potential
investments, conducting cost/benefit analyses, developing budgets, and selecting investments to include
in the IT investment portfolio.

Control phase activities are performed during the current year as agencies execute their budgets and
implement their project controls to ensure schedule and financial milestones are achieved.

Finally, Evaluate phase activities are conducted during the current year for prior year investments to
determine whether the investments achieved their intended results.

IT security capital planning is conducted for the future, the present, and the past on a year-round basis.
Continual planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation leads to a mature CPIC process that not
only facilitates improved reporting to OMB and Congress but also leads to an increased security posture
and more efficient internal controls and processes.

Appendix A. Glossary23

           Capital planning and investment control (CPIC) – a synonym for capital programming and is a
           decision-making process for ensuring that information technology (IT) investments integrate
           strategic planning, budgeting, procurement, and the management of IT in support of agency
           missions and business needs. The term comes from the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and generally
           is used in relationship to IT management issues.
           The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 – legislation that requires agencies to use a disciplined CPIC
           process to acquire, use, maintain and dispose of information technology.
           Earned value management (EVM) – a project (investment) management tool that effectively
           integrates the investment scope of work with schedule and cost elements for optimum investment
           planning and control. The qualities and operating characteristics of EVM systems are described in
           American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standard –
           748–1998, Earned Value Management Systems, approved May 19, 1998. It was reaffirmed on
           August 28, 2002. A copy of Standard 748 is available from Global Engineering Documents (1–
           800–854–7179). Information on EVM systems is available at www.acq.osd.mil/pm.
           Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) – a framework that describes the relationship between
           business functions and the technologies and information that support them. Major IT investments
           will be aligned against each reference model within the FEA framework.
           The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) – requires agencies to integrate
           IT security into their capital planning and enterprise architecture processes at the agency, conduct
           annual IT security reviews of all programs and systems, and report the results of those reviews to
           the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
           Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) – requires federal agencies to allow
           individuals or entities that deal with the agencies the option to submit information or transact with
           the agency electronically, when practicable, and to maintain records electronically, when
           practicable. The Act specifically states that electronic records and their related electronic
           signatures are not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because they are in
           electronic form, and encourages federal government use of a range of electronic signature
           alternatives.
           IT security investment – an IT application or system that is solely devoted to security. For
           instance, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and public key infrastructure (PKI) are examples of IT
           security investments.
           Life-cycle costs – the overall estimated cost, both Government and contractor, for a particular
           program alternative over the time period corresponding to the life of the program, including direct
           and indirect initial costs plus any periodic or continuing costs of operation and maintenance.
           Major IT investment – a system or investment that requires special management attention
           because of its importance to an agency’s mission; was a major investment in the previous budget
           submission and is continuing; is for financial management and spends more than $500,000; is
           directly tied to the top two layers of the FEA (Services to Citizens and Mode of Delivery); is an
           integral part of the agency’s modernization blueprint (enterprise architecture); has significant
           program or policy implications; has high executive visibility; and is defined as major by the
           agency’s CPIC process. OMB may work with the agency to declare other investments as major
           investments. All major investments must be reported on exhibit 53. All major investments must
           submit a “Capital Asset Plan and Business Case,” Exhibit 300. Investments that are e-Government

23
     Glossary definitions are adapted from OMB Circular A-11, Part 7, Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition, and Management of
       Capital Assets, and from applicable NIST guidance.
                                                               47
in nature or use e-business technologies must be identified as major investments regardless of the
costs. If unsure about what investments to consider as "major," consult your agency budget officer
or OMB representative. Systems not considered “major” are “non-major.”
Mixed life-cycle investment – an investment that has both development/modernization/
enhancement (D/M/E) and steady-state aspects. For example, a mixed life-cycle investment could
include a prototype or module of a system that is operational with the remainder of the system in
D/M/E stages; or, a service contract for steady state on the current system with a D/M/E
requirement for system upgrade or replacement.
Privacy impact assessment – a process for examining the risks and ramifications of collecting,
maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information
system, and for identifying and evaluating protections and alternative processes to mitigate the
impact to privacy of collecting information in identifiable form. Consistent with September 26,
2003, OMB guidance (M-03-22) implementing the privacy provisions of the e-Government Act,
agencies must conduct privacy impact assessments for all new or significantly altered IT
investments administering information in identifiable form collected from or about members of the
public. Agencies may choose whether to conduct privacy impact assessments for IT investments
administering information in identifiable form collected from or about agency employees.
Risk
   o Security risk – the level of impact on agency operations (including mission functions,
     image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an
     information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat
     occurring.
   o Investment risk – risks associated with the potential inability to achieve overall program
     objectives within defined cost, schedule, and technical constraints. OMB has defined 19
     areas of investment risk, all of which are required to be addressed in the Exhibit 300.

Select-Control-Evaluate IT investment management process
   o Select – the goal of the Select phase is to assess and prioritize current and proposed IT
     projects and then create a portfolio of IT projects. In doing so, this phase helps to ensure that
     the organization (1) selects those IT projects that will best support mission needs and (2)
     identifies and analyzes a project’s risks and returns before spending a significant amount of
     project funds. A critical element of this phase is that a group of senior executives makes
     project selection and prioritization decisions based on a consistent set of decision criteria
     that compares costs, benefits, risks, and potential returns of the various IT projects.
   o Control – the Control phase consists of managing investments while monitoring for results.
     Once the IT projects have been selected, senior executives periodically assess the progress
     of the projects against their projected cost, scheduled milestones, and expected mission
     benefits.
   o Evaluate – the Evaluate phase provides a mechanism for constantly improving the
     organization’s IT investment process. The goal of this phase is to measure, analyze, and
     record results based on the data collected throughout each phase. Senior executives assess
     the degree to which each project has met its planned cost and schedule goals and has
     fulfilled its projected contribution to the organization’s mission. The primary tool in this
     phase is the post-implementation review (PIR), which should be conducted once a project
     has been completed. PIRs help senior managers assess whether a project’s proposed benefits
     were achieved and also help to refine the IT selection criteria to be used in the future.
Security controls – the management, operational, and technical controls (e.g., safeguards or
countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the system and its information.
                                              48
Steady State – an asset or part of an asset that has been delivered and is performing the mission.
