1.    Introduction


1.1   Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in furtherance
of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing
adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not
apply to national security systems. This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
Appendix III.
This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this document should be taken to
contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of
Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding
the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or any
other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide additional recommendations on the Personal Identity Verification
(PIV) Card color-coding for designating employee affiliation. Compliance with this document is voluntary;
however, a department or agency shall not claim compliance unless it adheres to all requirements of this
document. This document is not intended to contradict requirements specifically identified in the Federal
Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) or its associated documents, nor to limit options permitted by
FIPS 201 except as explicitly stated herein. The recommendations in this document complement FIPS 201 in
order to increase the reliability of PIV card visual verification.




                                                                                                                  1

2.         Color-coding for Employee Affiliation
This section provides a background color-coding scheme for Zones 15 and 12 to describe employee affiliation
using FIPS 201 color designations. It also defines additional requirements for Zones 18 and 19.

2.1        Zones 15 and 12
All letterings on the PIV card shall be printed in black except as explicitly stated herein. Figure 1 illustrates use
of Zones 15 and 12 to color-code employee affiliation.

Zone 15 shall be color-coded using one of the following colors:
       +    Blue—Foreign National
       +    White 1 —Government Employee
       +    Green—Contractor

    Note that the card body shall be white.

Foreign National color-coding has precedence over Government Employee and Contractor color-coding.
Foreign National, Government Employee, and Contractor color-coding have precedence over Emergency
Response Official color-coding (this implies that Red will never be visible in Zone 15).
The color-coding for Emergency Response Official (ERO) is optional. The ERO color-coding, when used, shall
be depicted at the footer location of Zone 12 and must print “Emergency Response Official” with white lettering
on a red background. No other color-coding is permitted in Zone 12 when implementing SP 800-104.
When Zone 15 indicates Foreign National affiliation and the department or agency does not need to highlight
ERO status, the footer location of Zone 12 may be used to denote the country or countries of citizenship. If so
used, the department or agency shall print the country name or the three letter country abbreviation (alpha-3
format) in accordance with ISO 3166-1, Country Codes [ISO 3166]. Figure 2 illustrates an example of Foreign
National color-coding using country abbreviations.

2.2        Zones 13, 14, and 16
The use of Zones 13, 14, and 16 is not restricted nor altered from [FIPS 201] in this document.

2.3        Zones 18, 19, and 20
Zone 18—Affiliation Color Code. The affiliation color code “B” for Blue or “G” for Green shall be printed in a
white circle in Zone 15. The diameter of the circle shall not be more than 5 mm. Note that the lettering shall
correspond to the printed color in Zone 15.
Zone 19—Expiration Date. The card expiration date shall be printed in a MMMYYYY format in the upper right
hand corner. The expiration date shall be printed in Arial 12pt Bold.
Zone 20—Organizational Affiliation Abbreviation. The organizational affiliation abbreviation may be printed in
the upper right hand corner below the date as shown in Figure 1. If printed, the organizational affiliation
abbreviation shall be printed in Arial 12pt Bold.

2.4        Color Representation
Table 1 provides quantitative specifications for colors in three color systems. The colors are specified in the
sRGB Tristimulus, sRGB ([IEC 61966], Color management – default RGB color space), and CMYK (Cyan,
Magenta, Yellow and Key or ‘blacK’) systems. Since the card body is white, the white color-coding is achieved
by the absence of printing. Note that [FIPS 201] requires the presence of at least one security feature which may
overlap colored or printed regions, thus modifying the perceived color. In the case of colored regions, the effect
of overlap shall not prevent the recognition of the principal color by a person with normal vision (corrected or
uncorrected) at a working distance of 50 cm to 200 cm.

                                                     Table 1. Color Representation

The colors in Table 1 can be mapped to the Pantone 2 color cue; however, note that this will not produce an exact
match. An agency or department may use the following Pantone mappings in cases where Table 1 scales are not
available.

       +    White—White
       +    Green—359C
