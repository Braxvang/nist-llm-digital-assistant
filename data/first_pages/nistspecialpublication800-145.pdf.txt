1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

Cloud computing is an evolving paradigm. The NIST definition characterizes important aspects of cloud
computing and is intended to serve as a means for broad comparisons of cloud services and deployment
strategies, and to provide a baseline for discussion from what is cloud computing to how to best use cloud
computing. The service and deployment models defined form a simple taxonomy that is not intended to
prescribe or constrain any particular method of deployment, service delivery, or business operation.

1.3   Audience

The intended audience of this document is system planners, program managers, technologists, and others
adopting cloud computing as consumers or providers of cloud services.

2.        The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that
can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment
models.

Essential Characteristics:

            On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as
                   server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human
                   interaction with each service provider.
            Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard
                   mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g.,
                   mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
            Resource pooling. The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
                   using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically
                   assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location
                   independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact
                   location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of
                   abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage,
                   processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
            Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
                   automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
                   consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can
                   be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
            Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
                   a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g.,
                   storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
                   monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
                   consumer of the utilized service.

Service Models:

            Software as a Service (SaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s
                    applications running on a cloud infrastructure 2. The applications are accessible from
                    various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g.,
                    web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the
                    underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or
                    even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-
                    specific application configuration settings.
            Platform as a Service (PaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
                    infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming

    Typically this is done on a pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis.

    A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud
    computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical
    layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes
    server, storage and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer,
    which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.


                                                                  2
                    languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.3 The consumer does
                    not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
                    operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly
                    configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
            Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision
                    processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the
                    consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating
                    systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
                    infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications;
                    and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

Deployment Models:

            Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
                    comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and
                    operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist
                    on or off premises.
            Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
                    community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission,
                    security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned,
                    managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third
                    party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
            Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be
                    owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or
                    some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
            Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
                    infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound
                    together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application
                    portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

    This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from
    other sources.
