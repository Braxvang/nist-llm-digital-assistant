1.    Introduction

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 mandated the creation of new
standards for interoperable identity credentials for physical and logical access to Federal
government locations and systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201),
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to
establish standards for identity credentials [FIPS201]. This document, Special Publication 800-
78-1, specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems and is a companion
document to FIPS 201.

1.1   Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This recommendation is
consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-
130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV:
Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-
governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this
document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding
on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this
recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary
of Commerce, Director of OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose

FIPS 201 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing,
registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also defines the structure of an
identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical
specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201
as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201 and the related Special Publications
800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-73], and SP 800-76, Biometric Data
Specification for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-76], that rely on cryptographic functions.

1.3   Scope

The scope of this recommendation encompasses the PIV Card, infrastructure components that
support issuance and management of the PIV Card, and applications that rely on the credentials
supported by the PIV Card to provide security services. The recommendation identifies
acceptable symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, and



                                                                                  Page 1
Special Publication 800-78-1                      Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


message digest algorithms, and specifies mechanisms to identify the algorithms associated with
PIV keys or digital signatures.

Algorithms and key sizes have been selected for consistency with applicable Federal standards
and to ensure adequate cryptographic strength for PIV applications. All cryptographic
algorithms employed in this specification provide at least 80 bits of security strength. For
detailed guidance on the strength of cryptographic algorithms, see [SP800-57(1)],
Recommendation on Key Management – Part 1: General.

1.4       Effective Date

Federal departments and agencies may implement these recommendations, rather than the
previous version, immediately upon publication. Federal departments and agencies must
implement these recommendations beginning January 1, 2008.

1.5       Audience and Assumptions

This document is targeted at Federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
assumed to have a working knowledge of cryptography and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
technology.

2.       Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201

FIPS 201 employs cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate cardholders, secure information
stored on the PIV Card, and secure the supporting infrastructure.

FIPS 201 and its supporting documents specify a suite of keys to be stored on the PIV Card for
personal identity verification, digital signature generation, and key management. The PIV
cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201 are:

     +    The asymmetric PIV authentication key;
     +    A card authentication key, which may be symmetric or asymmetric;
     +    An asymmetric digital signature key for signing documents and messages; and
     +    An asymmetric key management key, supporting key establishment or key transport.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used for these keys are
specified in Section 3.1. PIV Cards must implement private key computations for one or more
of the algorithms identified in this section.

Cryptographically protected objects specified in FIPS 201, SP 800-73, and SP 800-76 include:

     +    The X.509 certificates for each asymmetric key on the PIV Card;
     +    A digitally signed Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID);
     +    Digitally signed biometrics using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
          (CBEFF) signature block; and
     +    The SP 800-73 Security Object, which is a digitally signed hash table.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to protect these
objects are specified in Section 3.2. Certification Authorities (CAs) and card management
systems that protect these objects must support one or more of the cryptographic algorithms, key
sizes, and parameters specified in Section 3.2.

Applications may be designed to use any or all of the cryptographic keys and objects stored on
the PIV Card. Where maximum interoperability is required, applications should support all of
the identified algorithms, key sizes, and parameters specified in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

FIPS 201 requires CAs and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders to generate
and distribute digitally signed Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and OCSP status messages.
These revocation mechanisms support validation of the PIV Card, the PIV cardholder, the
cardholder’s digital signature key, and the cardholder’s key management key.




                                                                                   Page 3
Special Publication 800-78-1                  Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


The signed revocation mechanisms specified in FIPS 201 are:

   +   X.509 CRLs that specify the status of a group of X.509 certificates; and
   +   OCSP status response messages that specify the status of a particular X.509 certificate.
The cryptographic algorithms and key sizes, and parameters that may be used to sign these
mechanisms are specified in Section 4. Section 4 also describes rules for encoding the signatures
to ensure interoperability.

FIPS 201 permits optional card management operations. These operations may only be
performed after the PIV Card authenticates the card management system. Card management
systems are authenticated through the use of card management keys. The cryptographic
algorithms and key sizes that may be used for these keys are specified in Section 5.




                                                                                  Page 4

3.        On Card Cryptographic Requirements

FIPS 201 identifies a suite of objects that are stored on the PIV Card for use in authentication
mechanisms or in other security protocols. These objects may be divided into three classes:
cryptographic keys, signed authentication information stored on the PIV Card, and message
digests of information stored on the PIV Card. Cryptographic requirements for PIV keys are
detailed in Section 3.1. Cryptographic requirements for other stored objects are detailed in
Section 3.2.

3.1       PIV Cryptographic Keys

FIPS 201 specifies four different classes of cryptographic keys to be used as credentials by the
PIV cardholder:

      +    The mandatory PIV authentication key;
      +    An optional card authentication key;
      +    An optional digital signature key; and
      +    An optional key management key.
Table 3-1 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for each
key type. Table 3-1 also specifies time periods with different sets of acceptable algorithms for
each key type. Note that 1024 bit RSA is permitted to leverage current products and promote
efficient adoption of FIPS 201, but must be phased out by 12/31/2013 for authentication keys
and 12/31/2008 for digital signature and key management keys. Two key Triple-DES (2TDEA)
authentication keys must be phased out by 12/31/2010. These requirements anticipate that
digital signature and key management keys will be used to protect data for longer periods of
time, while data enciphered solely for authentication is usually a random challenge (rather than
sensitive information) and is generally not retained.

In addition to the key sizes, keys must be generated using secure parameters. Rivest, Shamir,
Adleman (RSA) keys must be generated using appropriate exponents, as specified in Table 3-2.
Elliptic curve keys must correspond to one of the following recommended curves from
[FIPS186-3]:

      +    Curve P-256; or
      +    Curve P-384.
To promote interoperability, this specification further limits PIV Authentication and Card
Authentication elliptic curve keys to a single curve (P-256). PIV cryptographic keys for digital
signatures and key management may use P-256 or P-384 based on application requirements.
There is no phase out date specified for either curve.




                                                                                   Page 5

This specification also restricts the size of the RSA exponent that may be associated with PIV
keys. Implementations of this specification must choose an exponent greater than or equal to
65,537. Upper bounds for the exponent are based on key length; see Table 3-2 for complete
details.

This specification requires that the key management key must be an RSA key transport key, an
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key, or an elliptic curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV)
key. The specification for RSA key transport is [PKCS1]; the specification for ECDH and
elliptic curve MQV is [SP800-56A].

3.2       Authentication Information Stored on the PIV Card

3.2.1      Specification of Digital Signatures on Authentication Information

FIPS 201 requires the use of digital signatures to protect the integrity and authenticity of
information stored on the card. FIPS 201 and SP 800-73 require digital signatures on the
following objects stored on the PIV Card:

      +    X.509 public key certificates;
      +    The CHUID;
      +    Biometric information (e.g., fingerprints); and
      +    the SP 800-73 Security Object.
Approved Digital Signature algorithms are specified in [FIPS 186-3]. Table 3-3 provides
specific requirements for digitally signed information stored on the PIV Card. The first column
specifies three time periods; the remaining columns specify public key algorithms and hash
algorithms for generating digital signatures. For signatures on the CHUID, 800-73 Security
Object, and stored biometrics, the hash algorithm that must be used to generate the signature is
determined by the signature generation date. Agencies are cautioned that generating digital
signatures with elliptic curve algorithms may initially limit interoperability.

Table 3-3 establishes a migration strategy for RSA signatures. To maximize interoperability,
RSA signatures should use the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme with SHA-1 through the end of
2009. RSA signatures using the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme with SHA-256 are permitted
through the end of 2009, but agencies should expect limited interoperability. 2010 is a transition
period where both SHA-1 and SHA-256 are recommended for generation of RSA signatures.
Beginning in 2011, only SHA-256 may be used to generate RSA signatures on PIV objects.
RSA signatures generated with SHA-256 may use either the PKCS #1 v.1.5 padding scheme or


                                                                                         Page 7
Special Publication 800-78-1                           Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


the Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS) padding as defined in [PKCS1]. (This specification
does not permit generation of RSA signatures with SHA-1 and PSS padding, since most current
implementations of RSA use the padding scheme defined in PKCS #1 v.1.5). The PSS padding
scheme OID is independent of the hash algorithm; the hash algorithm is specified as a parameter
(for details, see [PKCS1]). Implementations of this specification must use the SHA-256 hash
algorithm when generating RSA-PSS signatures. Agencies may wish to transition to the PSS
padding scheme as they transition to SHA-256.

FIPS 201, SP 800-73, and SP 800-76 specify formats for the CHUID, the Security Object, the
biometric information, and X.509 public key certificates which rely on object identifiers (OID)
to specify which signature algorithm was used to generate the digital signature. The object
identifiers specified in Table 3-4, below, must be used in FIPS 201 implementations to identify
the signature algorithm.

3.2.2   Specification of Public Keys In X.509 Certificates

FIPS 201 requires generation and storage of an X.509 certificate to correspond with each
asymmetric private key contained on the PIV Card. X.509 certificates include object identifiers
to specify the cryptographic algorithm associated with a public key. Table 3-5, below, specifies
the object identifiers that may be used in certificates to indicate the algorithm for a subject public
key.

A single object identifier is specified in Table 3-5 for all elliptic curve keys. An additional
object identifier must be supplied in a parameters field to indicate the elliptic curve associated
with the key. Table 3-6, below, identifies the named curves and associated OIDs. (RSA
exponents are encoded with the modulus in the certificate’s subject public key, so the OID is not
affected.)

3.2.3   Specification of Message Digests in the SP 800-73 Security Object

SP 800-73 mandates inclusion of a Security Object consistent with the Authenticity/Integrity
Code defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in [MRTD]. This object
contains message digests of other digital information stored on the card and is digitally signed.
This specification requires that the message digests of digital information be computed using the
same hash algorithm used in the digital signature used to sign the Security Object. The set of
acceptable algorithms depends upon the signature generation date, as specified in Table 3-3. The
Security Object format identifies the hash algorithm used when computing the message digests
by inclusion of an object identifier; the appropriate object identifiers are identified in Table 3-7.

4.       Certificate Status Information

The FIPS 201 functional component PIV Card Issuance and Management Subsystem generates
and distributes status information for PIV asymmetric keys. FIPS 201 mandates two formats for
certificate status information:

     +    X.509 CRLs; and
     +    OCSP status response messages.
The CRLs and OCSP status responses are digitally signed to support authentication and integrity
using a public key and hash algorithm at least as large as that used to sign the certificate. The
CRL or OCSP message can also be signed with a larger public key or hash algorithm that
satisfies the requirements for signing new PIV information, as specified in Table 3-3.

CRLs and OCSP messages rely on object identifiers to specify which signature algorithm was
used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers specified in Table 3-4 must be used
in CRLs and OCSP messages to identify the signature algorithm.




                                                                                  Page 10

5.     PIV Card Management Keys

PIV Cards may support card activation by the card management system to support card
personalization and post-issuance card update. PIV Cards that support card personalization and
post-issuance updates perform a challenge response protocol using a symmetric cryptographic
key (i.e., the PIV Card Management Key) to authenticate the card management system. After
successful authentication, the card management system can modify information stored the PIV
Card. Table 5-1 below, establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key
sizes for PIV Card Management keys according to the card expiration date.

6.    Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces
SP 800-73 defines an application programming interface, the End-Point Client-Application
Programming Interface, and a set of mandatory card commands, the End-Point PIV Card
Application Card Command Interface. The command syntaxes for these interfaces identify PIV
keys using one-byte key references; their associated algorithms are specified using one-byte
algorithm identifiers. The same identifiers are used in both interfaces.

Section 6.1, below, specifies the key reference values for each of the PIV key types. Section 6.2
defines algorithm identifiers for each cryptographic algorithm supported by this specification.
Section 6.3 identifies valid combinations of key reference values and algorithm identifiers based
on the period of use.

6.1   Key Reference Values

A PIV Card key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to
its PIV Key Type. Table 6-1 defines the key reference values used on the PIV interfaces.

6.2   PIV Card Algorithm Identifiers

A PIV Card algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm
and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the algorithm identifier also specifies a
mode of operation (i.e., CBC or ECB). Table 6-2 lists the algorithm identifiers for the
cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the PIV interfaces. All other algorithm
identifier values are reserved for future use.
