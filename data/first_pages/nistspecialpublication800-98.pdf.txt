Executive Summary

Like any information technology (IT), radio frequency identification (RFID) presents security and privacy
risks that must be carefully mitigated through management, operational, and technical controls in order to
realize the numerous benefits the technology has to offer. When practitioners adhere to sound security
engineering principles, RFID technology can help a wide range of organizations and individuals realize
substantial productivity gains and efficiencies. These organizations and individuals include hospitals and
patients, retailers and customers, and manufacturers and distributors throughout the supply chain. This
document provides an overview of RFID technology, the associated security and privacy risks, and
recommended practices that will enable organizations to realize productivity improvements while
safeguarding sensitive information and protecting the privacy of individuals. While RFID security is a
rapidly evolving field with a number of promising innovations expected in the coming years, these
guidelines focus on controls that are commercially available today.

RFID is a form of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology that uses electric or
magnetic fields at radio frequencies to transmit information. An RFID system can be used to identify
many types of objects, such as manufactured goods, animals, and people. Each object that needs to be
identified has a small object known as an RFID tag affixed to it or embedded within it. The tag has a
unique identifier and may optionally hold additional information about the object. Devices known as
RFID readers wirelessly communicate with the tags to identify the item connected to each tag and
possibly read or update additional information stored on the tag. This communication can occur without
optical line of sight and over greater distances than other AIDC technologies. RFID technologies support
a wide range of applications—everything from asset management and tracking to access control and
automated payment.

Every RFID system includes a radio frequency (RF) subsystem, which is composed of tags and readers.
In many RFID systems, the RF subsystem is supported by an enterprise subsystem that is composed of
middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. RFID systems that share information across
organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications, also have an inter-enterprise subsystem.
Each RFID system has different components and customizations so that it can support a particular
business process for an organization; as a result, the security risks for RFID systems and the controls
available to address them are highly varied. The enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems involve
common IT components such as servers, databases, and networks and therefore can benefit from typical
IT security controls for those components.

Implementing the recommendations presented in this publication should help organizations improve the
security of their RFID systems.

Personnel responsible for designing RFID systems should understand what type of application an
RFID system will support so that they can select the appropriate security controls.

Each type of application uses a different combination of components and has a different set of risks. For
example, protecting the information used to conduct financial transactions in an automated payment
system requires different security controls than those used for protecting the information needed to track
livestock. Factors to consider include:

 The general functional objective of the RFID technology. For example, does the system need to
  determine the location of an object or the presence of an object, authenticate a person, perform a
  financial transaction, or ensure that certain items are not separated?




                                                   ES-1
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates. One application may only
  need to have a unique, static identifier value for each tagged object, while another application may
  need to store additional information about each tagged object over time. The sensitivity of the
  information is also an important consideration.
 The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur. This includes the
  distance between the readers and the tags, and the amount of time in which each transaction must be
  performed.
 The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place. For example,
  human and environmental threats may pose risks to tags’ integrity while the tagged objects are in
  storage or in transit. Some applications require the use of tags with sensors that can track
  environmental conditions over time, such as temperature and humidity.
 The economics of the business process and RFID system. The economic factors for RFID systems
  are different than those for traditional IT systems. For example, many RFID tags offer few or no
  security features; selecting tags that incorporate basic security functionality significantly increases the
  cost of tags, especially if encryption features are needed. Also, the operational cost of some basic IT
  security controls, such as setting unique passwords and changing them regularly, may be higher for
  RFID systems because of the logistical challenges in managing security for thousands or millions of
  tags.
For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations should effectively manage their risk.

Like other technologies, RFID technology enables organizations to significantly change their business
processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This technology is complex and combines a number of
different computing and communications technologies. Both the changes to business process and the
complexity of the technology generate risk. The major risks associated with RFID systems are as
follows:

 Business process risk. Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the
  business processes the RFID system was designed to enable. For example, a warehouse that relies
  solely on RFID to track items in its inventory may not be able to process orders in a timely fashion if
  the RFID system fails.
 Business intelligence risk. An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access to
  RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the
  RFID system. For example, an adversary might use an RFID reader to determine whether a shipping
  container holds expensive electronic equipment, and then target the container for theft when it gets a
  positive reading.
 Privacy risk. Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses
  what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or
  understood. As people possess more tagged items and networked RFID readers become ever more
  prevalent, organizations may have the ability to combine and correlate data across applications to
  infer personal identity and location and build personal profiles in ways that increase the privacy risk.
 Externality risk. RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or
  collocated systems, assets, and people. For example, an adversary could gain unauthorized access to
  computers on an enterprise network through Internet Protocol (IP) enabled RFID readers if the
  readers are not designed and configured properly.

Organizations need to assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of management,
operational, and technical security controls for their environments. These organizational assessments
should take into account many factors, such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of each threat, and
cost and performance implications of the technology or operational practice.

Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning,
implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization’s privacy
officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer.

When securing an RFID system, organizations should select security controls that are compatible
with the RFID technologies they currently deploy or purchase new RFID technologies that support
the necessary controls.

To be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of
RFID systems—from policy development and design to operations and retirement. However, many
RFID products support only a fraction of the possible protection mechanisms. Tags, in particular, have
very limited computing capabilities. Most tags supporting asset management applications do not support
authentication, access control, or encryption techniques commonly found in other business IT systems.
RFID standards specify security features including passwords to protect access to certain tag commands
and memory, but the level of security offered differs across these standards. Vendors also offer
proprietary security features, including proprietary extensions to standards-based technologies, but they
are not always compatible with other components of the system. Careful planning and procurement is
necessary to ensure an organization’s RFID system meets its security objectives.

1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

These guidelines have been prepared for use by Federal agencies. They may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidance made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the risks of RFID technology and security
measures to mitigate those risks. It provides practical, real-world advice on how to initiate, design,
implement and operate RFID systems in a manner that mitigates security and privacy risks. The
document also provides background information on RFID applications, standards, and system
components to assist in the understanding of RFID security risks and controls.

This document presents information that is independent of particular hardware platforms, operating
systems, and applications. The emphasis is on RFID systems that are based on industry and international
standards, although the existence of proprietary approaches is noted when they offer relevant security
features not found in current standards. Readers are encouraged to supplement this document with vendor
publications and other materials if interested in further pursuing proprietary approaches.

Section 6 provides a brief overview of privacy laws and regulations that pertain to Federal agencies.
Privacy concerns involve legal and policy issues that are addressed more thoroughly in the documents
referenced in that section. Security and privacy concerns are not entirely separable. For instance, security
mechanisms designed to protect data confidentiality also serve privacy interests. On the other hand,
approaches to privacy protection that involve the temporary or permanent disabling of RFID technology
may introduce a security vulnerability because of the potential for these mechanisms to be used in an
unauthorized or unanticipated fashion.

This publication primarily focuses on asset management, tracking, matching, process control, and supply-
chain RFID applications. RFID technology is also used in contactless smart cards that support personal
identification, access control, and automated payment applications. While this document provides

information relevant to contactless smart card applications, it does not address the advanced
                                                                                    1
authentication and cryptography features that are incorporated into many of them.

This document has been created for executives, planners, systems analysts, security and privacy
professionals, and engineers who are responsible for Federal government business processes or
information technology (IT) systems. Professionals with similar responsibilities outside the government
should also benefit from the information this document provides. The document addresses both the needs
of those considering an RFID implementation and those with an existing RFID system. The document is
also useful for researchers, students, market analysts and others who seek an overview of RFID
technology and related security issues.

      The distinction between RFID tags and contactless smart cards is becoming more difficult to define because the computing
      resources and security functionality of RFID tags is increasing over time. RFID tags and contactless smartcards often use
      the same air interface standards and techniques for wireless communication.

2.      RFID Technology

This section provides an introduction to RFID technology. It begins with a discussion of the benefits of
RFID relative to other automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies. It then reviews the
basic components of RFID systems and provides background information needed to understand later
material in the document. Readers who already have a strong understanding of RFID technology and
applications can skip this section and the discussion in Section 3 about RFID applications.

2.1     Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) Technology

Identification processes that rely on AIDC technologies 2 are significantly more reliable and less
expensive than those that are not automated. The most common AIDC technology is bar code
technology, which uses optical scanners to read labels. 3 Most people have direct experience with bar
codes because they have seen cashiers scan items at supermarkets and retail stores. Bar codes are an
enormous improvement over ordinary text labels because personnel are no longer required to read
numbers or letters on each label or manually enter data into an IT system; they just have to scan the label.
The innovation of bar codes greatly improved the speed and accuracy of the identification process and
facilitated better management of inventory and pricing when coupled with information systems.

RFID represents a technological advancement in AIDC because it offers advantages that are not available
in other AIDC systems such as bar codes. RFID offers these advantages because it relies on radio
frequencies to transmit information rather than light, which is required for optical AIDC technologies.
The use of radio frequencies means that RFID communication can occur:

 Without optical line of sight, because radio waves can penetrate many materials,
 At greater speeds, because many tags can be read quickly, whereas optical technology often requires
  time to manually reposition objects to make their bar codes visible, and
 Over greater distances, because many radio technologies can transmit and receive signals more
  effectively than optical technology under most operating conditions.
The ability of RFID technology to communicate without optical line of sight and over greater distances
than other AIDC technology further reduces the need for human involvement in the identification process.
For example, several retail firms have pilot RFID programs to determine the contents of a shopping cart
without removing each item and placing it near a scanner, as is typical at most stores today. In this case,
the ability to scan a cart without removing its contents could speed up the checkout process, thereby
decreasing transaction costs for the retailers. This application of RFID also has the potential to
significantly decrease checkout time for consumers.

RFID products often support other features that bar codes and other AIDC technologies do not have, such
as rewritable memory, security features, and environmental sensors that enable the RFID technology to
record a history of events. The types of events that can be recorded include temperature changes, sudden
shocks, or high humidity. Today, people typically perceive the label identifying a particular object of
interest as static, but RFID technology can make this label dynamic or even “smart” by enabling the label
to acquire data about the object even when people are not present to handle it.



2
      AIDC technologies are also known as Automatic Identification Systems and Automatic Identification Technologies. The
      terms “automated” and “automatic” are often used interchangeably.
3
      Other AIDCs include smart cards, optical memory cards, contact memory buttons, and satellite tracking systems.

2.2   RFID System Components

RFID systems can be very complex, and implementations vary greatly across industries and sectors. For
purposes of discussion in this document, an RFID system is composed of up to three subsystems:

 An RF subsystem, which performs identification and related transactions using wireless
  communication,
 An enterprise subsystem, which contains computers running specialized software that can store,
  process, and analyze data acquired from RF subsystem transactions to make the data useful to a
  supported business process, and
 An inter-enterprise subsystem, which connects enterprise subsystems when information needs to be
  shared across organizational boundaries.
Every RFID system contains an RF subsystem, and most RFID systems also contain an enterprise
subsystem. An RFID system supporting a supply chain application is a common example of an RFID
system with an inter-enterprise subsystem. In a supply chain application, a tagged product is tracked
throughout its life cycle, from manufacture to final purchase, and sometimes even afterwards (e.g., to
support targeted product recalls).

The characteristics of RFID enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems are very similar to those of any
networked IT system in terms of the types of computers that reside on them, the protocols they support,
and the security issues they encounter.

Sections 2.3 through 2.5 review each of the subsystems in more detail.

2.3   RF Subsystem

To enable wireless identification, the RF subsystem consists of two components:

 RFID tags (sometimes referred to as transponders), which are small electronic devices that are
  affixed to objects or embedded in them. Each tag has a unique identifier and may also have other
  features such as memory to store additional data, environmental sensors, and security mechanisms.
 RFID readers, which are devices that wirelessly communicate with tags to identify the item
  connected to each tag and possibly associate the tagged item with related data.
Both the tag and the reader are two-way radios. Each has an antenna and is capable of modulating and
demodulating radio signals. Figure 2-1 shows a simple RF subsystem configuration.

                             Figure 2-1. An Example of a Simple RF Subsystem

Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 discuss tag and reader characteristics in more detail. Section 2.3.3 explains the
fundamentals of tag-reader communication.

2.3.1   Tag Characteristics

The market for RFID tags includes numerous different types of tags, which differ greatly in their cost,
size, performance, and security mechanisms. Even when tags are designed to comply with a particular
standard, they are often further customized to meet the requirements of specific applications.
Understanding the major tag characteristics can help those responsible for RFID systems identify the tag
characteristics required in their environments and applications. Major characteristics of tags include:

 Identifier format,
 Power source,
 Operating frequencies,
 Functionality, and
 Form factor.
Sections 2.3.1.1 through 2.3.1.5 examine these characteristics in detail.

2.3.1.1 Identifier Format

Every tag has an identifier that is used to uniquely identify it. There are a number of data formats
available for encoding identifiers on tags. System designers often want to use identifiers that have a
standard structure, with certain groups of bits representing particular fields. A tag identifier format that is
used across many industry sectors is the Electronic Product Code (EPC). This format was developed by
the industry group EPCglobal. EPCglobal is a joint venture between Global Standards One (GS1), which
was formerly known as European Article Numbering (EAN) International, and GS1 US, which was
formerly known as the Uniform Code Council (UCC). The tag identifier format consists of four data
fields:

 The Header, which specifies the EPC type,


                                                      2-3
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The EPC Manager ID, which uniquely identifies the organization that is responsible for assigning the
  object class and serial number bits (often the manufacturer of the item),
 The Object Class, which identifies a class of objects, such as a certain model of television set, and
 The Serial Number, which uniquely describes the instance of that class of objects (e.g., a particular
  television set).
Using a standard identifier format makes it easier for organizations to decode identifiers. When a
machine reads a standard identifier, it can parse the identifier and decode its fields. The machine may
need to request information from a remote computer to look up an identifier. When the database is
distributed across several organizations and many servers, a standard identifier format with specified
fields greatly facilitates the look up process. Therefore, standard identifier formats should be used
whenever an RFID system will be used across multiple organizations.

If an organization does not expect its tag identifiers to be read by external parties or is concerned that the
association of a tag with the organization or specific classes of objects is a business or privacy risk, then it
may choose to develop and implement its own identifier format that does not reveal this information.
Options include random or serialized identifiers that do not reveal information about the tagged item (e.g.,
its object class). Such identifiers can be encoded on many standards-based tags. These tags reserve
memory for standard identifier formats but the memory does not have to be used for that purpose.

The data format chosen for an RFID system should be adequate for the entire life cycle of the system.
Certain data formats may not have enough bits to uniquely encode all the tags that will be used in a
particular application. For example, a supply chain RFID system may need longer identifiers to identify
the large number of items that it will manage. The identifier data format also has security implications.
For example, standard formats such as EPC allow an adversary to quickly obtain intelligence about a
business activity by decoding the manager and object class fields. 4

2.3.1.2 Power Source

Tags need power to perform functions such as sending radio signals to a reader, storing and retrieving
data, and performing other computations (e.g., those needed for security mechanisms). Tags can obtain
this power from a battery or from electromagnetic waves emitted by readers that induce an electric current
in the tags. The power requirements of a tag depend on several factors, including the operating distance
between the tag and the reader, the radio frequency being used, and the functionality of the tag. In
general, the more complex the functions the tag supports, the greater its power requirements. For
example, tags that support cryptography or authentication require more energy than tags that are limited
to transmitting an identifier.

Tags are categorized into four types based on the power source for communication and other
functionality:

 Passive,
 Active,
 Semi-active, and
 Semi-passive.

4
    The US Department of Defense (DoD) has mitigated this risk by using a serialized single-field tag identifier. This serialized
    identifier does not reveal any information about the object with which it is associated.


                                                              2-4
                                                                                               SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



A passive tag uses the electromagnetic energy it receives from a reader’s transmission to reply to the
reader. The reply signal from a passive tag, which is also known as the backscattered signal, 5 has only a
fraction of the power of the reader’s signal. This limited power significantly restricts the operating range
of the tag. It also means that passive tags can only support data processing of limited complexity. On the
other hand, passive tags typically are cheaper, smaller, and lighter than other types of tags, which are
compelling advantages for many RFID applications.

An active tag relies on an internal battery for power. The battery is used to communicate to the reader, to
power on-board circuitry, and to perform other functions. Active tags can communicate over greater
distance than other types of tags, but they have a finite battery life and are generally larger and more
expensive. Since these tags have an internal power supply, they can respond to lower power signals than
passive tags.

A semi-active tag is an active tag that remains dormant until it receives a signal from the reader to wake
up. The tag can then use its battery to communicate with the reader. Like active tags, semi-active tags
can communicate over a longer distance than passive tags. Their main advantage relative to active tags is
that they have a longer battery life. The waking process, however, sometimes causes an unacceptable
time delay when tags pass readers very quickly or when many tags need to be read within a very short
period of time.

A semi-passive tag is a passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry, but not to produce
return signals. When the battery is used to power a sensor, they are often called sensor tags. They
typically are smaller and cheaper than active tags, but have greater functionality than passive tags because
more power is available for other purposes. Some literature uses the terms “semi-passive” and “semi-
active” interchangeably.

2.3.1.3 Operating Frequencies

The radio frequencies at which a tag transmits and receives signals have implications for:

 Tag performance characteristics, including operating range, speed of tag reads, and RFID data
  transfer rate. In general, as a tag’s operating frequency increases, its signals are able to carry more
  data. 6 As a result, higher frequency readers are also able to read more tags in a given period of time.
  In addition, RFID systems that operate at ultra high frequency (UHF) and microwave frequencies are
  typically designed to have a longer operating range than LF and high frequency (HF) systems. 7 For
  most applications, the increased speed and operating range are considered advantages. One exception
  is applications for which security or privacy is a significant concern, such as those that involve
  financial transactions or personal data. In these cases, the ability of an adversary to read the data
  more quickly and from a longer distance typically is considered a risk that requires mitigation.


5
    Passive tags that transmit ultra high frequency (UHF) or microwave signals typically rely on backscattering to communicate.
    Passive tags that transmit low frequency (LF) or high frequency (HF) signals typically are inductively coupled and do not
    communicate via backscatter.
6
    For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID technology can read tags at a speed of up to 640 kilobits per
    second. This data transfer rate can allow up to several hundred tags to be read per second.
7
    UHF and microwave RFID systems are typically designed to operate outside the near field of the electromagnetic signal –
    i.e., beyond a small number of wavelengths. This permits these systems to have a longer operating range than LF and HF
    systems, which generally operate in the near field. For example, EPCglobal UHF RFID systems have an operating range of
    up to 3 meters (m), which is significantly greater than UHF wavelengths of between 0.1 m and 1.0 m. ISO/IEC 14443 HF
    systems have an approximate range of 7 to 15 centimeters (cm), which is significantly less than the HF wavelengths of
    between 10 and 100 meters. Recent advancements in near-field UHF RFID have improved the read rate and performance
    around liquids and metals.


                                                             2-5
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The ability of the tag’s signal to penetrate materials. As a general rule, higher frequencies are less
  able to penetrate substances such as metals or liquids than lower frequencies. Depending on the
  application, the penetration capabilities of a particular frequency can be either a benefit or a
  shortcoming. For example, LF communication typically is a requirement when tags are placed inside
  an animal (or humans, in some emerging medical applications) because RF attenuation in living
  tissue, which is mostly water, increases significantly as frequency increases. In applications in which
  security is a significant concern, an organization may want to use a frequency range than can be
  blocked by a particular material because this enables effective security shielding that might not
  otherwise be available. Table 2-1 summarizes the ability of RF signals to penetrate various
  substances.
 The likelihood of radio interference. Radio interference is another reason why transmitted signals
  may not be properly received. Determining the potential sources of radio interference for a particular
  RFID implementation requires a site survey. RFID systems may experience radio interference from
  other systems that operate in the same or nearby frequency band. Interference often is exacerbated
  when using high power readers or when many readers are collocated. Table 2-2 lists potential sources
  of interference for RFID systems.
 The international portability of tags. The types of systems that use various portions of the
  electromagnetic spectrum can differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because not all regulators assign
  the same frequencies for the same purposes. If an RFID application requires transporting tags across
  multiple regulatory jurisdictions, then the system needs to use a frequency range permitted in all of
  the jurisdictions. Regulations impacting RFID often change, so organizations that use or plan to use
  RFID technology internationally should monitor relevant developments. Currently, there are
  frequencies within the LF, HF, and UHF bands that are permitted in most jurisdictions. Also, some
  tags are frequency-agile, so they can respond to one frequency in one jurisdiction and another in a
  different jurisdiction. 8




8
    For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags operate in the UHF band from 860 to 960 megahertz (MHz). In the
    United States, regulations permit operation from 902 to 928 MHz. In Europe, the typical operating range is from 865.6 to
    867.6 MHz. Some US and European readers can be tuned to corresponding permitted frequencies, but the tags will respond
    to both.

2.3.1.4 Functionality

The primary function of a tag is to provide an identifier to a reader, but many types of tags support
additional capabilities that are valuable for certain business processes. These include:

 Memory. Memory that is nonvolatile enables data to be stored on tags and retrieved at a later time.
  This memory is either write once, read many (WORM) memory or re-writeable memory, which can
  be modified after initialization. Non-volatile memory enables more flexibility in the design of RFID
  systems because RFID data transactions can occur without concurrent access to data stored in an
  enterprise subsystem. However, adding memory to a tag increases its cost and power requirements.
  Section 3 discusses RFID application requirements and provides additional information about the
  circumstances under which the use of re-writable memory would be a desirable approach. In general,
  when this document refers to memory, it is referring to non-volatile memory. In contrast, volatile
  memory, which is also used in tags, supports tag computations and does not retain data after it is
  powered down.
 Environmental sensors. The integration of environmental sensors with tags is an example of the
  benefit of local memory. The sensors can record temperature, humidity, vibration, or other
  phenomena to the tag’s memory, which can later be retrieved by a reader. The integration of sensors
  significantly increases the cost and complexity of the tags. Moreover, while many tag operations can
  be powered using the electromagnetic energy from a reader, this approach is not workable for sensors,
  which must rely on battery power. Tags integrated with sensors typically are only used with high-
  value, environmentally sensitive, or perishable objects worthy of the additional expense.
 Security functionality, such as password protection and cryptography. Tags with on-board
  memory are often coupled with security mechanisms to protect the data stored in that memory. For
  example, some tags support a lock command that, depending on its implementation, can prevent
  further modification of data in the tag’s memory or can prevent access to data in the tag’s memory.
  In some cases, the lock command is permanent and in other cases, a reader can “unlock” the memory.
  EPCglobal standards, standards developed jointly by the International Organization for
  Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and many
  proprietary tag designs support this feature. Some RFID systems support advanced cryptographic
  algorithms that enable authentication mechanisms and data confidentiality features, although these
  functions are most commonly found on RFID-based contactless smart cards and not tags used for
  item management. Some tags offer tamper protection as a physical security feature.
 Privacy protection mechanisms. EPCglobal tags support a feature called the kill command that
  permanently disables the tag from responding to subsequent commands. The primary objective of the
  kill command is to protect personal privacy. Unlike the lock command, the kill command is
  irreversible. The kill command also prevents wireless access to a tag’s identifier, in addition to any
  memory that may be on the tag. While the lock command provides security, the primary objective of
  the kill command is personal privacy. RFID tags could potentially be used to track individuals that
  carry tagged items or wear tagged articles of clothing when the tags are no longer required for their
  intended use, such as to expedite checkout or inventory. The ability to disable a tag with the kill
  command provides a mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to and illegitimate use of product
  information stored in the tag.
2.3.1.5 Form Factor

The form factor of a tag refers to its shape, size, packaging, and handling features. To a large extent, a
tag’s form factor is determined by the characteristics previously discussed, such as power source and
functionality. Some important aspects regarding a tag’s form factor include the size of the tag, the weight


                                                    2-8
                                                                                  SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



of the tag, and the method by which the tag is affixed to and removed from its associated object. Tags
typically vary in size from smaller than a postage stamp to about the size of a common document stapler.
Active tags typically are significantly larger and heavier than passive tags because they have an onboard
power supply. Tags that integrate environmental sensors are also larger and heavier than those without
this functionality. While increasing the computing functionality of a tag increases its cost and power
requirements, it may not have an impact on its form factor because the microchip on a passive tag is one
of the tag’s smallest components. On most passive tags, the largest component on the tag is its antenna.

Tags can be attached to items using an adhesive or can be embedded within the item. The primary
concern when a tag is attached to an item is how easily it might be detached, whether accidentally or
maliciously. Tags attached to items also are more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions such as
dust, debris, humidity, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. However, the vulnerability is intentional
in some cases. For example, RFID tags known as frangible tags allow users to deactivate tags by tearing
the tag’s antenna from its circuitry. Organizations can create frangible tags on-site using a printer similar
to the one shown in Figure 2-2. Tags that are embedded in objects (e.g., smart cards, animal tissue,
plastic housing) are less vulnerable to tampering and environmental conditions.

2.3.2   Reader Characteristics

The tag and the reader must comply with the same standard in order to communicate. If a tag is based on
a proprietary design, a reader must support the same communication protocol to communicate with that
tag. In many cases, if proprietary tags are used, only proprietary RFID readers from the same vendor can
be used. Reader characteristics that are independent of tag characteristics include:

 Power output and duty cycle,
 Enterprise subsystem interface,
 Mobility, and
 Antenna design and placement.
These reader characteristics are discussed in Sections 2.3.2.1 through 2.3.2.4.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.3.2.1 Power Output and Duty Cycle

In most cases, standards and regulations will determine the permitted power output and duty cycle of the
readers. A reader’s duty cycle is the percentage of time that the device is emitting energy over a specified
period. For example, a reader that communicates for 30 seconds every minute has a 50% duty cycle.
Readers that communicate with passive tags need greater power output than those that communicate with
active tags because the signal must be strong enough to reach the tag and enable the backscatter to return
to the reader. In general, readers with greater power output and duty cycles can read tags more
accurately, more quickly, and from longer distances, but the greater power output also increase the risk of
eavesdropping.

2.3.2.2 Enterprise Subsystem Interface

All readers have an RF subsystem interface to communicate with tags. Most also have a second interface
to communicate with the enterprise subsystem. The enterprise subsystem interface supports transfer of
RFID data from the reader to enterprise subsystem’s computers for processing and analysis. In most
cases, the enterprise subsystem interface is used for remote management of the readers. The interface
may be a wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi or satellite) link. Many systems use Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to monitor the readers and alert administrators of conditions that
warrant attention.

2.3.2.3 Mobility

A reader’s interface with an enterprise subsystem may be wired or wireless. Most wired readers are in
fixed locations and support applications in which the tags approach the reader. Some wired readers offer
limited mobility using cables. Figure 2-3 shows a reader portal that reads tags on a pallet of boxes
moving through the portal. Figure 2-4 shows reader antennas mounted above each toll lane in a series of
toll booths. As vehicles pass through one of the toll lanes, the reader reads a transponder that is attached
to that vehicle’s windshield.

In contrast, wireless readers support applications in which personnel must move around to read tags. 14
Figure 2-5 shows an example of a mobile handheld reader. A mobile reader usually uses different
communications protocols on its RF and enterprise subsystem interfaces, even though both interfaces are
wireless. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, also known as Wi-Fi, is a
common protocol for the enterprise subsystem interface, although it is also used for the RF interface on
some active tag implementations. The most common RF interface protocols are defined in ISO/IEC
standards, which include ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 15693, and the ISO/IEC 18000-series.

     infrastructure to the reader.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.3.2.4 Antenna Design and Placement

Readers use a wide variety of antenna types. Each type has a different coverage pattern. To reduce the
likelihood of eavesdropping and minimize interference with other radios, the coverage should only
encompass a range sufficient to communicate with the intended tags. Antennas may be integrated into the
device or may be detachable. Readers that support detachable antennas are better suited for applications
that require specific coverage areas because an antenna can be selected or customized to meet those
requirements.

Antennas can be mounted for a particular application. Figures 2-3 and 2-4 in Section 2.3.2.3 show
examples of item tracking and automatic toll payment applications. Antennas can also be mounted on
forklifts to identify items when they are moved from one location to another. In industrial applications,
antennas are often placed in tunnels around a production line’s conveyor belt.

2.3.3   Tag-Reader Communication

Tag-reader communication is achieved by using a common communications protocol between the tag and
the reader. Tag-reader communication protocols are often specified in RFID standards. Prominent
international standards include the ISO/IEC 18000 series for item management and the ISO/IEC 14443
and ISO/IEC 15693 standards for contactless smart cards. The most recent EPCglobal Class-1
Generation-2 standard is essentially equivalent to the ISO/IEC 18000-6C standard. A more detailed
explanation of RFID standards can be found in Appendix A on RFID Standards and Security
Mechanisms.

Tag-reader communication characteristics that affect performance and security include:

 How tag-reader communication is initiated,
 How a reader identifies particular tags, and
 How far away a tag or reader’s signal can be reliably detected or interpreted.
These are discussed in detail in Sections 2.3.3.1 through 2.3.3.3.

2.3.3.1 Communication Initiation

Tags and readers can initiate RF transactions in two general ways:

 Reader Talks First (RTF). In an RTF transaction, the reader broadcasts a signal that is received by
  tags in the reader’s vicinity. Those tags may then be commanded to respond to the reader and to
  continue transactions with the reader.
 Tag Talks First (TTF). In a TTF transaction, a tag communicates its presence to a reader when the
  tag is within the reader’s RF field. If the tag is passive, then it transmits as soon as it gets power from
  the reader’s signal to do so. If the tag is active, then it transmits periodically as long as its power
  supply lasts. This type of transaction might be used when it is necessary to identify objects that pass
  by a reader, such as objects on a conveyer belt.
Readers and tags in an RFID system typically operate using only RTF or only TTF transactions, not both
types. Active tag TTF operation may be easier for an adversary to detect or intercept, because active tags
send beaconing signals even when they are not in the presence of a reader. The adversary could eavesdrop
on this communication without risking detection because in TTF transactions the adversary never has to
send a signal to ascertain the tag’s presence.


                                                    2-12
                                                                                               SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



2.3.3.2 Singulation

Singulation is the process by which a reader identifies a particular tag. This capability is critical
whenever multiple tags are in close proximity. For instance, when a reader issues a command to modify a
tag’s memory, neighboring tags should not accidentally execute the same command. Similarly, when a
reader sends a query to a tag, the reader should not receive a response from multiple tags.

In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, the singulation protocol requires the reader to broadcast
commands to all tags within its operating range. By issuing additional commands, the reader may limit
interrogation to tags with specific memory contents. Tags respond with a random number. Once the
reader acknowledges this number, verifying that no tag collision has occurred, the tag will transmit its
unique ID to the reader. The reader may then request another random number that it uses to address the
tag in subsequent communication. The random number has significantly fewer bits than the tag’s
identifier, which simplifies the processing of later transactions and prevents transmission of the unique
identifier by the reader.

Some RFID technologies do not support singulation. For example, ISO 11784/11785 animal tracking
tags have no collision detection or avoidance mechanism because multiple tags are not usually read in
close proximity for this type of application.

2.3.3.3 Signal Propagation Distance

The communications link between a tag and a reader typically is bi-directional. The reader transmits a
signal to a tag over the forward channel. The tag responds on the back channel, which is also called the
reverse channel or backscatter channel. When RFID systems use passive tags, signals on the forward
channel typically are much more powerful than those on the back channel. Therefore, signals on the
forward channel can be detected or properly received over longer distances. This difference has
important implications for RFID communications security, including both the vulnerability of RF
subsystem traffic and the mechanisms used to protect it. Some relevant operational ranges related to
various communications objectives are: 15

 Nominal operating range, which is the distance, often specified by standard, over which authorized
  transactions are expected to occur;
 Back channel eavesdropping range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can reliably
  interpret a tag’s response to a legitimate reader;
 Rogue skimming (or scanning) range, which is the distance over which a rogue reader operating
  above regulated power limits can reliably communicate with a tag;
 Rogue command range, which is the distance over which a rogue reader can execute a tag command
  that does not require the reader to successfully receive information from the tag;
 Forward channel eavesdropping range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can
  reliably listen to the transmissions of an authorized reader; and
 Forward channel traffic analysis range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can
  detect the presence of a reader’s signal without having to reliably interpret its content.

                                                            2-13
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Eavesdropping ranges can be significantly greater than the nominal operating ranges listed in product
literature. For example, ISO/IEC 14443 tags have a typical operating range that is usually between 7 and
15 centimeters. 16 However, security researchers have used a portable, low-power device to demonstrate
that the rogue scanning range of an ISO/IEC 14443 contactless smart card is at least 25 centimeters
(cm). 17 Researchers have also successfully eavesdropped on ISO/IEC 14443 communications from
distances up to 15 meters using fixed antennas and receivers that were tuned to the frequency of
interest. 18

If the potential adversary does not need a reply from a passive tag to achieve its objective, then the
adversary can be much farther away. For instance, for many tags, a reader does not need to receive a
message from the tag before writing to the tag’s memory. This attack is not possible for certain
commands in EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags, because mandatory cover-coding requires the reader
to receive a key from the tag before issuing a command. 19 Cover-coding is a technique used to obscure
the content of messages from readers to tags and is described in more detail in Section 5.3.2.1.

Similarly, an adversary can be farther away if that adversary obtains information from the mere detection
of the signal, even if the signal is too weak to reliably decode. The presence of a signal indicates that
RFID activity is occurring, which an adversary could use to infer that a shipment has arrived. An
adversary may also be able to determine the number of transactions taking place even if that adversary
cannot identify the nature of those transactions, but this nonetheless could be used infer the level of
business activity. This type of intelligence gathering is called traffic analysis, and it can be performed
over much greater distances than eavesdropping.

2.4     Enterprise Subsystem

The enterprise subsystem connects readers to computers running software that can store, process, and
analyze data acquired from RF subsystem transactions to make the data useful to a supported business
process. For example, an RFID system in a retail clothing store has an RF subsystem that can read the
identifier associated with each tagged garment. The enterprise subsystem matches the identifier to the
garment’s record in a database to determine its price and the number of other items of a similar type that
remain in inventory. Some simple RFID systems consist of an RF subsystem only (e.g., RFID-based key
systems in which a reader can make an access control decision without access to other computers).
However, most RFID systems have both an RF subsystem and an enterprise subsystem.

The enterprise subsystem consists of three major components, which are shown in Figure 2-6, and
described in Sections 2.4.1 through 2.4.3:

 Middleware,
 Analytic systems, and
 Network infrastructure.

      The affected commands are kill, which disables all subsequent tag commands; write, which is used to write information to a
      tag’s memory; and access, which is necessary to lock memory. The technique, in effect, makes the rogue command range
      equivalent to the back channel eavesdropping range, thereby significantly reducing the threat of rogue commands.

2.4.1   Middleware

RFID middleware is responsible for preparing data collected from readers in the RF subsystem for the
analytic systems that directly support business processes. Middleware hides the complexity and
implementation details of the RF subsystem from the analytic systems. This allows the developers and
users of the analytic systems to focus on the business implications of RFID data rather than the intricacies
of wireless communication. For example, middleware filters duplicate, incomplete, and erroneous
information it receives from readers. Middleware filtering is especially useful for applications in which
large numbers of tags are in close proximity and for challenging RF environments, such as those
containing reflective materials. The middleware can immediately transfer the filtered data to the analytic
systems or aggregate and store it for later retrieval.

System administrators also use middleware to monitor and manage readers. For example, system
administrators use middleware to adjust the power output and duty cycle to reduce the number of
transaction errors. Many middleware products also support event-based triggers that perform actions
automatically under certain conditions. Middleware transaction logs help with the identification of
anomalous behavior, which could help an organization detect unauthorized use of the RFID system.
Many middleware products also provide additional features, such as support for printing RFID labels that
provide benefits beyond data and device management.

2.4.2   Analytic Systems

Analytic systems are composed of databases, data processing applications, and Web servers that process
the data outputs of middleware based on business requirements and user instructions. They contain
customized business logic for each business process they support. For example, the analytic systems of
an RFID system supporting logistics may include customized rules for automated inventory management,
procurement, shipping, receiving, and billing.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Analytic systems are often enterprise applications that draw inputs from multiple sources, many of which
may not involve the RF subsystem. For example, some RFID systems are designed to co-exist with or
complement existing AIDC systems (e.g., bar code technology). Analytic systems also correlate RFID
data with non-RFID business records imported from other databases, such as records from business
partners, customers, logistics service providers, and suppliers. Therefore, analytic systems are often
based on commercial database software or legacy applications 20 that support processing of data other than
RFID data. Analytic systems that are a part of the EPCglobal Network and process data based on tags that
comply with EPCglobal standards are called EPC Information Services (EPCIS).

2.4.3     Network Infrastructure

Network infrastructure enables communication between the RF and enterprise subsystems, as well as
among components of the enterprise subsystem. Some important characteristics of network infrastructure
include:

 The physical and logical topology of the network, and
 Data communications protocols.
2.4.3.1 Physical and Logical Topology

The topology of a network describes how network computing elements are physically and logically
connected to each other. Physical topology describes the network’s cable plant or air interfaces. Logical
topology describes how the communications links between devices are arranged. Network
communications devices often are configured so that the logical topology is different than the physical
topology. For example, communications equipment can be configured to create virtual private networks
(VPN) that logically combine and segment physical networks to achieve performance and security
objectives.

The physical topology of a network infrastructure supporting an RFID system depends on the physical
location of the components in its enterprise subsystem. For example, the RF to enterprise subsystem
connections are physically located near readers.

The appropriate physical location of middleware servers depends on the level of traffic generated by the
readers. If RFID transactions are relatively infrequent (e.g., an access control system with relatively
small numbers of users), then the location of middleware is not critical. In this context, the middleware
can be placed in a central location to serve multiple readers. If the business process requires large
numbers of tags to be read quickly (e.g., multiple checkout stations in a busy store), then middleware is
located near the readers to avoid latency problems and data throughput restrictions associated with many
wide area networks. In some cases, middleware capabilities are incorporated into the communication
switches to which the readers connect, so RFID-related traffic does not need to traverse even a single
device before it is filtered and processed. This configuration is often termed an edge processing network
because the switches are considered at the network’s edges.

The physical location of analytic systems usually depends on how an organization manages its enterprise
applications. If the analytic systems are dedicated to the RFID application, then organizations often place
these systems near readers and middleware. On the other hand, some organizations locate their analytic
systems in remote data centers to take advantage of the centers’ physical security, on-site technical

20
     In this context, legacy applications are computer applications that significantly predate the RFID system and are not
     designed to process data in formats that middleware supports. In this situation, data has to be converted into a format that
     the legacy application can interpret.


                                                               2-16
                                                                                              SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



personnel, and business continuity infrastructure (e.g., electric generators, enterprise data backup, high-
availability communications equipment). If the analytic systems integrate both RFID and non-RFID
information systems, then it is unlikely that the location of the RF subsystem will significantly influence
the location of the analytic systems.

When the enterprise subsystem components are distributed across an organization’s network, the resulting
physical topology can be complex, but depending on the network’s configuration, the logical topology
might be relatively simple. Many organizations create virtual local area networks (VLAN) for the
distributed enterprise subsystem devices that make them appear to each other as if they were on the same
network segment. VLANs reduce latency that causes performance problems on networks with large
numbers of time-sensitive transactions. They also isolate traffic from other systems, which improves
security.

2.4.3.2 Data Communications Protocols

Data communications protocols are a critical component of a network’s performance, reliability, and
security. A complete discussion of data communications protocols is beyond the scope of this guide, but
readers should be able to distinguish between link-layer and network-layer protocols to understand how
RFID enterprise subsystem network infrastructures work and are secured. Link-layer protocols specify
how devices communicate with each other over a common medium, or link. Network-layer protocols
(sometimes called internetwork protocols) describe how data traffic is routed across multiple network
links, possibly over many types of media.

The most common link-layer protocol connecting RFID enterprise subsystem components is Ethernet
(IEEE 802.3), which is the same link-layer protocol used to connect most office computers to local wired
networks. Ethernet has no built-in security functionality, which means other complementary data
communications protocols must provide any required protection.

In most RFID implementations, data communication within the enterprise subsystem is wired
communication. The exception is mobile readers, which connect to the enterprise subsystem using a
wireless link-layer protocol, such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11). 21 Wi-Fi’s characteristics are significantly
different than the link-layer protocols supporting communication between tags and readers. In particular,
Wi-Fi equipment supporting Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) includes numerous security features, such as
strong authentication and encryption. 22

The most common network-layer protocol for enterprise subsystem communication is the IP. Since most
modern computers are IP-enabled, enterprise subsystem components, such as middleware and analytic
systems, can easily communicate across the enterprise and over external networks, including the Internet.
The ability to communicate with a diverse range of computers and their application services also
represents a security risk. IP-enabled enterprise subsystem components are subject to the same protocol
attacks as any other IP-enabled computer.

2.5     Inter-Enterprise Subsystem

The inter-enterprise subsystem connects enterprise subsystems together when information needs to be
shared across geographic or organizational boundaries, such as in a supply chain application. Not all
RFID systems contain inter-enterprise subsystems. The largest government inter-enterprise subsystem is

21
      IEEE 802.11 is also used for communication between readers and some types of active tags.

currently the US Department of Defense’s (DoD) Global Transportation Network. The DoD improves its
logistics and operational efficiency by tracking DoD assets and personnel from their origin to their
destination.

While many potential methods for building inter-enterprise subsystems exist, EPCglobal’s inter-enterprise
approach is a standards-based architecture that has broad industry support and publicly available
documentation for review. This section focuses on EPCglobal’s approach to the inter-enterprise
subsystem for illustrative purposes, but the basic functional requirements described in the discussion of
the EPCglobal standards would also apply to any alternative inter-enterprise subsystem architecture.

2.5.1   Open System Networks

RFID systems with inter-enterprise subsystems are called open or online systems because multiple entities
have the ability to access tag-related information. In contrast, RFID systems that operate entirely within
an enterprise, and thus have no inter-enterprise subsystem, are called closed or offline systems. EPCglobal
is developing standards for an open infrastructure that will share data associated with EPCs over the
Internet among participating organizations that agree to share such data.

To create an open system, each participating organization grants partner organizations access to its
analytic systems. The access can occur over a network dedicated for this purpose, a public network such
as the Internet, or a VPN that emulates the characteristics of a dedicated network using the infrastructure
of a public or shared network. Both dedicated networks and VPNs are sometimes called extranets, to
denote that information is shared outside the enterprise, as opposed to intranets, which are restricted to
internal users. To enable extranet access, the implementing organization likely modifies its network
firewall to permit RFID-related traffic to traverse the enterprise network boundary and also creates access
privileges for external users on the analytic systems themselves. Companies typically sign agreements or
memoranda of understanding that describe the roles and responsibilities associated with the access before
enabling it.

Figure 2-7 shows how various EPCIS might be connected in an open system network.

2.5.2   Object Naming Service (ONS)

Finding information about a tagged object in an open system is a challenge because the information could
be located in any one of a number of analytic systems. To solve this problem, EPCglobal created the
Object Naming Service (ONS), which is a global distributed database of EPC tag identifiers. Users query
the ONS with a particular EPC, and the ONS returns the address information from the EPCIS that
contains information associated with that EPC. The user then queries the EPCIS directly to obtain the
desired data. The ONS is a resolution mechanism that directs an EPC query to where information
associated with that EPC can be found on the network. In order to do that, the ONS utilizes two tiers of
resolution services coordinated with the segments on the EPC string: the Root ONS and the Local ONS.

 The Root ONS is a community service administered by EPCglobal that provides an authoritative
  lookup service indexing all EPC Managers with the addresses of their Local ONS.




                                                  2-19
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The Local ONS is a software component maintained and operated locally by EPCglobal Network
  members. The Local ONS provides the authoritative database in which all EPCs issued by a specific
  EPC Manager are indexed with the addresses of their EPCIS location.
When a member of the EPCglobal Network queries the network for information about an EPC, the Root
ONS utilizes the EPC Manager Number segment to direct the EPC query to the EPC’s data owner (i.e. the
EPC Manager). From there, the EPC Manager’s Local ONS utilizes the object class segment to direct the
query to the EPCIS that stores information for that EPC.

The ONS extends the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) to support resolution of an EPC with its
corresponding EPCIS. ONS EPC resolution works similarly to the name resolution that Internet users
employ whenever visiting Web sites or sending e-mail messages, but with some significant differences,
which are presented in Table 2-3.

Much like the DNS, the Root ONS is accessible by any Internet user. Some organizations may choose to
implement their own Local ONS that is not connected to the EPCglobal Root ONS. Using an
independent ONS limits the applications and users that can access it. This characteristic is a beneficial
feature for organizations that require their EPCs to remain confidential, but is overly restrictive for
organizations that expect large numbers of external users or that cannot anticipate a priori who will have
a legitimate need for the EPC records (e.g., individual retail consumers seeking support after purchase of
a tagged object).

2.5.3    Discovery Service

The EPCglobal Discovery Services are still in the early phases of development and use cases are still
being developed to better understand the needs and requirements for this service. The concept of the
EPCglobal Discovery Services is similar to ONS in that it is envisioned to return network addresses
where data related to an EPC can be found. However, the Root ONS only provides information regarding
where a particular tag was commissioned. It does not provide information regarding the history of a
particular tag’s transactions. Multiple entities along the supply chain would benefit from having quick
access to this information that ONS does not offer. Discovery services offer a potential mechanism to
make this information available over an inter-enterprise subsystem.

The EPCglobal Discovery Services can be viewed as a search engine that provides a means to locate the
network addresses of all EPCIS services that may have information about a specific EPC (not just the
EPCIS service of the EPC Manager). For instance, it is envisioned that the EPCglobal Discovery
Services will ultimately return multiple pointers from the multiple organizations that have collected
information about the tagged object at some point in the object’s life cycle. In addition, the EPCglobal
Discovery Services may provide a cache for selected EPCIS data and may enforce authorization policies
with respect to access of the aforementioned data. It is envisioned that more than one EPCglobal
Discovery Service may operate in parallel, and may compete against each other and/or cater to particular
audiences with specific information requirements.

2.6     Summary

RFID is an innovation in AIDC technology that provides significant advantages over earlier technology,
such as optical scanning of bar codes. These advantages include the ability to identify objects without
optical line of sight over significant distances and the ability to work reliably both indoors and outdoors.

The components of an RFID system can be categorized into three subsystems:

 The RF subsystem,
 The enterprise subsystem, and
 The inter-enterprise subsystem.
Every RFID system includes an RF subsystem, which is composed of (1) tags attached to or embedded in
objects and (2) readers that query the tags. Important characteristics of tags include their identifier
format, the source of their power, the radio frequencies over which they operate, their size and shape, and
additional functionality they support, such as security features and connections to environmental sensors.
Important characteristics of readers include their power output, duty cycle, antenna design, and interface
to the enterprise subsystem, which can be either wireless or wired. A wireless enterprise interface enables
the reader to be mobile. Important aspects of tag-reader communication include the singulation protocol,
the encoding scheme, and the distance over which tag and reader signals can be reliably received.



                                                    2-21
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



In many RFID systems, the tags and readers are supported by an enterprise system that is composed of
middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. The middleware filters data, aggregates data, and
manages readers and other RFID devices. Analytic systems process and store this information to support
business processes. Lastly, the networking services are used to provide the connections among the
components of enterprise subsystem and between the enterprise subsystem and the RF subsystem.

RFID systems that share information across organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications,
also have an inter-enterprise subsystem. The RF, enterprise, and inter-enterprise subsystems together
allow an RFID system to support business processes. The versatile components of these subsystems
allow an RFID system to be tailored to the needs of a particular application. If an inter-enterprise
subsystem is constructed to EPCglobal specifications, then it will have a local ONS and an EPCIS, and
may utilize the EPCglobal Root ONS and Discovery Services. The Root ONS provides an authoritative
lookup for an EPC identifier that returns pointers to the resources from the organization that created that
identifier. Finally, EPCglobal Discovery Services are envisioned to serve as a type of search engine for
an EPC identifier that can return pointers to multiple organizations that have information related to that
EPC identifier (e.g., companies in the supply chain that have completed a transaction with a particular tag
and registered information related to its EPC in their EPCIS).

3.    RFID Applications and Application Requirements

RFID technologies are being deployed by many organizations because they have the potential to improve
mission performance and reduce operational costs. To achieve these goals, RFID systems must be
engineered to support the specific business processes that the organization is automating. Applications
for RFID technologies are diverse because of the wide range of business processes that exist.

RFID security risks and the controls available to mitigate them are also highly varied. Typically, only a
subset of the full range of technologies, risks, and controls is applicable to any given RFID
implementation. Important business drivers that shape RFID application requirements and the resulting
characteristics of RFID systems include:

 The general functional objective of the RFID technology (i.e., the application type),
 The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates,
 The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur,
 The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place, and
 The economics of the business process and RFID system.
This section discusses each of these characteristics in greater detail and provides an overview of common
types of RFID applications.

3.1   RFID Application Types

There are many types of RFID applications, of which some of the most common are asset management,
asset tracking, automated payment, and supply chain management. The key characteristic differentiating
one RFID application from another is the purpose of identifying the tagged items. Table 3-1 lists reasons
why an organization might want to identify an item and the general application type that best corresponds
to those reasons.

                                       Table 3-1. RFID Application Types

                          Purpose of Identification                          Application Type
         Determine the presence of an item                            Asset management
         Determine the location of an item                            Tracking
         Determine the source of an item                              Authenticity verification
         Ensure affiliated items are not separated                    Matching
         Correlate information with the item for decision-making      Process control
         Authenticate a person (holding a tagged item)                Access control
         Conduct a financial transaction                              Automated payment


Application types are not mutually exclusive; an implementation can combine elements of several
application types. For example, both access control systems and sophisticated asset management systems
include tracking features. Supply chain management is a tracking application that spans organizational
boundaries and often includes process control and payment transactions.

Personnel responsible for designing and implementing RFID systems should understand what application
types apply to their implementation so that they can select appropriate security controls. For example, the


                                                         3-1
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



security controls needed to protect financial transactions in automated payment systems are different than
those needed for tracking applications. The personnel should also understand that an adversary may
leverage RFID technology for an unintended purpose. For example, a warehouse may use RFID
technology to determine what items it has in its current inventory, but an adversary may use the same
system to track an item’s whereabouts after it leaves the warehouse. In this case, an asset management
system is later used to enable an unauthorized tracking application, perhaps used by an adversary to locate
high value targets.

The remainder of Section 3.1 examines each of the application types mentioned in Table 3-1, as well as
supply chain management. The section uses hypothetical examples to illustrate the key characteristics of
each application type and highlights how they differ from one another. The section also incorporates
other examples of each application to provide additional information on current and potential applications
of the technology.

3.1.1    Asset Management

RFID-based asset management systems are used to manage inventory of any item that can be tagged.
Asset management systems using RFID technology offer significant advantages over paper-based or bar
code systems, including the ability to read the identifiers of multiple items nearly simultaneously without
optical line of sight or physical contact. These features increase the speed of common asset management
tasks, which improves operational efficiency and effectiveness.

Perhaps the simplest form of asset management is Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS), which accounts
for items in retail stores. 23 For example, EAS tags are placed on electronic equipment, clothing, books,
and many other consumer goods at major retailers. After a customer purchases an item, the sales clerk
deactivates the tag. If a person attempts to leave the shop with unpurchased goods, readers at the doors
will detect the activated tag and trigger an alarm. In this case, the RFID technology determines only one
thing: whether or not the EAS tag is still operating, indicating that the item has not been properly checked
out.

Most RFID-based asset management systems provide additional functionality. For example, at a doctor’s
office, the medical records clerk can quickly scan the filing system on a monthly or quarterly basis to
determine how many medical records are present or missing. The records clerk can also instantly
compare the list of missing records with a list of those known to be checked out of the filing system.
Without RFID technology, this task could take hours or days to complete by hand. Bar code technology,
such as that found at a supermarket, would require physical handling of each medical record, which is
labor-intensive.

RFID is also an enabling technology for smart shelves and smart cabinets, which automatically maintain
continuous inventories of the items they hold by tracking items entering and leaving. Items are reordered
automatically when inventory is low. The smart shelves and cabinets can also be used for theft
prevention, alerting personnel when many high-value items are taken at the same time, and perhaps
activating a camera to record the event.

3.1.2    Tracking

Tracking applications are used to identify the location of an item, or more accurately, the location of the

part of an asset management system. One difference between relatively simple asset management
systems and tracking systems is that an asset management system can detect the presence of an item with
readers at a single location. In contrast, tracking systems require more than one reader, as well as a
network, so that a central system can aggregate and correlate information received from each of the
readers.

At transportation hubs (such as ports or train stations), readers are placed throughout the facility. The
security staff can track the location of its employees wearing RFID-equipped identification badges as they
pass through doors or gates. In addition to restricting access to specific areas of the facility, these RFID-
enabled identification badges help the security department locate specific staff members during
emergency situations and to monitor building evacuations during fire alarms.

Tracking applications can also be used to measure sports performance. Some companies sell systems to
track athletes during races. This application requires each racer to wear a unique tag that is registered
with the tracking system. Such systems can be used for any mass start event, including bicycling,
running, or triathlons. Different events may require the athletes to wear the tags in a certain way to be
detected by the system. For example, runners may be required to put the tag in one of their shoes or
cyclists may be required to mount the tag on their bicycles.

3.1.3    Authenticity Verification

In authenticity verification applications, the tag provides evidence of the source of a tagged item.
Authenticity verification often is incorporated into a tracking application. The originating source of the
tag creates a record of the initialization transaction, either on the tag or in an enterprise subsystem
database. When readers subsequently query the tag, they can determine if it originated from a proper
source. For authenticity verification systems to provide appropriate levels of assurance, they typically
need to incorporate cryptography and mechanisms to prevent cloning. 24 Digital signatures use
cryptography to provide the property of non-repudiation, which means the signatory cannot later deny
creating the signature. 25 Authenticity verification applications can use digital signatures to establish
evidence of authenticity and enable later verification. The pharmaceutical industry is using RFID for
authenticity verification to reduce the prevalence of counterfeit drugs.

3.1.4    Matching

In a matching application, two tagged items are matched with each other and a signal (e.g., a light or
tone) is triggered if one of the items is later matched with an incorrect tagged item. The most common
matching application today occurs in hospitals and involves placing bracelets with tags on mothers and
their newborn babies. If a new mother is accidentally given another woman’s infant, the system issues an
alert. Similar technology allows day care centers to match children to parents or guardians, and hospital
patients to their medicines and designated visitors. In the future, RFID tags might match airline
passengers with their checked luggage to prevent theft and inadvertent mistakes.

3.1.5    Process Control

Process control applications allow business processes to use information associated with a tag (or the
item attached to the tag) to take a customized action. A common process control application is the
facilitation of product design variations in manufacturing processes. For example, a tag might be affixed
to the frame of a product on an assembly line in a manufacturing plant. The tag’s identifier would be
24

     modifiable identifiers.

     Section 5.3.1.3 contains additional information on digital signatures.


                                                             3-3
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



associated with desired features of the finished product. At each station in the assembly process, a reader
would read the tag and take an appropriate action, such as adding a specialized component or using a
particular color of paint. In another typical application, sensors are attached to tags to measure factors
such as temperature, humidity, or shock. Information from the sensors can be used to make decisions
regarding the tagged items. For example, a perishable product may be discarded if it has been exposed to
room temperature for more than a threshold period of time.

In asset management, tracking, and matching applications, each reader only needed to capture the tag’s
identifier (a number permanently assigned to the tag) and apply a timestamp to the transaction. In process
control applications, additional information beyond the tag’s identifier is normally associated with each
tag. That information could reside on the tag itself or in a networked database. In either case, the
additional information introduces a level of complexity not found in the previously discussed
applications. Implementing organizations have additional design issues to consider, such as exactly what
information needs to be recorded, where it should be stored, how it should be protected, and their
customers’ expectation of privacy for that information.

3.1.6    Access Control

Access control systems use RFID to automatically check if an individual is authorized to physically access
a facility (e.g., a gated campus or a specific building) or logically access an information technology
system. Some systems are implemented using contactless RFID smart cards instead of mechanical keys.
Every individual that is given access to specific areas must carry one of these cards. Locked doors or
turnstiles typically protect the areas. To unlock them, authorized personnel must present their smart cards
near the appropriate reader. 26 The door or turnstile will unlock once the reader has authenticated the
smart card. The system can be configured such that only certain cards can be used to unlock certain doors
or turnstiles. The possession of the cards may also be combined with a password, personal identification
number (PIN), or biometric (e.g., fingerprint or retina scan) for additional security.

There are two general types of access control systems: online and offline. Online systems have readers
that are networked to a central computer. In an online system, each card is linked to a specific person.
Each reader is supplied by the central computer with a list of individuals that can access the
corresponding area. Since this system is networked, the central computer can provide updated access lists
to the readers. In contrast, offline systems are not networked. In offline systems, the card lists the rooms
that the holder can access, perhaps also listing an expiration date. When someone attempts to access a
room using the card, the reader checks that the card contains one of the permitted identifiers before
allowing entry.

RFID technology is also used in automobile key applications, which is effectively a type of access
control. There are two basic types: immobilizers and push-button keyless start. With immobilizers, a tag
is embedded into a key similar to a traditional vehicle key; the tag in the key is read by a reader in the
dashboard or steering column. For the key to start the vehicle, it must both have the right shape for the
ignition system and contain the tag. Duplication of these keys is significantly more difficult and costly
than traditional keys, which has helped to reduce vehicle thefts. The second automobile key application
type is push-button keyless start, which allows a driver to start a vehicle without putting a physical key in
the ignition. Instead, each driver simply carries a key fob into the vehicle. Once the key fob is detected,
the vehicle is started by pushing a start button on the dashboard.



26
     Different standards for contactless smart cards have different read distances. For example, ISO/IEC 14443 proximity smart
     cards have an approximate operating range of between 7 and 15 centimeters and ISO/IEC 15693 vicinity smart cards have
     an approximate range of up to one meter.


                                                             3-4

3.1.7    Automated Payment 27

RFID technology automates a variety of financial transactions, including fare collection on public transit
systems, 28 toll collection on roads, fuel charges at gas station pumps, and retail payment using credit
cards with embedded RFID tags. The US General Services Administration (GSA) Smart Card Program
provides RFID-based cards that support financial transactions. 29 The main advantages over other
payment forms are speed and convenience; RFID-based automated payment systems do not require users
to physically exchange cash or cards with clerks or machines.

Automated payment systems are a specialized form of access control in which access is granted to credit
or debit a financial account. Like other access control systems, they require additional security
protections to prevent fraud and abuse. In the case of automated payment, integrity and confidentiality
controls are needed as well as protection against duplicating or modifying tags; users should not be able
to alter debit and credit amounts, and bystanders should not be able to record account numbers or other
transaction details. For these reasons, the protocols and cryptography that support automated payment
systems typically are considerably more complex than those that support physical access control systems.

Automated payment systems can be online or offline. Online systems, which are the most common, store
and process the financial data in a central system networked with the readers. Offline systems require the
smart card to store “electronic cash” and handle debit and credit transactions, which involve more
sophisticated computing and increase the cost of each card. One advantage of offline systems is that they
can support the same user anonymity achieved with cash, while centralized systems must link users to
their accounts. However, because most users do not demand complete anonymity, the additional
complexity and expense of offline systems make them relatively uncommon.

One example of an automated payment system is currently being used by large resorts and cruise ships.
Guests are issued RFID-enabled identification cards upon check-in. These cards are linked to credit card
accounts and enable passengers to pay for meals and gift shop items. They are also used for identification
when guests disembark the ship or leave the resort grounds.

3.1.8    Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management involves the monitoring and control of products from manufacture to
distribution to retail sale. Supply chain management typically bundles several application types,
including asset management, tracking, process control, and payment systems. An important
distinguishing feature of supply chain management systems is that they span multiple organizations, each
of which uses RFID technology that interoperates with the others. When a system is not under one
organization’s control, it is referred to as an open system. The previously discussed systems are closed
systems because a single organization manages them. 30 Open systems are inherently more vulnerable
than closed systems because the network, application and operational interfaces between organizations
provide an adversary with more potential avenues to attack the system.



27
     This document does not describe or discuss in detail the multi-layered security controls required for RFID-based automated
     payment systems. Automated payment systems, point-of-sale systems, and financial transaction systems typically have
     complex security systems with a variety of controls and safeguards.

     Another common term is a closed loop system, which refers to RFID systems that recycle their tags for reuse. Open loop
     systems could refer to RFID systems that use disposable tags, which is the case in most supply chains.


                                                             3-5
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Supply chain systems can record information about products at every stage in the supply chain. Ideally,
tags are affixed to products during the manufacturing process or soon afterward. As a product moves
through the supply chain, to the end customer, and later to post-sale service, the tag’s identifier can be
used by all supply chain participants to refer to a specific item. In addition, supply chain systems that use
active tags can track larger objects such as cargo containers. Tags on these containers can store a
manifest of the items shipped in each container. This manifest can be automatically updated when items
are removed from the container.

The information collected by a supply chain RFID system offers many benefits. By more accurately
tracking products throughout their life cycle, participants can realize improved speed and accuracy of
ordering, automated invoicing and payment, fewer supply shortages with lower inventory levels, and
reduced shrinkage (product loss or theft). Furthermore, RFID-based supply chain systems give
management programs better visibility into the supply chain, which enables identification of bottlenecks,
targeted recalls, and new forms of market research. Such systems also generate an electronic pedigree for
each item. This feature gives buyers evidence of the item’s freshness, so they can identify if its useful life
has expired. It also provides buyers evidence of a product’s authenticity, so buyers can determine if it is
an unauthorized clone.

3.2   RFID Information Characteristics

Once an organization determines the general application type that corresponds to the business process it
wants to enhance or enable with RFID technology, it should characterize the information that will be
processed by the system. At the low end of the data requirement spectrum is the case of EAS. In EAS,
systems, the necessary information is conveyed in a single bit: either the tag is functioning (the item has
not yet been sold), or it is has been deactivated (the product has been sold). For this reason, EAS is
referred to as a one-bit or single-bit application. Similarly, in the case of relatively simple asset
management systems, the only data required is the identifier on the tag. The RFID system merely records
which items are present or have been read by the reader. Matching applications also have relatively
simple data requirements because they just link one identifier with another.

Data storage requirements increase in tracking applications. The system needs to record which of
multiple readers last read the tag and at what time. As the tracking systems get more complex, more data
is collected, such as changes in the possession of the item (e.g., someone signing for a package) or the
particular contents of a container. Process control applications further increase data requirements because
they use the recorded specifications of an item to customize actions in the business process.

Supply chain management systems are the most data-intensive RFID application. They not only process
data, but they must also maintain information about the data, such as the formats the various organizations
in the supply chain use to store and transmit data and the network addresses of database servers that
contain data about tagged items.

When determining the appropriate RFID technology and security controls for a given RFID application,
the personnel responsible should ask three questions regarding each data element in the RFID system:

 Is it considered sensitive or confidential?
 Could the data element be easily correlated or combined with other data to allow someone to infer
  sensitive or confidential information through indirect means?
 Does it change, and if so, how frequently?




                                                     3-6
                                                    SECTION 3: RFID APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



In many cases, the data element is not sensitive. Organizations need to examine and invest in security
controls to protect RFID data depending on the sensitivity level of that data. They also need to consider
how data elements might be combined with other data to make inferences or build profiles, particularly if
data elements are shared across organizations or stored for long periods of time.

Another important characteristic of the data is whether it changes over time. In general, tag identifiers
never change, but the data associated with the identifier can change. For example, in asset management
applications, the RFID system may maintain information about product features such as make, model,
size, color, and serial number. These product features typically will be written once and then will not
change while the item remains in the system. However, if the asset management application’s primary
focus is tracking containers rather than specific items, then the data changes frequently as the container is
reused to store and transport new items. In access control applications, if a tag acts as a key for a
particular item, such as an automobile, then nothing should change once the tag is linked with that item.
If the access control application allows a security administrator to change someone’s access to different
areas and rooms based on changing business roles, then the system must store data related to the access
rules.

In general, the implementation specifics rather than the application type determine the extent to which
data must be modified. When data elements change, the supporting technology must support write
transactions and must have an access control mechanism to protect the integrity of the data. Sections
5.3.1 and 5.3.3.1 provide information on authentication and access control methods. When an element
does not change, it does not require this support. Organizations planning RFID implementations should
analyze what data is required to support the business process and which elements must be modifiable.
One important factor is whether tags and their identifiers will be used once and discarded, or reused. The
results of this exercise will help organizations identify appropriate RFID technology and security
mechanisms to meet their requirements.

3.3     RFID Transaction Environment

The conditions under which readers query tags are a significant determinant of an RFID system’s
technology requirements. The most important parameters regarding the RFID transaction environment
include:

 The distance between the reader and the tag,
 The amount of time in which a transaction must be completed, and
 Whether or not the reader has access to a network and can use the network to store related data.
Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 discuss these parameters.

3.3.1    Distance between Reader and Tag

Distance requirements often determine the type of tag that can be deployed. The distance between the
reader and the tag also has security implications. In general, longer distances between the reader and the
tag could make it easier for an adversary to eavesdrop on their communications. Longer distances also
allow an adversary to use their own reader to perform unauthorized transactions more easily (as discussed
in Section 2.3.3.3).

In some cases, the RFID system designer has considerable latitude in setting the distance between reader
and tag. For example, an application controlling access to a garage might require drivers to place an
RFID-enabled badge within inches of a reader or it might require a general proximity of several feet to a


                                                     3-7
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



RFID-enabled transponder within the vehicle. The choice is essentially an application design decision
that may include such factors as cost and convenience.

In other cases, the distance between reader and tag is dictated by the environment in which the RFID
system will be deployed. For example, a toll payment application that identifies vehicles on a highway
may require that readers query tags from a distance of several meters. In this case, the minimum read
distance is a requirement for the design of the RFID system.

3.3.2   Transaction Speed

Transaction speed can be measured in a variety of ways. A common metric is the number of tags read
per second. The main reasons why an application has requirements related to the speed of transactions
are:

 Readers are expected to communicate with multiple tags nearly simultaneously and cannot do so if
  each transaction takes longer than a certain period of time.
 Tagged items are in motion and only reside in a reader’s operating range for a limited period of time.
 The system’s users may perceive the application as a nuisance if transactions take longer than a short
  period of time to complete.
For example, in some inventory applications, operators may need to confirm the entire inventory at the
end of each business day. In this case, each transaction must be completed within a small fraction of a
second or the process may take too long to finish. Similar issues may arise when trying to read the tags of
athletes in a tracking system designed to measure race times. In this case, if the transactions take too
long, there is a chance that some participants in the race may go out of range before the reader identifies
them.

Many security mechanisms introduce latency into RFID transactions. Additional steps are needed to
perform authentication, encryption, cover-coding, and other security-related procedures. Each additional
step takes time. When considering security controls, organizations need to balance the business impact of
each security control’s effect on transaction speed with the protection it provides.

3.3.3   Network Connectivity and Data Storage

Whether or not an RFID system’s readers are networked with database applications has major
implications for the architecture of the RFID system and its security. When an application needs to link
data with tags, the data needs to be stored somewhere. If the readers are networked with databases, then
the data can be stored in the databases. Otherwise, the data must be stored on the tags.

When data is stored centrally on database servers, the tag only needs to contain an identifier, which links
the tag to its associated information. In this architecture, the vast majority of the data processing occurs
on the supporting systems to which the reader is connected. On the other hand, when data is stored on
tags, the tags must have some form of memory and support both write and read transactions.

Regardless of where data is stored, the data’s integrity must be protected. If the data is sensitive, its
confidentiality must also be protected. The methods for achieving this include authentication, access
control, encryption, and physical security. However, database servers and tags implement these methods
in different ways. Nearly all commercial database servers support a wide variety of configurable security
controls, but most tags do not. In general, RFID systems that use networked readers to access database




                                                     3-8
                                                   SECTION 3: RFID APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



servers are preferable to those that store data on tags, both in terms of cost and security. However, a
system may require local storage of data on tags for several reasons, including:

 Extending the network to a remote RFID reader is not feasible or is more expensive than using tags
  that support the required functionality.
 Accessing the data from the network introduces unacceptable latency.
 Network availability is inherently poor, perhaps as a result of harsh operating conditions, which
  makes accessing data on tags a more reliable approach.
 The participants in an open system have determined that the risk of storing data on tags is less than
  the risk of opening their networks to external entities.
 Each tag must collect and store information from a sensor or other data source before it can
  communicate with a networked reader.
 Users want control over when personal data is shared and therefore prefer that it remain on the tag
  and not in an enterprise database.
3.4     The Tag Environment between Transactions

RFID system requirements depend on what happens between transactions, as well as during transactions.
Relevant factors before and after reader communication include:

 Whether or not the business process requires that the tag collect data about its environment, and
 The human, technical, and environmental threats that pose risks to the tag’s integrity.
These factors are discussed in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.

3.4.1    Data Collection Requirements

In some applications, each tag is attached to a sensor that stores data in memory that is accessible to the
tag. The memory may belong to the sensor, to the tag, or to a combined device. In some cases, the
application’s core purpose is to capture this data, and RFID technology merely provides a vehicle to
access it remotely. In other cases, the sensor data supports an asset management or tracking application,
and the objective is to take measurements to ensure that storage or transport conditions are as expected.

3.4.2    Human and Environmental Threats to Tag Integrity

Tags are vulnerable to a variety of threats that could adversely impact the business processes that they
support. Selecting appropriate RFID technology and security controls depends on the level of the threat
in the environments in which the tags are expected to reside. Some human threats to tags include the
ability of an adversary to:

 Damage or destroy a tag,
 Remove the tag from the item to which it was attached,
 Replace a tag with another one, or
 Clone a tag and use the clone for an unintended purpose.




                                                    3-9
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



For example, in an EAS application, someone might remove or disable a tag to steal an item from a store
without triggering an alarm. Alternatively, someone could replace a tag with one from a lower-priced
item before purchasing the tagged item. In an access control application, someone might replace a tag
with one that has greater access. If the replaced tag were attached to a picture identification badge, an
adversary might be able to effectively gain the privileges of another person while appearing legitimate to
personnel who visually check the badge. 31

Environmental threats to tags include extreme heat, cold, moisture, vibration, shock, and radiation
(including sunlight). Any risk assessment of environmental threats should also consider the impact of
these conditions to the material to which the tag is attached and the glue or other mechanism that attaches
the tag to the item. Impacts of harsh environmental conditions include degradation of tag performance,
destruction of the tag, and separation of the tag from its associated item.

Organizations need to assess the likelihood of these threats in their environment and set requirements for
their RFID technology accordingly. In general, human threats are more likely to be realized if outsiders
(e.g., customers or members of the general public) have physical access to the tags and therefore the
means to engage in malicious behavior. Human threats are also more likely if people have an incentive to
perform the attack, such as some form of financial gain or access to a restricted resource.

3.5       RFID Economics

Cost-benefit tests can be applied to any technology project, but the RF subsystem of an RFID system has
differentiating characteristics, especially regarding security. Table 3-2 examines the key factors to
consider.

3.6   Summary

RFID technology can support a wide range of applications—from asset management and tracking to
access control and automated payment. The business requirements for these applications are as varied as
the applications themselves. In particular, they are implementation-specific and depend on such factors
as:

 The nature of the information that the RFID system manages, including its sensitivity and how it
  changes over time,
 The RFID transaction environment, including the distance between reader and tag, the required speed
  of the transactions, and the level of network connectivity during the transaction,
 The characteristics of the tag environment between transactions, such as whether tags collect data
  from sensors and the human and environmental threats that tags face, and
 The economics of RFID technology and security controls.

4.    RFID Risks

RFID technology enables an organization to significantly change its business processes to:

 Increase its efficiency, which results in lower costs,
 Increase its effectiveness, which improves mission performance and makes the implementing
  organization more resilient and better able to assign accountability, and
 Respond to customer requirements to use RFID technology to support supply chains and other
  applications.
The RFID technology itself is complex, combining a number of different computing and communications
technologies to achieve the desired objectives. Unfortunately, both change and complexity generate risk.
For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations need to effectively manage that risk, which
requires an understanding of its sources and its potential characteristics.

This section reviews the major high-level business risks associated with RFID systems so that
organizations planning or operating these systems can better identify, characterize, and manage the risk in
their environments. The risks are as follows:

 Business Process Risk. Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the
  business processes the RFID system was designed to enable.
 Business Intelligence Risk. An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access
  to RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the
  RFID system.
 Privacy Risk. Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses
  what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or
  understood. The personal possession of functioning tags also is a privacy risk because it could enable
  tracking of those holding tagged items.
 Externality Risk. RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or
  collocated systems, assets, and people.
An important characteristic of RFID that impacts all of these risks is that RF communication is invisible
to operators and users. In other AIDC and IT systems, it often is easier to identify when unauthorized
behavior is occurring. This section characterizes the risks listed above in more detail. The security
controls that mitigate these risks are discussed in Section 5.

4.1   Business Process Risk

RFID systems typically are implemented to replace or enhance a paper or partially automated process.
Organizations implementing RFID systems could become reliant on those systems, which if not
implemented properly with business continuity planning might be less resilient to disruptions than the
systems they replace. For example, suppose that a warehouse replaces its paper-based inventory
management system with an RFID-enabled system. The paper system involves storing completed forms
at the warehouse and sending form duplicates to a central office, while the new RFID system locates its
backend database servers at a single computing center. In this environment, the paper system might be
more resilient to a local disaster than the RFID system, despite the increased efficiency, accuracy, or
effectiveness of the RFID-enabled business process.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Failure in any component or subsystem of the RFID system could result in system wide failure. In the
warehouse example, system wide failure might result from many causes, such as loss of the network
connection between the warehouse and the computing facility, a software virus that disables critical
middleware functionality, or a new source of radio interference that prevents readers from accurately
reading tags. If an RFID system is rendered unavailable for any reason, then potential impacts can range
from a deceleration of the business process to the loss of critical business or operational records. If the
system is mission critical, then the consequences could be devastating to the organization’s performance.

Table 4-1 reviews some of the factors that determine the level of business process risk.

 The importance of the RFID-supported       business is logistics or asset management stand the most to lose when
 business processes to the mission of       their supporting RFID systems fail. If an organization’s primary mission
 the organization                           is outside these areas, it is less likely to be impacted. For example, a
                                            hospital whose primary mission is patient care could be significantly
                                            inconvenienced with the loss of an RFID system, but medical care is
                                            likely to continue regardless of the system’s status.
                                            In many applications, the fallback procedure is trivial to implement, in
                                            which case business process risk is relatively low. For example, a

Unlike most of the other risks, business process risk can occur as a result of both human action and
natural causes. Moreover, human causes may be intentional or unintentional. For example, a tag might

fail to perform its intended function because someone removed it from its packaging, an employee
accidentally damaged it with a box cutter, or a severe storm covered it in ice.

An example of an intentional attack on an RFID business process is cloning, which occurs when an
adversary reads information from a legitimate RFID tag and then programs another tag or device to
emulate the behavior of the legitimate tag. Documented examples of cloning have occurred in tags used
for financial payment 32 and access control. 33 Another attack on an RFID business process would be
removing a tag from the item it is intended to identify and attaching it to another unrelated item.
Someone might, for example, perform such an attack to get a better price on an expensive item in a store.

Potential problems are not just limited to the RF subsystem. If the network supporting the RFID system
is down, then the RFID system is likely down as well. In supply chain applications, network failures at
any point in the chain have the potential to impact the business processes of any subsequent link in the
chain. For example, if a supplier is unable to write manifest data to a tag, then the recipient cannot use
that data in its operations even if its RFID readers and network infrastructure are fully functional. Servers
hosting RFID middleware, databases, analytic systems, and authentication services are all points of
failure. Any efforts to assess business process risk need to be comprehensive, because such a wide
variety of potential threats exist. All of these threats have the potential to undermine the supported
business process and therefore the mission of the implementing organization.

4.2     Business Intelligence Risk

RFID is a powerful technology, in part, because it supports wireless remote access to information about
assets and people that either previously did not exist or was difficult to create or dynamically maintain.
While this wireless remote access is a significant benefit, it also creates a risk that unauthorized parties
could also have similar access to that information if proper controls are not in place. This risk is distinct
from the business process risk because it can be realized even when business processes are functioning as
intended.

A competitor or adversary can gain information from the RFID system in a number of ways, including
eavesdropping on RF links between readers and tags, performing independent queries on tags to obtain
relevant data, and obtaining unauthorized access to a back-end database storing information about tagged
items. Supply chain applications may be particularly vulnerable to this risk because a variety of external
entities may have read access to the tags or related databases. The risk of unauthorized access is realized
when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with that information.

In some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response. For example, someone might use a
reader to determine whether a shipping container holds expensive electronic equipment, and then break
into the container when it gets a positive reading. This scenario is an example of targeting.

In other cases, data might also be aggregated over time to provide intelligence regarding an organization’s
operations, business strategy, or proprietary methods. For instance, an organization could monitor the
number of tags entering a facility to provide a reasonable indication of its business growth or operating
practices. In this case, if someone determined that a warehouse recently received a number of very large

                                        exception of some access control applications, if tags contain only
                                        identifiers, then the risk is substantially lower than it would be if tags store
                                        data about the tagged item. Information potentially stored on tags that could
                                        be of great value to an adversary includes personal records, location history,
                                        container manifests, and sensor measurements.
 The usefulness or relevance of
 information available to the           Some adversaries might obtain valuable intelligence from the mere
 adversary                              existence of a tag or knowledge of the number of tags at a particular
                                        location. For example, if the tagged item is associated with an individual,
                                        then it could reveal the presence of that person at a specific location.
                                        Similarly, the number of tags at a location provides information about
                                        inventory levels. Accordingly, organizations need to consider how an
                                        adversary might use information about the presence of a tag as well as data
                                        stored on the tag.
                                        If tagged items are located in public areas, business intelligence risk is
                                        considerably higher than it would be if tags stay within access-controlled
                                        facilities. Another consideration is the ability of radio communication to
                                        occur beyond the physical perimeter. For example, if an adversary can read
 The location of RFID components
                                        tags outside of a facility’s fence, then the business intelligence risk is higher
                                        than it would be if signals were limited to a few feet and could not easily
                                        penetrate walls. The physical location of supporting IT infrastructure can
                                        also play a role in risk determination.
                                        The use of controls such as database access controls, password-protection,

                                        and cryptography can significantly mitigate business intelligence risk if

4.3    Privacy Risk

RFID technology raises several important privacy concerns. One concern is that organizations may
collect personal information for a particular purpose, such as to complete a financial transaction or grant
an individual access to a facility, and then later use that information for a different purpose that the
individual finds undesirable, such as to conduct a direct marketing campaign. Another concern is that
organizations that are implementing RFID systems to serve a particular business process might not be
aware of how the RFID information could be used for unintended purposes, such as the targeting or
tracking of individuals, or the potential disclosure of personal practices or preferences to unauthorized
third parties.




                                                          4-4
                                                                                        SECTION 4: RFID RISKS



There are privacy risks from the perspective of the individual and from the perspective of the organization
implementing RFID technology. The privacy risk from the perspective of the individual is the
unauthorized revelation of personal information and the personal consequences of that breach. The
privacy risk from the perspective of the implementing organization might include:

 Penalties if the organization does not comply with privacy laws and regulations,
 Customer avoidance or boycott of the organization because of real or perceived privacy concerns
  about RFID technology,
 Being held legally liable for any consequences of the weak privacy protections, and
 Employees, shareholders and other stakeholders might disassociate with the organization due to
  concerns about corporate social responsibility.
Business objectives often conflict with privacy objectives. Organizations can benefit from the analysis
and sharing of personal information obtained with RFID technology. At the same time, these activities
may potentially violate the privacy rights or expectations of citizens and consumers. Similarly, methods
to protect personal privacy may pose a business process risk. For example, consumers may want tags to
be disabled at point-of-sale so that they cannot be used for tracking purposes afterwards. However, if it is
easy to disable a tag at point-of-sale, then it may also be easier for adversaries to disable tags prior to
point-of-sale, thereby disrupting the business process. Moreover, organizations may want to use tags
after point-of-sale for post-sale support, recalls, and other purposes.

Privacy risk may increase when an individual possesses tags from multiple organizations because
someone reading the tags can now combine and correlate information to profile individuals in ways that
none of the organizations alone might have anticipated. For example, if a consumer purchases a tagged
item and the tag is not disabled or removed, then the seller or someone else could subsequently use the tag
to reveal the presence of that person at a another location and time. The consumer may have purchased
the item with cash, presuming to remain anonymous in the transaction. However, if she also carries
another tag that reveals her identity, such as an RFID-enabled identification card, then someone may be
able to surreptitiously read both tags to establish an association between the purchased item and her
identity that had not previously existed. As people possess more tagged items and readers become more
prevalent in everyday life, the potential for more complex associations and inferences increases.

Other factors that impact the level of privacy risk include:

 Whether personal information is stored on tags,
 Whether the tagged items are considered personal (e.g., pharmaceuticals or devices that would reveal
  a medical condition, or a book that might reveal a political or religious affiliation),
 The likelihood that the tag will be in the proximity of compatible readers,
 The length of time records are retained in analytic or archival systems, and
 The effectiveness of RFID security controls, in particular:

        –    The efficacy of tag memory access control and authentication mechanisms,

        –    The ability of tags to be disabled after their use in a business process has been completed,
             and

        –    The ability of users to effectively shield tags to prevent unauthorized read transactions.

4.4      Externality Risk

RFID systems typically are not isolated from other systems and assets in the enterprise. Every connection
point between the RFID system and something outside the RFID system represents a potential
vulnerability for the entity on the other side of the connection, whether that is an application process, a
valued asset, or a person. Externality risks are present for both the RF and enterprise subsystems of an
RFID system. The main externality risk for the RF subsystem is hazards resulting from electromagnetic
radiation, which could possibly range from adverse human health effects to ignition of combustible
material, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for the enterprise subsystem is successful
computer network attacks on networked devices and applications. Computer network attacks can involve
malware (e.g., worms and viruses) or attack tools that exploit software vulnerabilities and configuration
weaknesses to gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause other damage. The impact of
computer network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete compromise of a mission-
critical application.

Because the externality risk by definition involves risks outside of the RFID system, it is distinct from
both the business process and business intelligence risks; externality risks can be realized without having
any effect on RFID-supported business processes or without revealing any information to adversaries.

4.4.1      Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation

RFID technology, like any other radio technology, relies on the use of electromagnetic radiation to
communicate information. The potential risk of electromagnetic radiation includes:

 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to people (HERP),
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO),
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to fuel (HERF), and
 Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to other materials, including medical supplies such as blood
  products, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals.
As of the publication of this document, no documented examples have been identified that any of these
hazards have been realized with respect to RFID technology, which typically operates at power levels
below those that would cause a concern. Moreover, no research has suggested the realization of these
risks with respect to RFID technology is likely, although interaction with some medical devices has been
the subject of research studies. 34 The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgates
regulations to protect citizens against unsafe radio transmissions by requiring equipment testing and
certification. The FCC limits for general population/uncontrolled exposure are tabulated in Appendix E.

In addition, DoD regulations require HERO and HERF evaluation of RF systems. 35 It is important to
note that RFID systems may be within exposure limits when initially installed, but later exceed limits if
operators increase the emitted power of readers, perhaps to improve the performance and reliability of the
system.

Nevertheless, the critical consequences that would result from any realization of the risk suggest that
organizations exercise prudence when fielding RFID technology, especially in complex electromagnetic
environments. Electromagnetic signals and waves can reflect, interfere, and resonate in unintended ways
in complex electromagnetic environments that include metal objects such as metal doors, window frames,
and metal enclosures. This can result in unexpected or unintended signal and field cancellation,
interference, summation, or resonance. This makes it difficult to accurately predict specific localized
field levels from radiated power alone. Some factors that may warrant additional examination of
electromagnetic radiation hazards include:

 The use of RFID equipment that has not been certified by the FCC or that has been modified to
  operate outside of FCC mandated limits 36 (both of which are illegal in the US but may be legal in
  other countries), and
 Operating RFID equipment in environments in which signal reflections and other electromagnetic
  effects can focus radiation in unintended ways. 37
4.4.2    Computer Network Attacks

RFID technology represents a new attack vector on an enterprise network. Once RFID systems are
implemented, a possibility exists that attackers could reach non-RFID and enterprise subsystem
computers through a reader, although no such attack is known to have successfully occurred to date. If
the system involves wireless handheld readers, then the wireless link between the reader and the
networked middleware servers is another point of entry. Once RFID servers are compromised, they can
be used to launch attacks on other networked systems. Attack possibilities include the introduction of
malware (e.g., a worm or virus) or the exploits of a single adversary compromising one computer at a
time. Once additional systems are compromised, all types of adverse consequences to the IT
infrastructure are possible, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

While the risk of network compromise through an RFID interface is considered low, it is possible,
especially as the number of RFID reader, middleware, and enterprise applications increases. RFID
air-interface protocols do not support the execution of remote commands on the RFID interface, but if the
reader accepts data formats outside those expected by the protocol, then conceivably an adversary could
exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability on a reader by sending it non-compliant data. If the system is
poorly designed, the adversary may be able to insert code or commands in memory buffers read by
processes that can execute administrative functions such as disabling security controls. The potential
consequence is that the adversary could gain full control of the device and use that control to attack other
systems.

Although no known instance of this type of attack has occurred in a real-world application, RFID security
specialists have demonstrated RFID viruses in a controlled laboratory environment. 38 An RFID virus is a

     An example might be the hull of a steel ship, in which there are numerous reflective metal surfaces with a variety of
     curvatures. While everyday objects such as metal furniture or vehicle bodies can reflect and focus RF signals in ways
     difficult to predict, they are unlikely to cause electromagnetic hazards.

small program encoded on a tag that becomes active once it has been read and is then passed to the
middleware or database of an IT system. If the system is poorly designed, the virus could possibly take
advantage of internal software weaknesses in middleware or database products to replicate itself to other
tags. This distinguishes the risk from AIDC technologies such as bar codes that cannot be changed after
manufacture because they do not contain modifiable memory.

Some factors influencing the magnitude of the risk to the IT infrastructure and the applications they
support are presented in Table 4-3.

                                              The greatest factor determining the risk from an RFID system is the

 hosts and networks                           represents both a potential source of and target of attacks. If external
                                              network access is limited, risk is limited as well.
                                              The ability of RFID components to be breached largely depends on the
                                              assurance of the implementing software (e.g., reader drivers, middleware,
 Vulnerability of RFID software
                                              and analytic systems). Poorly developed software might be more easily
                                              compromised.
                                              The likelihood that an adversary with both the skills and motivation to
                                              compromise RF subsystem components depends heavily on whether the
                                              adversary is able to get within reasonable proximity to the components so
                                              that RF communication is possible. When tags and readers are in public
 Physical proximity to RF subsystem
                                              or easily accessible spaces, greater risk exists than when they are not in
                                              these areas. However, RFID enterprise servers can still be breached
                                              from network-based attacks even if the attacker has no access to RF
                                              subsystem components.

                                              implemented properly.


4.5     Summary

For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations should effectively manage their risk. The
major categories of risk are as follows:

 Business Process Risk. This encompasses threats and vulnerabilities that could cause part or all of
  the RFID system to fail. Potential impacts range from a deceleration of the business process to the
  loss of critical business or operational records. Business process risk can occur for many reasons,
  including human action (either benign or malicious) and natural causes. Factors influencing business
  process risk include the importance of the RFID-supported business processes to the mission of the
  organization, the robustness of business continuity planning, and the environment in which the RFID
  technology is located. The cloning of tags and attacks on enterprise subsystem networks are
  examples of threats to business processes.
 Business Intelligence Risk. This involves threats and vulnerabilities that could permit unauthorized
  parties to gain access to sensitive or proprietary information. A competitor or adversary can gain

    information from the RFID system in a number of ways, including eavesdropping on RFID
    transactions, reading tags, and gaining access to RFID-related databases. The risk of unauthorized
    access is realized when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with
    that information. In some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response, such as
    breaking into a container holding valuable goods. In other cases, data may also be aggregated over
    time to provide intelligence related to an organization’s customers, operations, business strategy, or
    proprietary methods.
 Privacy Risk. Privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is
  considered personal information for a purpose other than originally intended or if a third party uses
  the presence of tagged items to profile individuals. In the case of the latter, the primary privacy risk
  is likely borne by the consumer, not the organization that implemented the RFID system.
  Nevertheless, the RFID implementing organization still has privacy-related risks, including penalties
  from non-compliance with existing privacy regulations, legal liability, and the reaction of consumers,
  employees, public interest groups, and other stakeholders.
 Externality Risk. Every connection point between an RFID system and other systems represents a
  potential vulnerability. One externality risk for an RF subsystem is hazards resulting from
  electromagnetic radiation, which could possible range from adverse human health effects to ignition
  of combustible material, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for an enterprise
  subsystem is successful attacks on networked hosts and applications. Computer network attacks can
  involve malware or attack tools that exploit software vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses to
  gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause other damage. The impact of computer
  network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete compromise of a mission-
  critical application.

5.     RFID Security Controls

This section discusses security controls that can potentially mitigate the business risks associated with
RFID systems. As previously discussed, RFID implementations are highly customized. As a result, the
security controls listed are not all applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to
assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of controls for their environments, taking into
account factors such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of the threat, cost and performance.

Federal agencies should refer to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and NIST Special
Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
when developing or revising policies related to an RFID system. NIST Special Publication 800-100,
Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers may also be helpful as it provides a broad
overview of information security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish
and implement an information security program.

This section covers security controls applicable to most RFID implementations. It does not address the
security of RFID-enabled smart cards and payment systems. This section also does not discuss security
controls related to general IT systems, such as network infrastructure, databases, and Web servers because
these are already covered by other security requirements and guidelines. For example, EPCIS servers,
which can be accessed by trading partners through the Internet, should be protected by the same types of
controls that would be used for any other Internet-facing system (e.g., encryption of sensitive
communications, access control to prevent unauthorized access to data and systems) to ensure the security
of the data collected by the RFID system. Guidelines on topics such as IT server, application, database,
and network security are available from many sources, including NIST’s Computer Security Resource
Center (CSRC). 39

RFID security is a rapidly evolving discipline. Although promising research is noted when applicable,
this section focuses on controls that are presently commercially available.

The RFID security controls discussed in this section are divided into three groups: 40

 Management. A management control involves oversight of the security of the RFID system. For
  example, the management of an organization might need to update existing policies to address RFID
  implementations, such as security controls needed for an RF subsystem.
 Operational. An operational control involves the actions performed on a daily basis by the system’s
  administrators and users. For example, RFID systems need operational controls that ensure the
  physical security of the systems and their correct use.
 Technical. A technical control uses technology to monitor or restrict the actions that can be
  performed within the system. RFID systems need technical controls for several reasons such as
  protecting data on tags, causing tags to self-destruct, and protecting wireless communications.
The information provided for each control includes:

 The types of implementations or applications where the control might be helpful,
 The benefits that the control provides, such as which risks it mitigates, and
 The weaknesses of the control, including why it might not be effective in some environments, and
  what residual risks and other concerns remain even if the control is implemented.
The summary at the end of Section 5 summarizes the controls and maps them to the risk categories
discussed in Section 4.

5.1     Management Controls

Management controls are typically involved in risk assessment, system planning, and system acquisition,
as well as security certifications, accreditations, and assessments. The sub-sections below discuss
management controls for RFID systems in more detail.

5.1.1    RFID Usage Policy

Control: An RFID usage policy describes the authorized and unauthorized uses of RFID technology in
an organization and the personnel roles assigned to particular RFID system tasks. Federal agencies
should follow FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems, when developing the RFID usage policy.

The usage policy also should be consistent or integrated with the organization’s privacy policy, which
addresses topics such as how personal information is stored and shared. The RFID usage policy should
also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of
information based on solely on the tag identifier format selected. Additional information resources are
found in the privacy guidelines in Section 6.

Applicability: All organizations that use RFID technologies or are considering using them.

Benefits: The policy establishes the framework for many other security controls. It provides a vehicle
for management to communicate its expectations regarding the RFID system and its security. It enables
management to take legal or disciplinary action against individuals or entities that do not comply with the
policy.

Weaknesses: The existence of a policy does not ensure compliance with the policy. A policy needs to be
coupled with the implementation and enforcement of appropriate operational and technical controls to be
effective.

5.1.2    IT Security Policies

Control: IT security policies describe the approach to achieve high-level security objectives of the usage
policy. The IT security policies related to RFID should cover each RFID subsystem, including network,
database and application security in the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems; they should not just be
limited to security of tags and readers in the RF subsystem.

IT security policies for RFID systems should address:

 Access control to RFID information, especially records contained in RFID analytic system databases,



                                                    5-2
                                                                                       SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Perimeter protection, including port and protocol restrictions for network traffic between the RF and
  enterprise subsystems and between the enterprise subsystem and a public network or extranet,
 Password management, particularly with respect to the generation, distribution, and storage of tags’
  access, lock, and kill passwords,
 Management system security for readers and middleware, including the use and protection of SNMP
  read and write community strings, 41
 RFID security training for system administrators and operators, and
 Management of associated cryptographic systems, including certification authorities and key
  management.
Applicability: All RFID implementations, particularly those with enterprise subsystems or inter-
enterprise subsystems.

Benefits: Well-crafted security policies govern the mitigation of business risks associated with the use of
RFID technologies. The policies provide requirements and guidelines for the individuals designing,
implementing, using, and maintaining RFID systems. For example, IT policies help the personnel
designing RFID systems or procuring system components to make appropriate decisions. Similarly, they
help system administrators correctly implement and configure software and related network components.

Weaknesses: The existence of a policy does not ensure compliance with the policy. A policy needs to be
coupled with the implementation and enforcement of appropriate operational and technical controls to be
effective.

5.1.3    Agreements with External Organizations

Control: When data associated with an RFID system needs to be shared across organizational
boundaries, formal agreements among the participating organizations can codify the roles and
responsibilities, and in some cases the legal liability, of each organization. These formal agreements are
usually documented as a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
The MOU or MOA specifies the network connections and authentication mechanisms to be used, the data
to be shared, and the manner in which data should be protected both in transit and at rest. It may also
address controls on vendors, subcontractors, and other third parties to the extent they have access to the
system. 42

If the inter-enterprise application requires tag passwords to be shared across organizations, then the MOU
or MOA should specify how these passwords will be generated, stored, and shared. The memorandum
may specify IT security controls such as methods of authentication, access control, or encryption that
participating organizations shall implement to protect the passwords.

Applicability: Any RFID system involving more than one organization, which is most common in
supply chain applications.


41
     SNMP community strings are passwords that provide anyone with an SNMP management client and network access the
     ability to manage the associated systems. Knowledge of the read community string provides the holder the ability to view
     the system configuration and track system behavior. Knowledge of the write community string provides the holder the
     ability to reconfigure system components.
42
     For additional information on agreements with external organizations, see NIST Special Publication 800-47, Security Guide
     for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems, which can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-
     47/sp800-47.pdf.


                                                             5-3
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Benefits: Having an MOA or MOU significantly reduces the potential for subsequent misunderstandings
and security breaches. They enable signatories to communicate their respective security requirements
while also realizing the benefits of the business partnership that led them to collaborate in the
development and use of the RFID system.

Weaknesses: Monitoring an external organization’s enforcement of an agreement is difficult without full
access to its systems and personnel, which is unlikely. As a result, violations may occur without
detection. This risk can be mitigated with independent audits if signatories agree to hire third-parties to
conduct such audits.

5.1.4    Minimizing Sensitive Data Stored on Tags

Control: Instead of placing sensitive data on tags, the data could be stored in a secure enterprise
subsystem and retrieved using the tag’s unique identifier.

Applicability: Applications that use tags with on-board memory and process data that is either
considered sensitive or that could be combined with other data to infer sensitive information.

Benefits:

 Adversaries cannot obtain information from the tag through rogue scanning or eavesdropping.
 Data encryption and access control is often more cost-effectively performed in the enterprise
  subsystem than in the RF subsystem.
Weaknesses:

 Adversaries can often obtain valuable information from the identifier alone. For example, knowledge
  of the EPC manager ID and object class bits in certain EPC formats may reveal the make and model
  of a tagged object concealed in a container. An adversary might target containers based on the
  perceived worth of their contents.
 Placing data in the enterprise subsystem makes the availability of that data contingent on the
  availability of the network. Retrieving data over a network also introduces a small delay, which
  could be unacceptable for some applications. Section 3.3.3 discusses why organizations might
  choose to store data on tags even after taking into consideration the risks of doing so.
5.2     Operational Controls

There are several types of operational controls:

 Physical access controls restrict access to authorized personnel where the RFID systems are deployed.
 Proper placement of RF equipment helps avoid interference and reduce hazards from electromagnetic
  radiation.
 Organizations can destroy tags after they are no longer useful to prevent adversaries from gaining
  access to their data.
 Operator training can help ensure that personnel using the system follow appropriate guidelines and
  policies.




                                                    5-4
                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Information labels and notice can inform users of the intended purposes of the RFID system and
  simple methods users can employ to mitigate risk.
The sub-sections below discuss operational controls for RFID systems in more detail.

5.2.1   Physical Access Control

Control: Physical access controls include fences, gates, walls, locked doors, turnstiles, surveillance
cameras, and security guards. When the objective is to limit radio communication over a short distance,
room walls or partitioned stalls might provide adequate protection if they are opaque to the relevant radio
frequencies that the RF subsystem uses.

Applicability: All RFID implementations except those in which RFID tags or other system components
are in public areas.

Benefits: Physical access controls limit the ability of an adversary to get close enough to RFID system
components to compromise RFID data security or to modify, damage, or steal RFID system components.
Physical security applies to all RFID subsystems. In the RF subsystem, the primary objective of the
control is to prevent unauthorized radio communications. In the enterprise and inter-enterprise
subsystems, the primary objective is to prevent physical access to system components.

Examples of risks that are mitigated by physical access controls include:

 Unauthorized reading and writing of tag data,
 Rogue and cloned tags,
 Reader spoofing,
 Denial of service resulting from radio interference or unauthorized commands,
 Targeting,
 Physical destruction of RFID equipment, and
 HERF/HERO/HERP.
Weaknesses:

 Physical access controls are not a countermeasure for radio interference from legitimate radios
  located within a perimeter designed to block external emissions,
 The effective range of RF signals may be much longer than stated operating ranges, thereby allowing
  many attacks to occur using customized directional antennas and other technologies (see Section
  2.3.3.3 for additional information on relevant operating ranges),
 Physical access controls do not protect against attacks by insiders (i.e., those granted access to the
  area),
 HERF/HERO/HERP still exists with respect to radiation emitted within the physical perimeter, and
 Physical controls may fail to contain radio signals as expected if ductwork or other openings allow
  radio signals to escape.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



5.2.2     Appropriate Placement of Tags and Readers

Control: RFID system equipment can be placed to minimize unnecessary electromagnetic radiation.
Tags and readers can be kept away from:

 Fuel, ordnance, and other materials that could cause harm if exposed to electromagnetic radiation,
 Humans and sensitive products (e.g., blood, medicine) that might be harmed by sustained exposure to
  RF subsystem radiation,
 Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially
  harmful ways, and
 Legitimate radios with which the RF subsystem communication will cause interference.
Applicability: All environments in which the organization deploying RFID systems determines the
location of the RF equipment (which excludes many consumer and supply chain applications).

Benefits:

 Reduced risk of interference with legitimate radios
 Reduced risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized RF subsystem transactions
 Mitigation of HERF/HERO/HERP
Weaknesses:

 Tag location cannot always be controlled, such as when tags are used to track mobile items (e.g.,
  hospital cart) or items in transit (e.g., pallet on a truck).
 Radio interference may persist even if the tags or readers are placed in a new location that is still
  sufficiently close to other radios. 43
5.2.3     Secure Disposal of Tags

Control: Secure disposal involves physically or electronically destroying tags, as opposed to just
discarding them, when they are no longer needed to perform their intended function. Physical destruction
may involve manual tearing or shredding using a paper shredder. Electronic destruction can be
accomplished by using a tag’s kill feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to render a tag’s
circuitry permanently inoperable. When a tag supports an electronic disabling mechanism, it usually is the
preferred way to disable a tag before it is disposed because it can be accomplished without touching each
tag, thereby reducing the cost of the effort. The kill feature is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.3.

Applicability: RFID applications in which the continued operating presence of a tag after it has
performed its intended function poses a business intelligence or privacy risk (e.g., an adversary can
subsequently use the presence of the tag to track items or people).

Benefits: Destroying or disabling tags:

 Eliminates the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting, and

43
     In this situation, a panel or wall of grounded wire fencing between the two RF sources is a possible alternative means to
     reduce interference.


                                                               5-6
                                                                           SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Prevents access to sensitive data stored on tags.
These benefits apply to both business intelligence and privacy risks.

Weaknesses:

 Even if minimal, the effort it takes to destroy a tag increases the tag’s life cycle cost, which is a
  concern if very low costs are required to justify an RFID-enabled business process.
 Destruction of a tag precludes the ability to use it for future value-added applications such as post-
  sale product support, targeted recalls, receipt-free returns, expiration date monitoring, and sorting
  assistance for recycling.
5.2.4   Operator and Administrator Training

Control: Operator and administrator training provides personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary
to comply with RFID usage, IT security, and privacy policies, as well as agreements with external
organizations. In most RFID implementations, personnel will perform various roles, which might require
different training materials for each role. For example, an administrator of middleware might need
different information than an operator of a mobile reader. Appropriate security and privacy training
addresses at least three points:

 What constitutes unauthorized use,
 How to detect that unauthorized use might be occurring, and
 To whom to report violations.
If HERF/HERO/HERP risks are present, appropriate security training covers mitigation techniques, such
as safe handling distances.

If tags are destroyed or recycled, training should cover how to perform these functions. For example,
operators might be trained how to clear tag memory before reuse.

Applicability: All RFID implementations.

Benefits: Operator training helps ensure that the system is used and maintained properly. Training also
helps operators identify security violations and take appropriate actions to prevent their reoccurrence.

Weaknesses: Training alone cannot ensure proper operation of the system or compliance with policy.

5.2.5   Information Labels / Notice

Control: A written message is affixed to or distributed with each tag or is posted near readers. The
notice may inform users of the purposes of the RFID system or advise users on how to minimize privacy
or other risks (e.g., place an RFID-enabled access card or transponder in metal foil or a sleeve that shields
RF radiation when the card or transponder is not in use).

Applicability: All applications in which there is a risk that could be mitigated with simple informational
messages. The control is particularly relevant to consumer applications in which privacy is a concern.




                                                     5-7
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Benefits: Information labels or notices can communicate basic information about risks that might
otherwise be left unknown by users that are able to take simple steps to mitigate the risk (e.g., remove a
tag or place it in a shielded sleeve).

Weaknesses: Distributing a notice is no guarantee that it will be read or understood. Notice is not an
appropriate communications medium for complex concepts or instructions that may require formal
training.

5.2.6     Separation of Duties

Control: RFID system duties are distributed among various personnel roles to minimize the damage
resulting from an inadvertent or malicious activity of a single person. The general principle of the control
is that malicious collusion between two or more authorized users is much less likely than one person
engaging alone in inappropriate behavior.

One example of separation of duties is having different personnel (1) attach tags to objects and (2) read
the tags. If an individual performed both functions, the individual could intentionally put the wrong tag
on an object to circumvent the objectives of the business process. For example, a store clerk could affix
tags intended for low-priced items on high-priced items, and then later work the checkout scanner while
the clerk’s accomplice purchased the items. The system would not know that the tags had been switched,
but if another person performed the checkout, he or she might be suspicious of the checkout total, which
could uncover the plot.

Applicability: RFID applications in which an insider might have a motive to perform unauthorized
RFID transactions. This scenario is most likely to occur when tags support commercial transactions,
especially those related to high-value objects.

Benefits: Separation of duties helps to reduce fraud and malicious damage, because any user attempting
to engage in such activities would be forced to collude with at least one other user. Separation of duties
also reduces errors, because a second operator will often catch mistakes made or missed by the first.

Weaknesses: Multiple employees still could collude to commit fraud or violate the RFID usage policy.
Also, organizations with a limited staff may not be able to perform complete separation of duties.

5.2.7     Non-revealing Identifier Formats

Control: RFID tags are assigned identifiers using identifier formats that do not reveal any information
about tagged items or the organization operating the RFID system. Non-revealing identifier format
options include serially assigning identifiers and randomly assigning identifiers. 44

In contrast, if an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a standardized format, such as the EPC
format, that adversary may be able to discern the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of
item. For example, all cans of a soft drink from a certain manufacturer will have the same EPC manager

44
     A related control is rotating identifiers. Auto-rotating tags store a list of identifiers and cycle through the list when queried.
     To support multiple identifiers, databases in the enterprise subsystem must associate each identifier in the list to the
     particular item. The benefit of rotating identifiers is that organizations can make it more difficult to identity and track
     particular items as well as hide the type of item. Random and serialized identifiers, on the other hand, may not reveal
     information about the type of item, but since these identifiers are fixed, once they are revealed that particular item can be
     tracked. One weakness to rotating identifiers is that a rogue reader can easily obtain the complete list of identifiers through
     repeated queries. Therefore, this control is more appropriate when the primary threat is eavesdropping. While research is
     being conducted on the concept of rotating identifiers, it is not specified in any RFID standard and proprietary designs are
     not widely commercially available.


                                                                 5-8
                                                                                           SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



ID and object class bits if their identifiers are encoded in an EPC identifier format. Figure 5-1 shows an
example 96-bit EPC and how it can be parsed into the four aforementioned, individual fields.




                                               Figure 5-1. Example 96-bit EPC

Tags must have programmable identifiers to support the control. Even tags that are designed to support
standard tag formats can still be assigned non-standard identifiers in the field. However, some tags have
factory-initialized identifiers that cannot be modified after manufacture.

Applicability: Any applications in which the implementing organization determines that the revelation
of a tag’s identifier is a business intelligence risk.

Benefits: Adversaries cannot obtain information about tagged items from the identifier alone.

Weaknesses:

 The use of non-revealing identifier precludes an organization from realizing benefits that come from
  standard identifier formats that reveal organization and item type information. For example, standard
  identifier formats are particularly advantageous when designing and maintaining distributed databases
  in inter-enterprise systems. Lookup and query functions are much easier in such databases when the
  identifiers provide information on where item data is located.
 If identifiers are assigned randomly, then a potential exists that two tags may be assigned the same
  identifier. The likelihood of such an event is very small, but it could lead to errors in the supported
  business process. 45
 If there is logic in how the identifiers are assigned, an adversary may uncover the method that is used,
  which would defeat the control. For example, an adversary knows that an identifier was assigned to a
  certain item and that all items of that type were assigned sequentially, then the adversary may be able
  to deduce the approximate range of identifiers that correspond to items of that type. Similarly, when
  identifiers are serialized, the adversary may be able to deduce the approximate time of the assignment
  based on the identifier.
5.2.8     Fallback Identification System

Control: A fallback identification system provides an alternative means to identify, authenticate, or
verify an object when the RFID system is unavailable or an individual tag is inoperable. Options include
text labels and AIDC technology such as bar codes. 46 The fallback may consist of just an identifier, or it
may also include additional data about the tagged object. The fallback system is accompanied by
standard operating procedures and operator training to ensure that personnel know when and how to use
it.

45
     When two tags are assigned the same identifier, the event is called a collision. If identifiers are randomly assigned, a
     collision is expected after approximately the square root of the total number of possible identifiers. Therefore, in the case of
     a 96-bit EPC, a collision is expected after approximately 248 tags, which is an enormous number not likely to be encountered
     in most RFID applications.
46
     If the RFID application’s objective is to provide security or authentication, then a fallback technology such as holograms or
     other optical security features may be used.


                                                                5-9
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Applicability: All RFID applications.

Benefits: Duplicating tag identifiers and data on a label provides a fallback in case of malicious or
accidental tag damage, reader malfunction, or enterprise subsystem network outage. The redundant data
can also be used to verify that tag data has not been altered improperly.

Weaknesses: This control has several potential weaknesses, including:

 Damage to the tag could render both the stored data and the printed data unusable. Similarly, many
  enterprise subsystem outages that would affect the RFID system would also affect its fallback
  alternative.
 The data stored on the label is visible, so it may be easier for unauthorized parties to gain access to it
  than it would be to read the data from the tag.
 The text label or bar code might not provide the same data capacity as RFID memory, although two-
  dimensional bar codes can encode at least as many bits as standards-based tag identifiers.
 Text labels and AIDC technologies are static, so they do not provide a complete fallback solution for
  applications in which tag data changes over time. However, some identification information is still
  likely to be better than none in most applications.
5.3   Technical Controls

There are a number of technical controls currently available for RFID systems, and many others are under
development in industrial and university research labs. This section focuses on technical controls that are
commercially available as of the publication date of this document. Supplementary information on
selected emerging security technologies is provided in footnotes. Many of the technical controls listed are
specified in standards, while others are available only in proprietary systems.

Many technical controls related to a tag require the tag to perform additional computations and to have
additional volatile memory. Accordingly, a tag that uses such technical controls requires a more
sophisticated microchip than those that do not use such controls. In the case of passive tags, the tags may
also need to be closer to readers to obtain the required power to perform these computations.
Alternatively, readers may need to operate at greater power levels, although this may not be feasible or
permitted in many cases. These inherent characteristics of passive tags can limit the use of certain
technical controls in some environments.

Technical controls exist for all components of RFID systems, including the RF, enterprise, and inter-
enterprise subsystems. This section focuses on technical controls for the RF subsystem. Many controls
also exist for the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems, but these typically apply to IT systems in
general rather than to RFID systems in particular. Readers are encouraged to read other NIST IT system
and network security guidelines, many of which are listed in Appendix D.

The general types of RF subsystem controls include controls to:

 Provide authentication and integrity services to RFID components and transactions,
 Protect RF communication between reader and tag, and
 Protect the data stored on tags.




                                                    5-10
                                                                                       SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



Examples of each of these types of controls are discussed in depth in Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.3,
respectively.

5.3.1    Authentication and Data Integrity

While a wide variety of authentication methods exists for IT systems, the most common techniques for
the RF subsystem of RFID systems are passwords, keyed-hash message authentication codes (HMAC),
and digital signatures. In some cases, the primary objective of the authentication technology is to prevent
unauthorized reading from or writing to tags. In other cases, the objective is to detect cloning of tags.
Authentication techniques based on cryptography often provide integrity services for data included in the
authentication transaction; in other words, an adversary cannot modify data in the transaction without the
reader or tag detecting the change.

5.3.1.1 Password Authentication

Control: A tag does not permit password-protected commands to be executed unless they are
accompanied by the correct password. Protected commands may include those that support reading and
writing of tag data, memory access control (Section 5.3.3.1), and the kill feature (Section 5.3.3.3).

Organizations properly implementing this control will develop a password management system to support
it. The password management system addresses all stages of the password, including generation,
conveyance, and storage. From a security perspective, effective password generation involves random
selection of each password. 47 Whenever possible, the passwords are assigned to each tag in a physically
secure environment to reduce the likelihood of eavesdropping. Tags should not share passwords,
although this may not be administratively feasible in some environments, such as those in which the
reader is not expected to have access to a networked database of tag passwords. In inter-enterprise
applications such as supply chains, multiple organizations may need to access databases that contain tag
identifiers and passwords. Authenticating external entities likely will require additional security systems.
While in traditional IT systems, passwords are often changed on a periodic basis (e.g., every 90 days); in
RFID systems, such changes may be infeasible, especially if the tags are not always accessible to the
organization assigning the passwords.

Applicability: Any application where authorized execution of a particular command represents a
business process, business intelligence, privacy, or externality risk.

Benefits: The likelihood that tags will be used for unauthorized purposes is greatly reduced.

Weaknesses:

 Password management for RFID systems is complex, particularly if the application deploys large
  number of tags or if passwords must be shared across organizational boundaries as might be the case
  in supply chains.
 Adversaries can intercept passwords transmitted over the air and then use them at a later time to
  perform unauthorized transactions. 48


47
     For additional information on proper random number generation, see E. Barker and J. Kelsey, Recommendation for Random
     Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, NIST Special Publication 800-90, June 2006.
48
     RFID passwords are often transmitted “in the clear” (i.e., without cryptography to hide them), which makes them
     particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping. The cover-coding technique described in Section 5.3.2.1 mitigates this risk for
     tags that support cover coding, but this technique is not without its own limitations.


                                                            5-11
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 If the application environment precludes access to an on-line tag password database (e.g., mobile
  readers in remote locations), then the implementing organization may need to take simplifying
  measures, such as assigning the same password to multiple tags. In cases such as these, the
  compromise of a single password could compromise the integrity of the entire system.
 RFID passwords can be obtained through brute force methods (i.e., cycling through all possible
  passwords) when the tag technology is limited to short passwords. 49
 RFID passwords can be revealed through power analysis attacks on some types of passive tags. 50
5.3.1.2 Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

Control: Both the reader and the tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a
hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is
applied to messages, it also ensures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is specified in FIPS
Publication 198. 51 HMAC supports any cryptographic hash algorithm, but Federal agencies must use one
of the secure hash algorithms (SHA) specified in FIPS Publication 180-2. 52 HMAC is not specified in any
RFID standard, but it is available in proprietary designs.

Applicability: Applications in which passwords are considered to offer an inadequate authentication
mechanism, perhaps because the risk of eavesdropping is high. Applications that require evidence of a
tag’s authenticity.

Benefits: The advantages of HMAC relative to password authentication include that HMAC:

 Provides evidence of tag’s authenticity, 53

49
     For example, EPC Class-1 Generation-1 UHF tags support a maximum password length of 8-bits, which enables only 256
     possible passwords. An adversary can cycle through 256 passwords in a matter of seconds. EPC Class-1 Generation-2 tags
     support 32-bit passwords and, therefore, 232 possible passwords, which is sufficient if the passwords are randomly
     generated. However, if the binary password is based on American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
     characters, then the actual number of possible passwords may be much smaller. For example, the ASCII representation of a
     4-digit decimal number (a common length for personal identification numbers) is 32-bits, but results in only 10,000 possible
     combinations, a number certainly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Tags typically do not lock-out readers after a certain
     number of incorrect guesses, which means a determined adversary can continue to guess the password as long as the tag
     remains within the operating range of the adversary’s reader.

     The power analysis attack (also called a side channel attack) is based on the fact some passive tags use different levels of
     power depending on how close the password provided is to the actual password. For instance, if the first bit in a password is
     incorrect, the tag uses less energy than it would if the eighth bit is incorrect, given how the algorithm is hard-coded into the
     tag’s circuitry. These power differences are detected in the backscatter to the reader, but it requires that the adversary be
     reasonably close to the tag to get effective measurements. If such measurements are possible, an adversary can determine
     the password much more quickly than by using a brute force method. Lab experiments proved that someone could crack the
     8-bit password protection found on EPC Class-1 Generation-1 tags in one minute. For more information, see Y. Oren and
     A. Shamir, "Power Analysis of RFID Tags," discussed at the Cryptographers Panel of the Fifteenth RSA Conference, San
     Jose, 2006.

     The FIPS HMAC is a generalization of HMAC described in H. Krawczyk, M. Bellare, and R. Canetti, "HMAC: keyed-
     hashing for message authentication," Internet Engineering Task Force, Request for Comments (RFC) 2104, February 1997
     and American Bankers Association, "Keyed Hash Message Authentication Code," American National Standards Institute
     (ANSI) X9.71, Washington, D.C., 2000.
52
     The specified algorithms are SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. While SHA-1 offers the lowest level of assurance
     and is not recommended for use in digital signatures beyond 2010, it is likely most applicable to RFID systems due to its
     greater computational efficiency relative to the other algorithms. See NIST Special Publication 800-57, Recommendation
     on Key Management, Part 1 for additional information.
53
     The evidence of tag or item authenticity is provided by authenticating a tag to a reader, which can be accomplished when the
     tag computes and returns an HMAC using a random challenge provided by the reader. Mutual authentication is also
     possible if both tag and reader provide challenges to each other. Passwords, on the other hand, typically only are used to
     authenticate readers to tags, thereby protecting the tag against rogue commands. If the tag were to authenticate itself to a


                                                               5-12

 Provides integrity protection, 54 and
 Does not transmit secrets over-the-air, which eliminates the risk of eavesdropping inherent with clear
  text passwords.
Weaknesses:

 The management of HMAC keys provides similar challenges to those of password management and
  may not be practical if mobile readers do not have reliable access to an HMAC key management
  system.
 The authenticity claims associated with HMAC authentication only hold when the HMAC key
  remains secret. If an adversary has physical access to a tag and can obtain its HMAC key, then the
  adversary can clone the tag. This attack, however, assumes that that the adversary has some level of
  expertise, both in reverse engineering the HMAC-capable tag and in producing a reasonable
  facsimile.
 When HMAC keys are shared across organizations, authenticity claims rely on an implicit trust
  between the organizations that may not be present in practice.
 HMAC requires greater computing power than password comparisons, and therefore requires more
  complex tag designs to support it.
5.3.1.3 Digital Signatures

Control: Readers digitally sign tag identifiers, time stamps, and related event data to provide for non-
repudiation of tag transactions. The resulting signatures are stored on tags for subsequent verification,
although recording signatures in enterprise subsystem databases provides additional assurance of the tag’s
chain of custody.

Digital signatures are based on asymmetric cryptography, also commonly referred to as public key
cryptography. Federal agencies implementing digital signature technology must comply with FIPS
Publication 196, Entity Authentication Using Public Key Cryptography. The use of digital signature
technology in the context of RFID systems is also referred to as authenticated RFID. It typically works
as follows:

1. The tag has a permanent unique identifier than cannot be modified after manufacture.

2. The reader generates a public/private key pair and obtains a corresponding public key certificate.

3. The reader uses a specified hash algorithm to compute a message digest of the tag’s identifier and
   possibly other transaction-related data, encrypts the message digest with its private key to create a
   digital signature for the transaction, and stores the resulting signature on the tag.

4. Other readers read the signature, decrypt it with the first reader’s public key, and compute the
   identical message digest to determine if a match exists. If the message digests match, then
   verification procedure provides assurance of the authenticity of the earlier transaction. If the message


     reader using a password, an adversary could simply use a rogue reader to obtain the password and then re-use with a
     legitimate reader. HMAC provides an effective countermeasure to this attack because it never reveals the secret key during
     any of its transactions.
54
     Integrity protection is when either tag or reader computes an HMAC using as input the data for which integrity protection is
     desired. Any change in the data results in a different value of the HMAC, which would be detected by the receiving entity.


                                                              5-13
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



     digests do not match, then either the transaction data has been altered or an unauthorized device
     created the digital signature.

5. The other readers can store their own event transactions on the tag or record them in enterprise
   subsystem databases for later queries regarding the tag’s chain of custody.

Applicability: Applications that require more robust evidence of authenticity than provided by HMAC
technology, including authentication of multiple chain of custody events. Applications that require
verification of authenticity without network connectivity.

Benefits: Digital signatures offer several advantages relative to HMAC authentication, including:

 Digital signature systems do not require tags to store cryptographic secrets. Instead, readers maintain
  private keys. In password and HMAC authentication, both the tag and the reader must share a secret
  for the system to function, but there are no shared secrets in the public key cryptosystems that support
  digital signatures. Tags are typically much more vulnerable to compromise than readers, so
  eliminating the need to store secrets on tags enhances overall system security. One private key and
  one or more public key certificates are on the reader. Integrity is needed for the certificates, but not
  confidentiality.
 In many cases, digital signatures do not require network connectivity to successfully perform the
  authentication function. In password and HMAC authentication, a reader is unlikely to have the
  memory to store the passwords or keys for large numbers of tags. With digital signatures, a reader
  may only need to store the public key certificate of the entity that initialized the tags or perhaps a
  relatively small number of readers. In inter-enterprise systems, each participating organization only
  has to share the public keys of its readers rather than provide its partners reliable network access to a
  password or secret key database.
 Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. HMAC requires tags to support
  hash algorithms and to implement a challenge-response protocol, neither of which are included in
  existing RFID standards. On the other hand, in authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store,
  and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity resides
  in readers or middleware.
Weaknesses:

 A system of digital signatures requires a public key infrastructure (PKI), including registration and
  certification authorities, revocation functions, and associated policies and practice statements.
  Successfully implementing and operating a PKI requires careful planning and considerable expertise.
  In addition, readers or middleware need to support digital signature and other PKI functionality that is
  not commonly found in current RFID technology.
 Digital signatures systems require more memory than found on many current tags. For example,
  NIST recommends that RSA signatures have a length of 1024 bits, and a length of 2048 bits after
  2010. 55 Additional memory is required to store identifying information related to the transaction.
  Providing chain of custody evidence requires storing a digital signature and related identifying
  information for each transaction.



55
     Elliptic curve cryptography can reduce the size of signatures. Elliptic curve methods provide comparable assurance to 1024-
     bit RSA signatures with 163 bits, and to 2048-bit RSA signatures with 224 bits. This approach combined with greater
     memory on tags may alleviate storage concerns over time.


                                                             5-14
                                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Digital signatures that are not generated by the tag are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could
  query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous
  reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag.
 The use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support
  relatively complex cryptographic functions beyond the capacity of most common tag designs.
  Consequently, password or symmetric key authentication systems likely will support tag access
  control, as opposed to tag authenticity verification, for the foreseeable future.
5.3.2     RF Interface Protection

Several types of technical controls focus on the RF interface to tags, including:

 Cover-coding can be used to obscure the content of messages from readers to tags.
 Data can be encrypted prior to its transmission.
 Shielding can be installed to limit eavesdropping and rogue scanning.
 The selection of an operating radio frequency can be used to avoid interference from other sources or
  achieve certain operating characteristics such as the ability to propagate through metals, liquids, and
  other materials that are opaque to many frequencies.
 Reader and active tag transmission characteristics can be tuned to reduce the likelihood of
  eavesdropping and help mitigate interference and the hazards from electromagnetic radiation.
 The RF interface for tags can be temporarily shut off to prevent unauthorized access when the tag is
  not expected to be used for authorized purposes.
 The RF interface may be turned off by default until a user takes an action to activate it.
 Readers may periodically poll tags to determine the presence of the tags, assess system health, and
  acquire environmental data.
These controls are discussed further in Sections 5.3.2.1 through 5.3.2.8.

5.3.2.1 Cover-Coding

Control: Cover-coding is a method for hiding information on the forward channel from eavesdroppers.

In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, cover-coding is used to obscure passwords and
information written to a tag using the write command. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 cover-
coding protocol works as follows:

1. The reader sends a message to the tag requesting a key.
2. The tag generates a random 16-bit number (i.e., the key) and returns it to the reader.
3. The reader produces ciphertext (i.e., a message unintelligible to an eavesdropper who cannot intercept
   the key) by applying an exclusive-or (XOR) operation 56 to the key and the plain text.


56
     The XOR operation is a binary operation denoted with the symbol “⊕” that works as follows: 1 ⊕ 1 = 0; 1 ⊕ 0 = 1; 0 ⊕ 1 =
     1; 0 ⊕ 0 = 0. When the XOR operation is applied to two multi-bit strings, the XOR operation is applied to the first bit of the
     each string to produce the first bit of the result, the second bit of each string to produce the second bit of the result, and so


                                                                5-15
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



4. The reader sends the ciphertext to the tag.
5. The tag applies the XOR operation using the ciphertext and the key it generated to recover the plain
   text. 57
Cover coding is an example of minimalist cryptography because it operates within the challenging power
and memory constraints of passive RFID tags. 58 By itself, the XOR operation would be considered a
trivial encryption algorithm in traditional cryptography, but it nonetheless mitigates risk to an acceptable
level in many RFID environments.

Figure 5-2 illustrates how cover-coding works. As shown in the figure, the passive tag’s back channel
signal is weaker than the reader’s forward channel signal. This will always be the case for a passive tag,
which must use the forward channel to power both its computations and the backscattered signal. In the
figure, the adversary is able to eavesdrop on the forward channel but not the back channel. So long as this
condition holds, the adversary will not be able to learn the random number sent from the tag and therefore
will be unable to decipher cover coded information.




                                                Figure 5-2. Cover-Coding


     on. To work properly, the inputs to the XOR operation must be of equivalent length, and the output is also of the same
     length.
57
     The XOR operation is symmetric. For instance, given key K, plaintext P, and ciphertext C, if P ⊕ K = C, then C ⊕ K = P.
58
     For more information on minimalist cryptography, see A. Juels, "Minimalist cryptography for low-cost RFID tags," in the
     Fourth Conference on Security in Communication Networks, 2004, pp. 149-164.


                                                            5-16
                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



Applicability: Cover coding is useful when eavesdropping is a risk that requires mitigation, but
adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Intelligible reception of
back channel signals from a passive tag requires proximity of less than four meters in most applications.
In many applications, an adversary’s reception equipment would be conspicuous if it were located within
this range. In contrast, reader signals can be detected at distances of a kilometer or more under ideal
conditions.

Cover-coding is designed for RF subsystems in which the forward channel carries stronger signals than
the back channel, which essentially limits the control to passive tags. EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2
technologies support cover-coding. Proprietary technologies support similar features.

Benefits: Cover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorized commands that could disable a tag
or modify the tag’s data. Consequently, cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence,
and privacy risks.

Weaknesses:

 If an adversary can intercept a key distributed on the back channel, the adversary could decrypt any
  ciphertext message generated with that key.
 The effectiveness of cover-coding depends on the performance of the tag’s random number generator.
  If the random number is predictable due to a flaw in the tag’s design or cryptanalysis, then an
  adversary can learn the key and decrypt subsequent communication.
5.3.2.2 Encryption of Data in Transit

Control: Data collected or processed by the tag is encrypted prior to over-the-air transmission.

Applicability: Applications that require an effective countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and
for which cover coding offers inadequate protections. Tags typically only require on-board encryption
capabilities to protect the confidentiality of data in transit if they collect or process data from sensors or
other directly connected sources. In these cases, no alternative exists to hide the content of the data over-
the-air because the data originates on the tag.

On-board cryptography for confidentiality is not required for applications in which readers are the only
source of data. In these cases, the data can be encrypted in the enterprise subsystem or by a reader before
it is written to the tag and then retrieved in its encrypted form from the tag when needed. If the tag never
has to perform computations on the data, then it never has to decrypt it, but merely store it. Encryption
of data at rest is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.2.

Proprietary tag designs support encryption for over-the-air confidentiality, but EPCglobal and ISO/IEC
18000 standards do not as of the date of this publication.

Benefits: Encryption of data in transit prevents successful eavesdropping of over-the-air RFID
transactions.

Weaknesses:

 Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.
 Cryptographic functions may introduce an unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast
  read or write transactions.



                                                     5-17
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 Cryptographic functions require additional power to complete, which could impact applications that
  use passive tags.
 Tags that support onboard encryption currently are more costly than those that do not. One reason for
  the increased cost is that onboard encryption requires additional logic gates to perform the necessary
  computations. Most low-cost passive tags do not have enough logic gates to perform complex
  encryption algorithms. 59
5.3.2.3 Electromagnetic Shielding

Control: RF shielding encloses an area with a conducting material that limits the propagation of RF
signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding can vary in size and form depending on the application.

For example, some RFID-enabled travel documents are protected by a metallic anti-skimming material.
This material helps to prevent adversaries from reading the embedded tag when the passport cover is
closed. Shipping containers are sometimes shielded to prevent the reading of tags during transit.
Shielding is also placed in walls, partitions, or stalls to prevent RF emissions from leaving a confined
area. When readers are placed in tunnels on industrial production conveyor belts, the tunnels may be
shielded to reduce radio interference. Wrapping a tag in aluminum foil is also an effective means of
shielding.

Figure 5-3 shows how shielded partitions can separate collocated readers to prevent interference. The
readers near forklift A can operate without inadvertently reading tags on boxes on forklift B due to the
shielding in the partition that separates the portals. Shielding may be necessary when middleware is
unable to correctly filter duplicate read events from the two portals.

     Low cost tags currently have about 10,000 logic gates. The most efficient implementations of AES require 3,400 gates,
     which suggests that cryptographic support on low cost tags may be more feasible in the future. Source: M. Feldhofer, J.

                                  Figure 5-3. Grounded Metal Fencing as Shielding



Applicability: Shielding is applicable for contexts in which eavesdropping or RF radiation is a concern,
and the use of temporary shielding would not stop valid transactions.

Benefits: Shielding can limit the ability of eavesdroppers or unauthorized readers to collect data from an
RFID system.

Weaknesses:

 Shielding can prevent or hinder legitimate transactions. For example, shielded containers require
  objects to be physically removed from the shielding material. This prevents an implementing
  organization from realizing one of the key benefits of RFID technology, which is to read tags
  remotely without optical line of sight and additional handling.
 It may still be possible for an adversary to place a radio inside the shielded area. The radio could be
  used for malicious purposes, such as eavesdropping on RFID transactions or causing interference.
5.3.2.4 Radio Frequency Selection

Control: RFID technology can communicate over various radio frequencies, including those in the LF,
HF, UHF, and microwave bands. Particular fixed frequencies can be assigned to an RFID application to
avoid or reduce the effects of radio interference. Some tag technologies can perform frequency hopping
within a limited frequency range, but in these cases, the technique is used primarily to avoid collisions
with other tag transactions, not radio interference with different types of radio systems. 60 In some cases,

60
     For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 915 MHz UHF systems use frequency hopping techniques. This capability is
     built into tags complying with the standard. Therefore, organizations implementing RFID systems using EPCglobal Class-1
     Generation-2 compliant equipment do not have to configure this capability.


                                                           5-19
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



the implementing organization may need to obtain a license to use a particular desired frequency. Table
2-2 in Section 2.3.1.3 lists potential sources of interference on common RFID frequencies.

Ideally, an RF site survey will be performed before an RFID system is installed to determine what
frequencies are already in use. After the RFID system is installed, site surveys can be conducted to
determine if the RF characteristics of the site have changed (e.g., new sources of interference).

Applicability: All implementations whose radio frequency is not determined by other application
requirements. Organizations that implement a closed RFID system have more freedom to select an
operating frequency because they do not have to interoperate with other organizations. However, if tags
are based on a particular air interface standard, the range of potential frequencies will be limited to those
supported by the standard.

Benefits: Radio frequency selection permits the avoidance of RF interference with other radio systems
that could disrupt the RFID system or other technologies. A particular frequency might be desirable
because of radio interference on other frequency bands. Some frequencies also have desirable
propagation characteristics, such as the ability to penetrate certain materials.

Weaknesses:

 It may be difficult to identify sources of interference. For example, bug zappers have been found to
  create interference in passive RFID trials. 61 Interference can be caused by poorly grounded motors,
  noisy relays, old fluorescent light ballasts, and other devices that generate unintended RF noise in
  nearby environments. Each RFID technology deployment should be tested in its intended
  environment prior to production use to identify these sources of interference.
 New sources of interference can be later introduced at the site.
 When implementing an inter-enterprise RFID system, all organizations involved in the system will
  have to agree on a tag type that supports all the frequencies that the organizations collectively intend
  to use.
5.3.2.5 Adjustment of Transmission Characteristics Other than Frequency

Control: Operators adjust the level of transmitted RF energy from a reader or active tag. The use of
particular antenna types and configurations can also determine the direction of transmitted RF energy.
Additionally, the duty cycle of a reader can be controlled.

Applicability: All applications for which eavesdropping, radio interference, or hazards of
electromagnetic radiation are a concern.

Benefits: Reducing transmitted power can:

 Reduce the likelihood that an adversary can intercept communication,
 Limit radio interference with other legitimate radios, and
 Lessen hazards of electromagnetic radiation.

Weaknesses: The drawback of reducing transmission power or the duty cycle is performance
degradation, especially with respect to back channel communication from a passive tag. For instance,
readers might fail to detect the presence of valid tags. Also, changes in the physical environment or the
introduction of new radio equipment can impact the power levels required for consistently successful
transactions. Consequently, the benefits of power adjustments based on a site survey can be negated by
changes to the environment.

5.3.2.6 Temporary Deactivation of Tags

Control: The RF interface on some proprietary tags can be turned off temporarily. Tag manufacturers
have different methods of turning their tags on and off. For example, some tags are designed so that the
tag is on or off depending upon which end is inserted into a mounting clip. Other tags have replaceable
batteries that can be removed to deactivate them.

If the control is implemented, tags would be turned on inside a designated area where the RF subsystem
operates. When the tags leave that area, they would be turned off. For example, in a supply chain
application, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorized transactions during shipment. When the tags
arrive at their destination, they would be powered on again and managed. Conversely, tags used for in-
transit visibility may be turned on for their trip and turned off when they reach their destination.

Applicability: This control is most useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent
and predictable. For example, a warehouse might store items for an annual event, such as a holiday
celebration or parade. In this case, the RFID confers a benefit only for a short period each year, but could
remain vulnerable to rogue transactions if left operational for the rest of the year.

Benefits: Deactivating tags temporarily:

 Prevents unauthorized tag transactions during periods of inactivity, and
 Extends the battery life of active tags.
Weaknesses:

 If operators or system software fail to reactivate the tag when it is needed, then the missing
  transactions resulting from the tag’s RF silence could adversely impact the supported business
  process.
 If turning a tag on or off requires human intervention, then this control would result in additional
  labor expense, which could be significant for systems that process large numbers of tags. The
  potential increased labor required to operate the system could negatively affect the business case for
  RFID relative to other AIDC technologies.
 Even if the activation and deactivation process is automated, it introduces a delay that might not be
  acceptable for many time-sensitive applications.
5.3.2.7 Tag Press-to-Activate Switch

Control: The tag remains deactivated by default unless a user or operator takes a positive action, such as
holding a press-to-activate switch on the tag to turn it on. When the switch is on, the tag is capable of RF
communication, but when pressure on the switch is released, the tag returns to its default deactivated
status so that tag transactions can no longer occur.




                                                    5-21
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Applicability: Primarily access control or automated payment applications in which the holder of the tag
desires or requires control over when tag transactions occur.

Benefits: A press-to-activate switch provides a user with physical control over when and where the tag
can respond to a reader. Consequently, this control mitigates privacy and business intelligence risks by
providing a countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and the execution of unauthorized tag
commands. Eavesdropping would be limited to the immediate vicinity of authorized readers and tracking
beyond the immediate vicinity of the authorized readers would not be possible.

This control also provides assurance that a person is knowingly in possession of the tag, and that it has
not been intentionally or inadvertently separated from that person. For example, this control could be
useful in ticketing or access control applications in which the objective is to get an accurate count of the
number of individuals present, and to prevent spare tags in pockets or bags from interfering with the
accuracy of the count.

Weaknesses:

 Requiring the user to activate the tag would require some level of instruction, however minimal,
  which might add a cost or delay in the business process. For example, the user would need to know
  when and for how long they would need to activate the tag.
 Some users may consider activating a switch to be an inconvenience, which could hinder user
  acceptance of the technology.
 A press-to-activate switch could distract the user from other functions that the user is performing.
  For example, a press-to-activate switch is not an appropriate control for an automated toll-payment
  system because the user needs to have both hands available for driving the vehicle.
5.3.2.8 Tag Polling

Control: A reader periodically queries the tag to determine its continued presence and operating status.

Applicability: Process control or asset management applications in which a design objective is periodic
or near continuous monitoring. Examples include medical facilities that require real-time inventory of
certain medical supplies or systems that collect sensor data. Tag polling also is applicable for high-value
business processes that require early indications of system failures or performance problems. This control
is most effective in applications in which those with access to the tags are trusted or when detaching the
tag is not feasible (e.g., when a tag is embedded in another item such as a poker chip).

Benefits: Operators obtain timely information about system failures, item theft, or unusual
environmental conditions that enables them to proactively address problems.

Weaknesses: Tag polling:

 Reduces the battery life of active and semi-active tags,
 May not detect critical events in a timely manner if the polling frequency is too low,
 Is a business intelligence risk if the tag polling enables an adversary to perform traffic analysis, or
  track or target tags that might have otherwise remained silent, and.
 Could be circumvented in some cases by detaching the tag, taking the item, and leaving the tag

5.3.3    Tag Data Protection

Technical controls currently available for protecting tag data include:

 Tag memory access control, which can restrict use of tag commands and protect data stored in a tag’s
  memory,
 Encrypting the data on tags,
 The kill feature, which can prevent subsequent unauthorized use of a tag, and
 Tamper protection.
These controls are described in more detail in Sections 5.3.3.1 through 5.3.3.4.

5.3.3.1 Tag Memory Access Control

Control: Many tags support a password-protected lock feature which provides read or write protection to
memory. In some RFID technologies, the lock feature is permanent and in others it is reversible. For
example, the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 has five areas of memory, each of which can be protected
using the lock command. 62 The memory is either both read- and write-protected, or only write-
protected, depending on the parameters issued with the command. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2
UHF standard also has a permalock feature. If engaged, permalock will make the lock status (locked or
unlocked) permanent for all or part of a tag’s memory. ISO/IEC 18000-3 Mode 2 supports both read and
write protecting all areas of memory with a 48-bit memory access password. Finally, Mode 2 of the
ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard describes a lock pointer, which is a memory address. All areas of memory
with a lower address than the lock pointer are write-protected, while those areas of memory above the
pointer address are not.

The effectiveness of tag memory access controls depend on proper management of passwords. Section
5.3.1.1 provides additional information on password authentication.

Applicability: All applications that store data on tags.

Benefits: A write-protect lock command will prevent the contents of a tag’s memory from being altered.
A read-protect lock command will prevent unauthorized users from reading or accessing the data on tags.

Weaknesses:

 The password length on many tags is too short to provide meaningful memory access protection.
  Even when the technology supports longer passwords, password management is challenging (see
  Section 5.3.1.1 on password authentication for additional information).
 Locking a tag’s memory does not prevent data loss from electromagnetic interference or physical tag
  destruction.




62
     The five areas of memory are registers for the kill password, access password, EPC memory, TID memory, and User
     memory. When locked, the kill password and access password become both read and write protected. If they are locked,
     the EPC memory, TID memory, and User memory are only write protected.

5.3.3.2 Encryption of Data at Rest

Control: Data stored on a tag is encrypted before it is written to the tag. The control does not require
that the tag encrypt or decrypt data. Instead, the encryption is performed by either the reader,
middleware, or other enterprise subsystem components.

Applicability: All applications that store additional data beyond an identifier on the tag that needs to be
kept confidential on the tag. If the encryption and decryption functions are performed in the enterprise
subsystem, then network access is required to read the content of data stored on the tag, which makes the
control unsuitable for mobile readers that do not always have real-time network access.

Benefits: Data encryption protects sensitive tag data from being read by individuals with unauthorized
access to the tags.

Weaknesses:

 Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.
 Sending tag data to network components for encryption or decryption is a source of network latency,
  when in conjunction with the time to complete cryptographic functions may introduce an
  unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast read or write transactions.
5.3.3.3 Kill Feature

Control: The kill feature permanently disables a tag’s functionality using a remote command. The most
common implementation of the kill feature is the EPCglobal kill command. The EPCglobal Class-1
Generation-2 kill command is password-protected using a 32-bit password different from the access
password. 63

Applicability: RFID applications that encounter business intelligence and privacy risks after a tag has
moved beyond its intended functional environment (e.g., after a tag moves beyond the supply chain in
which it served inventory and checkout functions). EPCglobal tags are the only standards-based tags that
support a kill feature.

Benefits: Using the kill feature prevents a tag from being reused improperly. The kill feature was
designed and implemented in EPCglobal tags primarily to protect consumer privacy. It also protects
improper access to tag data used in business processes. For example, discarded tags that have not been
disabled may be read by adversaries to gain access to data, such as which products an organization or
individual is purchasing or using.

Weaknesses:




63
     Several alternative technical controls to the kill feature are under development, but have not yet been fully commercialized.
     One approach is to disable the tag’s antenna in such a way that it can still perform transactions over short distances (e.g., 10
     cm or less) but not longer than that. The objective is to greatly reduce the probability that an adversary could track or target
     someone in possession of the tag after the tag longer serves its primary purpose, but still enable the tag to perform some
     additional functions, albeit with additional effort. For example, the primary purpose of the tag might be to facilitate a point-
     of-sale transaction, but using the approach described, the tag could also facilitate a receipt-less return, although the item
     would need to be placed closer to the reader to complete this post-sale transaction. Another approach is to use multiple
     control domains as described in the immediately preceding footnote. The objective of both of these approaches is to extend
     the life of a tag to support some residual functionality that would otherwise be eliminated as a result of the kill feature.


                                                               5-24
                                                                                           SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 The existence of a kill feature represents a significant business process threat to an RFID system. If
  an adversary who learns the kill password improperly disables tags that should remain in operation,
  the supported application will not function properly because it will not be able to perform transactions
  on the disabled tags. This risk is particularly salient for organizations that assign the same password
  to multiple tags because doing so could enable an adversary to disable large numbers of tags with a
  single compromised password.
 Once killed, a tag cannot be used for any further application involving the asset (e.g., recalls, receipt-
  less product returns).
 If an organization assigns a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password for the kill command,
  unauthorized parties can kill the tag at will. 64 Moreover, the longer a tag maintains the same
  password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.
 Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag’s memory after it is killed (although it can no longer
  be accessed wirelessly), and therefore still may be accessible to someone with physical access to the
  tag. 65
 Although the kill command was added to tags as a potential solution for privacy concerns, consumers
  cannot easily detect whether a tag has been deactivated. 66 Moreover, typical consumers cannot easily
  kill tags on their own because this action requires a reader and knowledge of the kill password.
5.3.3.4 Tamper Resistance

Control: Certain RFID tags have tamper resistant or tamper-evident features that help prevent an
adversary from altering the tags or removing them from the objects to which they are attached. One
simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna; if a tag of this type is
removed, the electric connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more
complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the
objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.

Applicability: Applications in which tags are frequently outside of the direct control of the
implementing organization and therefore vulnerable to tampering. Tamper resistance and tamper-evident
features are currently only available on specialty RFID tags that are designed for tamper resistance to
support specific buyer requirements.

Benefits: This control helps to prevent adversaries from breaking the association between a tag and its
corresponding object. The more complex tamper-resistant / tamper-evident tags provide health and status
monitoring of the attached objects to ensure that they have not been opened, manipulated, damaged, or
subjected to extreme temperature, humidity, or shock.

Weaknesses: Sophisticated adversaries may be able to defeat the tamper resistance mechanisms. This is
dependent upon the implementation of the tamper resistance feature. For example, a sophisticated
adversary may be able to repair a frangible antenna. In addition, tamper-resistance / tamper-evidence
technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.


64
     An EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tag cannot be killed if it has a null password (i.e., one whose bits are all zeros). Source:
     EPCglobal, "EPC™ Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at
     860 MHz – 960 MHz Version 1.0.9," January 2005, pg. 58.
65
     Obtaining data from the tag in this circumstance would require an attacker to have specialized equipment and expertise.
66
     This may open a door for future consumer products to test for the presence of passive RFID tags and probe their
     characteristics. It is hypothesized that cellular phones may be able to provide this service for EPC passive tags since cellular
     phones already operate in the 860 to 960 MHz band.

5.4             Summary

Organizations should use a combination of management, operational, and technical controls to mitigate
the business risks of implementing RFID systems. Table 5-1 maps the presented controls to the
categories of risks that they mitigate. Because each RFID implementation is highly customized and each
organization’s requirements are different, the security controls discussed in this section are not all
applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to assess the risks their RFID
implementations face and choose the appropriate controls, taking into account factors such as regulatory
requirements, the magnitude of threats, and cost and performance implications of the controls. For
example, a remote warehouse may have little need to protect against eavesdropping, but it may require
redundant processes in case of system failure. Traditional security controls are often preferable to RFID-
specific controls. For example, if RFID data can be stored in an enterprise database rather than on tags,
then physical and network security controls for the database server probably are more practical than using
tags with cryptographic capabilities.

6.       RFID Privacy Considerations

While this document is primarily about securing RFID systems, privacy issues are often interrelated with
security considerations in a manner that one cannot be discussed without the other. For example,
protecting privacy often requires technical security controls related to data confidentiality. This section
explains what types of information are considered personal, reviews a number of privacy considerations
that impact the life cycle of RFID systems, explains general privacy controls, and lists privacy guidance
with which US Federal agencies are required to comply.

Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning,
implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization’s privacy
officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer when developing and enforcing privacy policy related
to the system.

6.1      Types of Personal Information

Federal privacy laws predominantly address the requirements for assessing, managing and safeguarding
data defined as personal information. Figure 7-1 provides a taxonomy of personal information that is
useful in describing privacy considerations for RFID systems.




                                       Figure 6-1. Taxonomy of Personal Information

For the purposes of current privacy regulation, the most important distinction about the information being
addressed is whether personal information is personally identifiable information (PII) or non-personally
identifiable information. PII is information that can be used to uniquely identify, locate, or contact an
individual. 67 Examples of data elements that typically are considered PII include, but are not limited to,
an individual’s full name, social security number, passport number, financial account or credit card
numbers, and biometric data such as fingerprints. Individual data elements associated with characteristics


67
      PII is also referred to as personally identifying information or “information in identifiable form,” which is defined in the E-
      Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2923, as “any representation of information that permits the
      identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.”
      Information “permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual” (see section 208(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II)) is the
      same as “information in identifiable form.”


                                                                 6-1

that many people share are generally not considered PII. Examples include age, gender, city of residence,
religious affiliation, and medical conditions.

Sometimes multiple pieces of information, none of which alone is considered PII, might still uniquely
identify a person when combined. For example, NIST may employ only one 39-year old female with a
residence in Roanoke, Virginia. In this case, the employer, age, gender, and city of residence are not PII
elements by themselves, but become PII when they are presented together. This scenario is an example of
PII established through indirect inference, while data elements such as a driver’s license number
constitute PII through direct inference.

As a general rule, privacy laws govern the management of PII inferred through both direct and indirect
means. The same laws, however, usually do not address data elements that individuals perceive as
personal information but do not meet the criteria of PII as defined by the E-Government Act of 2002. For
example, people anonymously walking down the street may perceive a loss of privacy if someone with a
reader can ascertain the books they are reading or the medicine they are taking, but not their identities, by
remotely scanning various tagged items in a bag, purse or on one’s person. In this case, the individuals
remain anonymous but may perceive a compromise of privacy because they do not have control over the
personal information they reveal to others. To address these concerns, organizations implementing RFID
systems may choose to mitigate the risk associated with these scenarios. In these cases, the range of
privacy considerations is not limited to those required by law.

6.2   The Applicability of Privacy Considerations to RFID Systems

RFID systems support a large variety of business processes, not all of which involve personal privacy.
Examples of RFID systems that likely do not have privacy considerations include those supporting
industrial processes, animal tracking, and asset management systems in which the assets are never
associated with individuals during their life cycle. Privacy considerations exist when the system uses,
collects, stores, or discloses personal information. An RFID system might use or disclose personal
information in one of several ways:

 Personal information such as a name or account number may be stored on the tag or in a database in
  the enterprise subsystem.
 A tag may be associated with a personal item such as a blood sample, a bottle of prescription
  medicine, or a folder of legal documents that might be outside of the individual’s possession.
 A tag may be associated with an item that often travels with an individual, such as a tagged box or a
  vehicle part in an automobile or truck the individual often drives.
The RFID system does not have to store personal information to have privacy implications. For example,
the tag on a bottle of prescription medicine may identify the drug in the bottle, but not the identity of the
person for whom the prescription was written. Nonetheless, the individual taking the medicine may still
perceive the possession of the drug as personal information if scanned and read by another, as it might
reveal information about a medical condition that the individual considers private.

Similarly, the individual does not have to own a tagged item for the RFID system to have privacy
implications. For example, if an employee carries an employer-tagged computer or tools, then RFID
technology potentially could be used to track the employee’s whereabouts. The employee may agree to
be on-call after business hours but could consider his or her location during those times as personal
information.

While the concepts of privacy and PII are not new, RFID technology is an example of a technology that
introduces new complexity to the landscape of privacy considerations for several reasons. For example,
RFID technology increases the likelihood that someone can create PII through indirect means. RFID
technology creates opportunities to record, store, and process item-specific information related to business
transactions more easily than ever before. In addition, the breadth of items in everyday life that will be
incorporated into RFID systems is expected to increase in the coming years. The increase in the coverage
of information systems in our daily life combined with the increase of the level of detail of information in
those systems will likely create new opportunities for combining data elements to generate PII. Advances
in Internet search and data mining software also will facilitate the ability to capture PII from large
volumes of what previously might have been considered uncorrelated data. All of these trends can occur
even if PII is not recorded on tags themselves.

Several inherent features of RFID tags make enforcement of privacy controls more difficult than
traditional information technology systems. Organizations may face challenges enforcing privacy
policies when they cannot be coupled with effective security controls. RFID uses wireless
communication, which is more vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks than the wired systems on
which most traditional IT systems reside. In many applications, RFID tags will travel between
organizations and often will be found in public areas, which means they cannot benefit from physical
security commonly provided to most traditional IT systems. In general, RFID computing resources are
limited and are not capable of implementing sophisticated technical controls. As this document describes,
many techniques exist to mitigate these security and privacy risks, and these are expected to improve over
time. However, the economics of many RFID applications will require low cost tags with limited
functionality, which has significant implications for privacy protections. Finally, in many applications,
especially those involving passive tags, identifiers can live beyond the usefulness of the application for
which they were intended, but still may store PII or be used to generate PII when combined with other
data. While traditional IT systems have well-established policies and procedures for the retention and
destruction of data, destroying or disabling tags may be infeasible once they are outside the control of the
organization managing the RFID system.
RFID technology may introduce new privacy considerations that are not fully understood today. Privacy
regulation and principles evolve to meet the demands of new IT systems. For instance, technical
advances such as the Internet, electronic databases, and analytic system software have made the collection
and sharing of PII easier than it was in a world of paper files. RFID technology further extends the reach
of IT systems and the collection and sharing of information that might be considered personal. While
today RFID readers typically are located in designated locations to support a particular business process,
in the future readers may be ubiquitous and capable of supporting multiple objectives. For example,
today an RFID system might be implemented to provide access control to a facility using RFID-enabled
badges. Badge holders are unlikely to possess other tagged items. In the future, badge holders may
routinely carry a number of tagged items, and the badge reader may be used to scan them and create a
profile as well as authenticate the badge. The data collected might be shared with third parties for
justifiable business needs and with legitimate data sharing agreements. The systems might be
implemented with disclosure and consent, but may not be effective because individuals and organizations
cannot reasonably understand all the potential uses of the data or predict what type of transactions might
create PII through indirect inference. For these reasons, new privacy tools and concepts may need to be
developed to address the complexity introduced by RFID technology.
6.3   Privacy Principles

An organization’s privacy policy is most effective when it is based on principles that reflect a thorough
understanding of privacy-related risks. Well-formulated principles lead to a baseline set of privacy
requirements that can be further tailored to address organization-specific or application-specific

considerations. In 1973, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the
Department of Health and Human Services) issued a report entitled Records, Computers, and the Rights
of Citizens. This report recommended that Congress enact legislation adopting a “Code of Fair
Information Practice” for automated personal data systems and many of its ideas were eventually
incorporated into the Privacy Act of 1974. 68 The HEW Fair Information Practices listed five main
privacy objectives:

 There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret;
 There must be a way for an individual to find out what information is in his or her file and how the
  information is being used;
 There must be a way for an individual to correct information in his or her records;
 Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of personally identifiable
  information must assure the reliability of the data for its intended use and must take precautions to
  prevent misuse; and
 There must be a way for an individual to prevent personal information obtained for one purpose from
  being used for another purpose without his or her consent.
In 1980, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adopted Guidelines on
the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which provide a framework for
privacy policy that has been referenced in US Federal guidance and internationally. 69 Table 6-1 lists the
OECD basic principles for privacy and data protection, their definitions, and discusses how each might be
addressed in the context of an RFID system.

6.4     Privacy Requirements for Federal Agencies

This section provides an overview of the following Federal privacy statutes and guidance that pertain to
Federal agencies and, in many cases, other organizations that handle, process, or share data with Federal
agencies:

 Privacy Act of 1974,
 Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002,
 Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, 70
 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 71 and
 OMB memoranda on the implementation of privacy requirements.
This section is not intended as an interpretation of law, legal advice, or a mandate for any organization.
Federal officials responsible for RFID systems should consult with the senior agency official for
privacy 72 , legal counsel, and other privacy compliance-related officials to appropriately identify and
integrate privacy controls into RFID systems. RFID privacy stakeholders also may include the Office of
the Chief Information Officer, the organizational components that the RFID system supports, and the
office implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Collaboration among RFID project managers and privacy officials will help ensure greater understanding
of privacy initiatives currently in place, provide for greater efficiencies in the use and sharing of agency
resources, and lower the risk of RFID projects. Additionally, collaboration can better ensure privacy
controls are considered early in the system development life cycle and avoid costly retrofitting of
solutions.

While Federal agencies must meet certain privacy requirements as a matter of legal compliance,
organizations not covered by the mandates may implement privacy controls for other purposes, such as to
maintain the trust and confidence of their customers and business partners, or to protect or enhance their
reputation. These organizations may still find it useful to review requirements for Federal agencies to
determine what might be appropriate for their environment.

6.4.1     Privacy Act of 1974

For over 30 years, the cornerstone of federal information privacy law has been the Privacy Act of 1974
(“the Privacy Act”), (5 USC § 552a), which was written before the widespread adoption of IT as the
primary means of managing data. The Privacy Act regulates the collection, use, maintenance, and

72
      The senior agency official for privacy may also be known as the Chief Privacy Officer or Privacy Advocate. In some cases,
      the role may be filled by the agency’s Chief Information Officer. The senior agency official privacy may also head an office
      responsible for Privacy Act implementation or other privacy-related law(s), but not hold one of these titles.

executive branch of the government. It also only covers information filed within a system of records,

6.4.2     E-Government Act of 2002

Title II, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 (“Section 208”) prescribes the establishment of a
privacy framework for agencies to manage compliance with privacy mandates passed since 1974. The
Act contains several provisions likely to apply to RFID systems, including requirements to:

 Perform a privacy impact assessment (PIA), 73
 Ensure employees, business partners and contractors are informed and educated of their responsibility
  to protect PII (if the RFID system manages or generates PII),
 Evaluate IT system and business model privacy risks for program activities and their information
  systems, and
 If the RFID system contains an inter-enterprise subsystem that enables external parties to access
  RFID information through a Web site, then the RFID system manager may also be required to:

          –    Ensure Web site privacy policies and notices adhere to Federal requirements,

          –    Comply with Web site tracking technology requirements, and

          –    Develop and implement a machine-readable privacy policy plan.
The Act also requires that agencies designate a point of contact for privacy compliance and related
matters. This official should be consulted throughout the life cycle of the RFID system.




73
     The PIA requirement applies to systems involving data collection from 10 or more members of the general public when one
     or more of the following "PIA triggers" occurs: (1) conversions - when converting paper-based records to electronic
     systems; (2) anonymous to non-anonymous - when functions applied to an existing information collection change
     anonymous information into information in identifiable form; (3) significant system management changes - when new uses
     of an existing IT system, including application of new technologies, significantly change how information in identifiable
     form is managed in the system: (4) significant merging - when agencies adopt or alter business processes so that government
     databases holding information in identifiable form are merged, centralized, matched with other databases or otherwise
     significantly manipulated: (5) new public access - when user-authenticating technology (e.g., password, digital certificate,
     biometric) is newly applied to an electronic information system accessed by members of the public; (6) commercial sources
     - when agencies systematically incorporate into existing information systems databases of information in identifiable form
     purchased or obtained from commercial or public sources. (Merely querying such a source on an ad hoc basis does not
     trigger the PIA requirement); (7) new interagency uses - when agencies work together on shared functions involving
     significant new uses or exchanges of information in identifiable form, such as the cross-cutting E-Government initiatives; in
     such cases, the lead agency should prepare the PIA; (8) internal flow or collection - when alteration of a business process
     results in new uses or disclosures of information or incorporation into the system of additional items of information in
     identifiable form; and (9) alteration in character of data - when new information in identifiable form is added to a collection
     raises the risks to personal privacy (for example, the addition of health or financial information).

6.4.3    Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 provides for FISMA provisions. The purpose of FISMA is to
provide a comprehensive framework for the management of federal information security, including the
establishment of a minimum level of controls to protect information and information systems, the
improved oversight of agency information security programs, and the use of commercially developed
information security products. For the past two years, OMB has required that in addition to the quarterly
reporting on compliance with FISMA security requirements, agencies must now report on their privacy
compliance posture with federal laws (for instance, the Privacy Act of 1974 and Section 208 of the E-
Government Act of 2002). In Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, OMB’s Instructions for Preparing the FISMA and
Privacy Management Report 74 prescribed that information and information systems must be categorized
and have an appropriate number of security controls and privacy considerations given to each. In
addition, OMB stated that there must be a mechanism in place to monitor the security controls and
privacy risks, as well as to determine the security and privacy deficiencies of the system.

6.4.4    Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005

Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“Section 522”) prescribes privacy rules for the
Departments of Treasury and Transportation, as well as Independent Agencies, but does not currently
apply to agencies outside this group. Section 522 extends the mandates in Section 208 of the
E-Government Act of 2002 to include requirements that agencies:

 Assure that the use of technologies sustain and do not erode privacy protections relating to the use,
  collection, and disclosure of information in an identifiable form,
 Assure that technologies used to collect, use, store, and disclose information in identifiable form
  allow for continuous auditing of compliance with stated privacy policies and practices governing the
  collection, use and distribution of information in the operation of the program,
 Assure that personal information contained in Privacy Act systems of records is handled in full
  compliance with fair information practices as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974,
 Evaluate legislative and regulatory proposals involving collection, use, and disclosure of personal
  information by the Federal Government,
 Conduct privacy impact assessment of proposed department rules on the privacy of information in an
  identifiable form, including the type of personally identifiable information collected and the number
  of people affected,
 Prepare a report to Congress on an annual basis on activities of the department that affect privacy,
 Ensure that the Department protects information in an identifiable form and information systems from
  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction,
 Train and educate employees on privacy and data protection policies to promote awareness of and
  compliance with established privacy and data protection policies,
 Establish privacy and data protection procedures and policies,
 Ensure compliance with the departments’ established privacy and data protection policies,

6.4.5     Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Privacy Memoranda

OMB has issued several memoranda that provide policy guidance and instructions for the implementation
of privacy laws, including: 75

 OMB Memorandum 03-22, Guidance for Implementing Section 208 of the E-Government Act of
  2002, provides information to agencies on implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government
  Act of 2002.
 OMB Memorandum 05-08, Designation of Senior Agency Officials for Privacy, was issued in
  support of the Administration’s commitment to protecting information privacy, and required each
  executive Department and agency to identify to OMB the senior official who has the overall agency-
  wide responsibility for information privacy issues. The senior agency official should have authority
  within the agency to consider information privacy policy issues at a national and agency-wide level.
 OMB Memorandum M-06-15, Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information, reemphasizes
  agencies’ responsibilities to appropriately safeguard sensitive personally identifiable information and
  to train its employees on their responsibilities in this area. It explains how Senior Agency Officials
  for Privacy should conduct FISMA reporting, review their policies and processes, and take corrective
  action as appropriate to ensure adequate safeguards prevent the intentional or negligent misuse of, or
  unauthorized access to PII.
 OMB Memorandum M-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Agency Information, provides a checklist for
  safeguarding information removed from or accessed outside of an agency’s physical location.
 OMB Memorandum M-06-19, Reporting Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information and
  Incorporating the Cost for Security in Agency Information Technology Investments, provides updated
  guidance on the reporting of security incidents involving PII. It explains new requirements related to
  security and privacy with which agencies must comply beginning with fiscal year (FY) 2008 budget
  submissions for IT.
 OMB Memorandum M-06-20, FY 2006 Reporting Instructions for FISMA and Agency Privacy
  Management, provides FISMA security quarterly reporting instructions that will apply annually
  beyond FY 2006 unless amended. It also includes quarterly reporting instructions for agencies’
  privacy compliance management activities.
6.5     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996

The HIPAA privacy and security rules represent a national effort to protect individuals’ personal health
information (PHI) 76 from unwarranted access and disclosure. The covered entities include all health care
providers, insurers, third-party administrators, and the business partners of these entities.

The privacy rule defines PHI as health information that can be associated with a specific individual. It
describes the policies, procedures, and business service agreements required to control the access to and

use of PHI. In all but a few circumstances, disclosure of PHI is only permitted if the organization has
obtained the individual's consent in advance. The security rule addresses an organization’s infrastructure
requirements to assure secure and private communication, as well as the confidentiality of patient
information.

To comply with HIPAA, organizations must identify how RFID-enabled business processes create,
collect, store, monitor, transmit, or share PHI. In particular, organizations should explore how PHI may
be established through indirect means, including scenarios in which information obtained from RFID tags
may be combined with other data to infer someone’s identity or link it with health information. One
example mentioned previously is the possibility that, without implementation of appropriate controls,
someone may be able to identify that an individual is consuming prescription drugs or a particular type of
drug by surreptitiously reading information on a tagged label. Scenarios involving medical devices may
present similar risks. Perhaps the greatest HIPAA privacy compliance challenges occur when RFID-
tagged medical services and products are delivered or purchased outside the boundaries of hospitals or
doctor offices because it is more difficult to enforce controls in these circumstances.

6.6   Federal CIO Council Privacy Control Families

Organizations may be required to implement privacy controls to comply with the laws and regulations
discussed earlier in this section or they may do so voluntarily to protect and improve relationships with
customers, business partners, and employees. To assist agencies with their privacy programs, the Federal
Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council (“CIO Council”) developed a reference model that describes 17
privacy control families. Many of the privacy control families are closely related to the security controls
discussed in detail in Section 5. How controls within these families will be implemented for RFID
systems will vary depending on the characteristics of the business process the RFID system supports. For
RFID technology supporting transportation initiatives will likely have a different set of privacy controls
those involving delivery of healthcare. However, both would likely involve privacy controls within the
notice and consent family. The control families and related considerations for RFID systems are
presented in Table 6-2.

6.7   Industry Resources Addressing RFID Privacy

The EPCglobal Guidelines on EPC for Consumer Products are a set of principles that are intended to
address the need for privacy and consumer trust (i.e., Consumer Notice, Consumer Choice, Consumer
Education, and Record Use, Retention and Security). The Guidelines were created to provide a
responsible basis for the use of EPC technology for consumer items. It is anticipated that these principles
will continue to evolve with advances in EPCglobal technology and its applications. Additional

Questions document is provided on the EPCglobal Inc Web site at

The Center for Democracy and Technology drafted Privacy Best Practices for Deployment of RFID
Technology 77 as a stakeholder response to privacy challenges posed when personally identifiable
information is involved.

6.8     Summary

Privacy considerations are interrelated with security considerations. A key objective of any RFID
security program is to identify risks and controls for safeguarding PII. An organization implementing a
security and privacy program for an RFID system should consult its privacy officer and legal counsel
throughout the information system development life cycle.

A privacy program may protect different types of personal information. Some information is personally
identifiable, meaning that someone can use it to identify a particular individual. Other information may
not be personally identifiable, but individuals may still consider it private even in settings where they are
anonymous. For example, an individual anonymously traveling on a public bus may not want other
passengers to know what items are in her handbag.

Information that is not PII typically is not subject to legal requirements, but many people may still
consider this information personal and worthy of safeguards. Therefore, organizations may still choose to
implement privacy controls voluntarily to safeguard information its customers, business partners,
employees, and other stakeholders consider personal.

Federal law governs Federal government agencies’ collection and handling of PII. Relevant statutes
include the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, FISMA, and the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2005. OMB memoranda provide policy guidance and instructions for agencies’
implementation of these laws. The privacy of health information is covered by HIPAA, which applies to
non-Federal as well as Federal entities.

The Federal CIO Council developed a list of privacy control families that provide a reference framework
for those integrating privacy principles into RFID systems. In some cases, controls can serve to enhance
both security and privacy. In other cases, the privacy controls complement security controls. Since RFID
implementations are typically highly customized, the privacy controls listed are not always applicable or
may not be effective for all RFID systems.

7.    Recommended Practices

As explained in Sections 2 through 5, there are numerous ways to implement and configure RFID systems
to support a wide variety of applications. RFID systems typically must be highly customized to support
the business processes they automate; no one-size-fits-all approach will work across implementations.
Nevertheless, organizations can benefit from following some general principles when using RFID
technology. This section describes a set of recommended security practices that can help organizations
manage RFID risks to an acceptable level.

To be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle –
from policy development to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle to help
organizations determine the most appropriate actions to take at each point in the development of the RFID
system. The life cycle is based on a model introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project
management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases presented here, but
the types of tasks and their sequencing are probably similar. The phases of the life cycle are as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation. This phase covers the tasks that an organization should perform before it starts
  to design its RFID system. These tasks include conducting a risk assessment and developing policy
  and requirements with which the RFID system must comply.
 Phase 2: Acquisition/Development. For the purposes of this guide, the acquisition/development
  phase is split into two sub-phases:

        –   Phase 2a: Planning and Design. In this phase, RFID network architects specify the
            standards with which the RFID system must comply, the network infrastructure that will
            support the system, and the technical characteristics of the RFID system, including the types
            of tag and readers that will be deployed. This phase should also include site surveys of the
            facilities and relevant IT infrastructure.

        –   Phase 2b: Procurement. In this phase, the organization specifies the RFID components that
            must be purchased, the feature sets and protocols they must support, and any standards on
            which they must be based.
 Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, procured equipment is configured to meet operational and
  security requirements, RFID data is integrated with legacy enterprise systems, and staff are trained in
  the proper use and maintenance of the system.
 Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an organization
  should perform on an ongoing basis once the RFID system is operational, including conducting
  periodic security assessments, applying security-related software patches, and reviewing RFID event
  logs.
 Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur when a system or its components
  have been retired, perhaps as a result of a significant upgrade. These tasks include preserving
  information to meet legal requirements and disabling or destroying tags and other components when
  they are taken out of service.
The practices presented in this section are provided in tables corresponding to the life cycle phases. Each
practice is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion and is rated as
“recommended” or “should consider.” Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the
“recommended” practices. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of an RFID security

failure. Organizations should also examine each of the “should consider” practices to determine their
applicability to the target environment. A “should consider” practice should be rejected only if it is
infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its implementation does not justify its cost.

Organizations should develop their RFID security controls based not only on the practices in the tables,
but also using other guidelines on security controls. FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, establishes three security categories—
low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular
system. NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems, provides minimum management, operational, and technical security controls for
information systems based on the FIPS Publication 199 impact categories. The information in NIST
Special Publication 800-53 should be helpful to organizations in identifying controls that are needed to
protect networks and systems, which should be used in addition to the specific practices for RFID systems
listed in this document. Federal agencies should also use NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the
Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, to evaluate their RFID system
and select appropriate security controls.

The RFID policies that an organization develops should be consistent with existing IT and operations
policies. However, in some cases, the organization may need to modify the existing policies to
accommodate the introduction of an RFID system.

Some large organizations may divide RFID-related duties among various teams. For example, one group
may be responsible for the RF subsystem, while another might focus on the enterprise subsystem. To
assist with this division of labor, the tables in this section identify the affected subsystem or components
(e.g., tag or reader) for each of the listed practices.

The tables can also serve as checklists. In particular, the status column on the right is blank so that RFID
support staff or auditors can use it to measure progress toward implementation of the practices.

                                     An RFID usage policy is the foundation on which subsequent security
                                     controls are based. The policy should cover all components of the
                                     RFID system, including tags, readers, and support systems (e.g.,
                                     middleware and analytic systems). The policy should distinguish
                                     between the levels of access provided to those that use the system,
                                     those that administer it, and those that need access to its data,

       what business purposes this   parties should almost never get access to an organization’s readers,
       authorization applies.        but they might need read access to certain database elements. The
                                     policy should also address the collection and handling of sensor data
                                     that might be transmitted over the RFID system.
                                     The RFID usage policy should also integrate privacy policies and
                                     practices. All statements made in privacy compliance documentation
                                     should be reflected in and supported by the RFID usage policy.
                                     Federal government agencies are required to create a Privacy Impact
                                     Assessment (PIA) if the RFID system will store or manage personal

                                     be in place before RFID system architects determine the appropriate

                                             The appropriate disposal or destruction mechanism depends on the
                                             type of tag, the level of assurance required, and the cost of the
                                             destruction. When tags contain memory, this memory should be
                                             rendered inaccessible. Options include the kill command and
                                             physical destruction. Many tags can be rendered inoperable by
                                             cutting them with a box knife, scissors, or other sharp object. The
                                             antenna on some tags can be separated from their transmitters by
                                             tearing them by hand, although accessing the tag data is still possible
                                             through physical analysis. Even if a tag contains nothing but an

                                             This attack is particularly salient for EPCglobal tags, because of the
                                             potential to discern the identity of the EPC Manager from the pointers
                                             returned by the Root ONS. In many cases, the tag identifier also
                                             reveals the serial number of the asset. On the other hand, many
                                             organizations may determine that that this risk is acceptable,
                                             especially if database records corresponding to a particular identifier
                                             are erased or disabled when the tag is no longer needed.
                                             Information contained in the audit records may be needed even after
                                             an RFID component is discarded (e.g., for an investigation of a

                                             concern in some applications. For example, records may reveal

                                             items or transactions in a manner that violates privacy laws or policy.
                                             In these cases, the requirement may be to destroy the records after a

8.      Case Studies

This section presents two hypothetical case studies to illustrate how RFID security might be implemented
in practice. Although the case studies are fictional, they are intended to resemble real-world activities,
including how decision makers address common and expected RFID security problems and their
solutions. The case studies do not cover all of the aspects of RFID system engineering or operations that
an organization may encounter in its RFID implementation, but rather a representative sample of salient
issues. The two case studies are as follows:

 Case Study #1: Personnel and asset tracking in a health care environment, and
 Case Study #2: Supply chain management of hazardous materials.
In each case study, the fictional organization followed the information system development life cycle
introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System
Development Life Cycle, and the practices discussed in Section 7.

8.1     Case Study #1: Personnel and Asset Tracking in a Health Care Environment

The Contagion Research Center (CRC) is a health care facility dedicated to the study of highly contagious
diseases—those transmitted through casual human contact. The Center has 40 beds for patient care, a
radiology unit with two rooms of sophisticated imaging equipment, and four laboratories with various
diagnostic and research capabilities. The Center confronts the same management issues as many
hospitals, including locating portable diagnostic equipment when needed and accounting for missing
assets. Another important concern is the ability to quickly locate patients and staff as they move about
the facility. Poor asset management results in higher costs, reduced efficiency, and lower quality of care.

The mission of the CRC also leads to specialized requirements. To prevent unnecessary outbreaks of
disease and to understand how transmission occurs, CRC needs to track the interactions among its staff,
patients, and visitors. These tracked interactions provide useful information to researchers about who
came into contact with whom and at what time. Additionally, CRC must alert caregivers of disease-
specific protocols when they are in close proximity to particular patients, including prohibiting staff
contact in some cases. It must track blood, urine, and stool samples from patient to laboratory. Finally,
CRC would like to track the history of in-house diagnostic equipment and trace how the equipment is
used to support patients throughout each day. Currently, paper processes are used to achieve these
objectives, but they are very labor-intensive and error-prone, sometimes with fatal consequences.

CRC executives tasked the CRC’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) to use RFID technology to improve
the CRC’s traditional asset management function, as well as meet its specialized requirements. Working
with the CRC executives, the CIO commissioned a project to reengineer CRC business practices using
RFID technology as a primary tool to improve organizational performance.

8.1.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The first step in the project was to conduct a risk assessment to help shape the final scope of the project
and identify the most appropriate uses of the RFID technology, as well as potential controls to mitigate
the accompanying risk. Some risks identified during the assessment were as follows:

 RFID systems could open a “backdoor” to the CRC computer network, which could result in the
  compromise of mission-critical systems and research archives.




                                                     8-1
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 Anyone eavesdropping on RFID transactions could compromise the privacy of patient medical
  records.
 The CRC could be held liable for violations of the privacy provisions of Health Insurance Portability
  and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
 The radio frequencies used by the RFID system could interfere with wireless patient sensors and
  medical telemetry devices, which could impact quality of care and research results.
 Dermal contact with RFID tags might be a potential vector for the transmission of some highly
  contagious diseases.
The risk assessment also concluded that some RFID risks were minimal or nonexistent in the CRC
environment. The worst case for expected patient and staff exposure to RF radiation was forecasted to be
significantly below any level that might adversely affect their health. CRC already had a well-enforced
policy that prohibits the storage of fuel or ordnance at the facility, and the use of potentially explosive
material such as ether and oxygen tanks was tightly controlled. The likelihood that an adversary would
attempt to use the CRC RFID system to gather intelligence or target personnel was deemed negligible.

As a result of the risk assessment, the CRC enhanced its network security policy to require that the RFID
system be separated from other network systems using a firewall that permits only required data and
management traffic to traverse the network boundary. The network security policy also was amended to
require user authentication to all non-stationary RFID readers and encryption of wireless traffic between
mobile readers and access points. Existing policy regarding secure server configurations and least
privilege 89 data access would extend to the RFID systems without requiring any modifications. The CRC
also decided that it would not institute a new requirement for wireless intrusion detection, but it would
revisit this decision during the following fiscal year.

The CRC also conducted a privacy assessment based on information collected during the risk assessment.
As a result, the CRC privacy policy was revised to account for the introduction of RFID technology. The
revision noted that any patient data collected by the RFID system would be subject to the CRC’s internal
procedures implementing HIPAA regulations. A final determination was made to update patient release
forms to include a statement that inherent risks exist with wireless communications and that network
security controls were implemented to help mitigate these risks.

Based on the project charter and the updated security and privacy policies, the CIO led an
interdisciplinary team of medical practitioners and information technology professionals to develop the
business and functional requirements for the RFID system. These requirements formed the basis for the
phases of the project that followed.

8.1.2     Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

The acquisition and design phase of the project involved planning the RFID system. One design decision
was to select the tag type for each application. Many of the items to be tracked, including laboratory
samples and disposable supplies, were numerous and would be scanned at very close ranges (within 10
centimeters). For these items, passive tags made the most sense, given their low cost. People, high-value
assets, and mobile equipment such as carts, gurneys, and wheelchairs needed to be tracked as they moved
around the facility. The readable range for these applications needed to be at least a few meters. The
team considered active tags, but worried that they could cause interference problems when located in the
radiology unit. Accordingly, they selected semi-active tags, which are less likely to emit radiation
89
     The principle of least privilege in computer security refers to the concept of granting each user and each module of a system
     only the necessary resources to perform authorized actions.


                                                               8-2
                                                                                     SECTION 8: CASE STUDIES



inadvertently and which have a considerably longer battery life than active tags, but which still have
effective operating ranges within CRC’s requirements.

The next step was to plan the location of the stationary readers and the frequencies at which they would
operate. In preparation for this exercise, CRC had qualified individuals perform a site survey, which
recommended locations for the readers and identified existing spectrum utilization within the facility.
They found that patient sensors and medical telemetry devices were operating at low frequencies (125
kHz) and at ultra high frequency ranges (915 MHz). Frequencies throughout and above the radio
spectrum were identified in the radiology unit. Based on this information, the design team determined
that the passive RFID system would operate in the high frequency range (13.56 MHz), and the semi-
active RFID system would operate at microwave frequencies (2.45 GHz).

While the risk of eavesdropping from locations outside the facility was considered to be very low, the
design team still thought it would be of value to mitigate the risk to the greatest extent feasible.
Therefore, they ensured that design drawings placed readers away from windows and exterior walls.
Preferred locations were over doorways in rooms and on ceiling mounts in hallways. The devices would
be prohibited in the radiology unit, but would be placed at entries to the unit. Previously installed
shielding in the walls would prevent emissions from impacting the operation of the imaging equipment
inside the unit.

The design team determined that stationary readers would be connected to the RFID middleware
infrastructure using Ethernet, which is also used to network the desktop computers and servers in the
building. To accomplish this, the plan called for the installation of additional network cabling and drops,
and use of the existing Ethernet switches, which had considerable excess capacity. Having the RFID
systems, desktops, and servers all cabled into the same switches created a risk that the RFID system could
be used as a platform to launch an attack on the rest of the network. To mitigate this risk, the design
called for a dedicated VLAN to host the RFID-related network hosts. Traffic could only pass from the
RFID VLAN to other network segments if it traversed the network firewall required by policy in the
initiation phase.

Once the architecture was completed, the CIO assigned two members of the design team to the job of
procuring the system with her review and approval. They paid particular attention to the products’ audit
and management capabilities. Four vendors provided demonstrations of their products and submitted
bids.

8.1.3   Phase 3: Implementation

The various components of the system arrived over a three-week period following the procurement effort.
The implementation team followed the CRC secure configuration guidelines when building all the servers
hosting RFID enterprise software and databases. The implementation team configured all the audit events
and alerts on the RFID systems to be directed to a CRC audit server cluster that supports all of the CRC
IT infrastructure. They also ran a vulnerability scan on all hosts after the installation to identify
remaining weaknesses. Approximately a dozen minor issues were discovered and quickly resolved,
mostly through the application of software patches. The last step in preparing the infrastructure was to
configure the firewall traffic filters and VLAN architecture specified during the acquisition/development
phase.

Applying tags to all the items within the scope of the project was a challenging and time-consuming task.
When possible, tags were positioned on items in such a way as to minimize the probability of tampering,
destruction, or removal. They were also placed where patients are unlikely to experience dermal or
respiratory contact, therefore reducing the probability that a tag’s surface could ever be a mechanism for


                                                    8-3
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



the spread of disease. Tags on patients were embedded in hospital admission wrist bracelets. Tags for
staff and hospital personnel were embedded in their hospital identification cards, which are typically worn
around the neck on a lanyard or on a retractable leash attached to the belt.

8.1.4   Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance

The operation of the new systems proceeded as expected. CRC experienced a reduction in asset losses
resulting from better tracking and some personnel mentioned that the system significantly reduced
paperwork. The system also provided benefits to CRC research. In one case, patients in separate rooms
under the supervision of different medical teams contracted a particular illness. These facts initially led
the CRC epidemiologists to believe that an airborne pathogen caused the disease. Subsequent analysis of
the RFID data showed that a medicine cart handled by several nurses’ aides was the likely infection
vector by transferring the disease from patient to patient through dermal contact.

The operations phase also included the management of the RFID system. Hospital IT personnel received
pages when systems were malfunctioning and took corrective actions as necessary. Recently, audit
records showing excessive numbers of malformed read transactions led to the detection of an
unauthorized radio in the proximity of one of the readers.

8.1.5   Phase 5: Disposition

The new RFID system has not been in operation long enough to encounter significant disposition issues,
but the CRC has instituted procedures for the disposal of RFID tags. The passive tags on disposable
items are discarded along with the item. In the case of tags on blood, urine, and stool samples, the tags
are disposed as hazardous medical waste. Semi-active tags on patients are disposed of as medical waste
upon death or discharge. Data did not need to be removed from the tags prior to disposal because the tags
only stored an identifier. Semi-active tags on physical assets are reassigned when the asset is retired. If a
tag is malfunctioning, it is physically disabled to ensure inoperability and discarded with office waste.

8.1.6   Summary and Evaluation

The system involving read-only passive and semi-active tags is helping reduce costs and improve
research. Security risks were identified early, and risks were managed to an acceptable level. Table 8-1
presents a summary of how each risk identified in the risk assessment was subsequently addressed.

8.2     Case Study #2: Supply Chain Management of Hazardous Materials

The Radionuclide Transportation Agency (RTA) oversees the movement of radioactive research materials
between production facilities, national laboratories, military installations, and other relevant locations.
The RTA oversight of the supply chain for these materials involves many of the same issues as in most
any other supply chain. The agency wants to know who is in possession of what quantity of materials at
any given time. It also wants to locate materials at a site quickly, without having to search through
numerous containers to find them. Bar code technology does not provide that capability.

Some of RTA’s requirements are more unique. For instance, much of the transported radionuclide
material must be closely monitored because extreme temperatures or excessive vibration can make it
useless for its intended applications. Consequently, RTA wants temperature and vibration sensors to
continuously measure environmental conditions and record readings on the tag. Additionally, the
handling of RTA-regulated materials is a homeland and national security issue. If the materials were to
fall into unauthorized hands, they could endanger the public welfare.

8.2.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The project team began with a risk assessment, which identified a number of concerns, the most
significant of which were as follows:

 An adversary could identify and target a vehicle containing RTA-regulated material.
 An adversary could eavesdrop on tag transactions to learn the characteristics of the material, which
  could help determine whether it is worth stealing.
 An adversary could damage or disable a tag, making it easier to steal material without detection.
 An adversary could alter sensor or manifest data stored on the tag in an effort to undermine the
  business processes for which the material is being used.
 The radiation from readers could accidentally cause combustion of collocated volatile materials when
  several of them are operating concurrently in close proximity.
To help address the risks, RTA established a policy that required that tagged items only be identifiable
during embarkation, debarkation, and storage, but not during transport. The policy further stated that tag-
reader communication should be authenticated whenever technically feasible with commercial-off-the-
shelf systems. The RTA conducted a privacy assessment that identified that the system would handle PII
due to the need to associate materials with particular individuals, although most such information was
already contained in existing logs. The agency updated its privacy disclosure statement for employees
and contractors to account for the new technology. Finally, it required that all personnel involved in
handling of the tagged materials be provided RFID security and privacy awareness training. The agency
already had a HERF policy, but everyone agreed the introduction of the RFID system would require the
agency to revisit the efficacy of these HERF-related controls.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



8.2.2    Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

The acquisition/development phase focused on the planning and design of the RFID system. The nature
of the supply chain was such that tagged items would be located at numerous facilities, including future
facilities not yet known at time the design was created. However, some general parameters were known.
For instance, readers would need to read tags from distances up to 10 meters, and this capability is
typically only found in active tags.

The design team spent a significant amount of time on how to mitigate risks associated with the RF link
between the readers and the tags. It determined that the risk of eavesdropping and rogue RFID
transactions could be within acceptable levels if adversaries were located at least 100 meters from the
storage area. 90 The few facilities that could not maintain a perimeter of that distance would rely on bar
code technology, which RTA understood would significantly increase labor costs at these sites relative to
those using RFID because people would need to be hired to scan items and open containers to inventory
their contents.

To address the requirement of preventing readings during transport, the design team specified
mechanisms for shielding containers and vehicles. The shielding would prevent adversaries from
determining that items inside a vehicle were tagged, thereby reducing the risk of targeting. In the case of
shielded transport vehicles, tags could be read when they were removed from the vehicle at debarkation.
Many vehicles were shielded prior to the RFID program to prevent harmful radiation from escaping the
vehicle. When vehicles were not shielded, tarp-like shielding could be placed around containers within
the vehicle and then easily removed when they leave the vehicle. While some users would benefit from
the convenience of reading tags from outside the vehicle, the risk this introduced outweighed any
potential advantage it offered. Indeed, the primary objectives of the RFID system were to identify the
facility at which a radionuclide sample was located and to quickly find items once stored, neither of
which necessitated readings when the item was in transport.

The tags were also password-protected using a proprietary technology to prevent unauthorized parties
from reading or writing to the tags. Because custody of the tags moved from one organization to another,
the RTA decided to host a central password database that could be remotely accessed by the RFID
middleware of each participating organization. To limit access to the central database to business
partners, it was placed on a VPN called RTAnet to which each of the partner organizations connected.
The VPN isolates the RFID activity from public networks, thereby making it difficult for an outside
adversary to perform a successful attack.

The team also had to tackle the HERF risk. Although the probability was small that readers would cause
combustion of volatile materials stored near radionuclide material, the devastating consequences of its
realization still made it a significant concern. The primary mechanism was to use an HF system because
it would be less likely to cause combustion than higher frequency UHF and microwave technology. New
guidelines also required a separation of five meters between fuel and tagged items unless the volatile
materials were shielded.

8.2.3    Phase 3: Implementation

The implementation phase was straightforward, given the extensive planning in the previous phase. The
first task was to conduct a pilot test of the system to identify potential problems before they adversely
impacted the full supply chain. The test exercise uncovered several interoperability issues with RTAnet

90
     The risk was determined by field tests to be acceptable because the 100 meter distance was shown to prevent eavesdropping
     of tag to reader communications.


                                                             8-6

devices. In particular, some of the readers did not work properly with the middleware because an
undocumented feature conflicted with the settings RTA selected for its equipment. The vendor issued a
patch to its software that solved the problem.

8.2.4   Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance

Once the system was fully operational, the RTA was able to obtain regulatory information more quickly
than before, which reduced the labor time required to support the program. Suppliers and consumers of
the regulated materials also decreased their paperwork. They also were able to better match supply of
materials with demand for them, since authorized organizations could retrieve information about the
quantities present at each site.

The operations phase also included security monitoring. All participating organizations signed a MOU
that covered sharing of information pertaining to possible intrusions or security exploits and proper
management of PII. The MOU also included a provision that prohibited participating organizations from
using PII for any purpose not explicitly stated in the MOU. This close cooperation enabled one of the
suppliers and a national laboratory to recognize a recurring attack pattern across facilities that might
otherwise have been ignored.

8.2.5   Phase 5: Disposition

As a new program, RTA has not actively confronted disposition issues. It plans to instruct participating
organizations to retire their RFID systems as they would any other system holding data that RTA deems
sensitive. In most cases this involves using disk wiping utilities to delete sensitive files. With regard to
tag disposition, RTA’s position is that organizations are free to recycle tags so long as they clear sensor
and manifest data before affixing a tag to a new item.

8.2.6   Summary and Evaluation

The RTA RFID initiative allowed the agency to exercise more effective oversight of the transportation of
radionuclide material while also reducing the regulatory compliance cost of impacted organizations.
Some important security concerns had been raised, particularly with regards to the possibility that an
adversary might use the RFID tags as targeting devices. Early identification of these risks allowed them
to be managed during each stage of the systems. A listing of the main risks and the corresponding
mitigation approach is presented in Table 8-2.

Appendix A—RFID Standards and Security Mechanisms

RFID readers and tags must conform to the same standards and designs to be interoperable. These
standards and designs also can be used to coordinate the use of certain tags across multiple enterprises
and in the supply chain. Common standards and designs may facilitate training, future equipment
procurement, and equipment upgrades. Some readers and some tags can operate using multiple standards.
This appendix describes international and industrial standards for RFID systems, as well as security
mechanisms used in those standards. It also discusses regulations for frequencies used by various RFID
standards and non-standard implementations. For the updates on the status of any particular standard,
readers should refer to the standard body’s official Web site.

A.1     International Standards

RFID standards have been developed by national and international standards groups such as the ISO and
the IEC. There are separate standards for contactless smart cards and for item management.

ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 are the most popular smart card standards.

 ISO/IEC 14443 describes proximity smart cards which have an intermediate range up to 10 cm and
  operate at 13.56 MHz. The standard contains four parts: (1) physical characteristics, (2) radio
  frequency power and signaling, (3) initialization and anti-collision, and (4) transmission protocols.
  ISO/IEC 14443 has two variants known as ISO/IEC 14443A and ISO/IEC 14443B which have
  different communications interfaces. Readers that are ISO/IEC 14443 compliant must be able to
  communicate using ISO/IEC 14443A and ISO/IEC 14443B. ISO/IEC 14443A parts 1 through 4 are
  used in the DoD Common Access Card (CAC), which serves as an identification card. The CAC has
  a FIPS-approved algorithm.
 ISO/IEC 15693 operates at 13.56 MHz and describes vicinity smart cards which can be read from a
  farther distance than proximity cards. Such cards have a range of up to approximately 1 meter.
ISO/IEC 18000 is an RFID standard for item management and describes the air interface for various
frequencies. Each standard within the ISO/IEC 18000 family defines communications parameters and
applies to a specific electromagnetic frequency. ISO/IEC 18000-1 covers general parameters, and
ISO/IEC 18000-2 through 18000-7 cover specifics for particular frequency ranges.

 ISO/IEC 18000-2 covers frequencies below 135 kHz. It has two types, A (Full Duplex) and B (Half
  Duplex). These types are different on the physical layer. A full duplex tag can communicate with a
  reader while the reader is simultaneously communicating with the tag. A half duplex tag supports bi-
  directional communication with a reader but only one device, the tag or the reader, can communicate
  at the same time.
 ISO/IEC 18000-3 covers frequencies operating at 13.56 MHz and describes two non-interfering and
  not interoperable modes of operation. Users are recommended to use just one mode for any single
  application. Both modes use a 64-bit identifier.

        –   Mode 1 has a locking feature that is not protected by a password. If the tag receives the lock
            command, it locks the corresponding area of memory permanently. Lock can be applied
            selectively to different blocks of memory.

        –   Mode 2 has a 48-bit password used to protect memory access. The tag can be configured to
            require or not require this password. If required, then read and write commands will require
            the reader to issue the correct 48-bit password. The lock command can be used to


                                                   A-1
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



               permanently write protect a block of memory. Mode 2 also has a 16-bit lock pointer which is
               located in unaddressable memory. The lock pointer points to a word in memory. All
               complete blocks of memory at addresses less than the number stored in the lock pointer
               cannot be overwritten.
 ISO/IEC 18000-4 covers systems operating at 2.45 GHz. This standard has two modes: a passive tag
  reader-talks-first mode and a battery assisted tag-talks-first mode.
 ISO/IEC 18000-5 was developed for 5.8 GHz operation but this standard was withdrawn.
 ISO/IEC 18000-6 defines three types of tags. Types A and B operate at 860 to 930 MHz, but they use
  different encoding and anti-collision methods on the forward channel. Type C is equivalent to the
  EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard.
 ISO/IEC 18000-7 is an RTF protocol for an RFID system that operates at 433 MHz. Tags have a 32-
  bit tag ID and a 16-bit manufacturer ID. Readers are given a 16-bit identifier as well. A 32-bit
  password can be set on the tags. A bit, referred to as the “secure bit” in the standard, is set to
  determine if the tag is password protected or not. If protected, read/write of the User ID, User ID
  Length, Routing Code, and memory are password protected. ISO/IEC 18000-7 supports optional
  command database query commands that are transmitted to all tags. The queries are sent in multiple
  steps and can use logical operators such as clear, and, and-or, and relational operators such as equal,
  less than, greater than, and not. Tags that receive all steps of the query will do an internal database
  search and readers can retrieve the results of these queries.
There are also a number of item management-related standards for the application of livestock tracking. 91

A.2       Industry Standards

The most prominent industry standards for RFID are the EPCglobal specifications and standards for
supply chain and patient safety applications. All EPCglobal specifications developed to date are for
passive, RTF RFID systems. Four specifications have been developed by EPCglobal: Class-0 UHF, the
Class-1 Generation-1 HF, the Class-1 Generation-1 UHF, and the Class-1 Generation-2 UHF
specifications. Of these specifications, the Class-1 Generation-2 specification has been approved by
EPCglobal as a standard.

The first specification developed by EPCglobal was the EPCglobal Class-0 specification for 900 MHz
UHF operation. The intent of this specification was to establish a low cost identification tag. The Class-0
specification provides three main features: an EPC, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), 92 and a self-
destruct feature. The self-destruct feature is also known as the kill feature. When a reader issues the kill
command and the appropriate 24-bit password, the tag no longer responds to any commands. 93 The Four
EPC identifiers described in the standard are shown in Table A-1.




91
      Livestock tracking standards include ISO 11784, ISO 11785, and ISO 14223. ISO 11784 covers the data format for such
      tags. ISO 11785 defines the technical details of such a tag, and ISO 14223 is an updated standard for livestock tracking
      tags.
92
      A cyclic redundancy check is used to detect errors such as those introduced by noise in a communication channel.

Next, two EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-1 specifications were developed: one for HF operation and one
for UHF operation. The HF specification defines a tag that operates at 13.56 MHz and has three main
features: an EPC, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check, and a self-destruct feature. Its kill code is 24 bits. 94
There currently are no commercial products based on the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-1 specification
for 13.56 MHz and nearly all references to EPC Class-1 Generation-1 tags refer to the UHF specification.
This is because 13.56 MHz offers operating ranges of up to one meter, which is not as useful in item
management as UHF, which can offer operating ranges of several meters. The UHF specification defines
a tag that operates at 860 MHz – 960 MHz and has an EPC identifier, an error detection code, and a kill
command. The EPC shall be a valid EPC that contains four subfields: a header, an EPC manager ID, an
object class, and a serial number. The error detection is performed using a 16-bit CRC. The kill
password is 8 bits. 95

The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard is the only specification that became a standard ratified by
EPCglobal. 96 The previous Class-0 and Class-1 Generation-1 tags are expected to be phased out and
replaced by Class-1 Generation-2 tags. It describes tags with five major features: an EPC, a tag identifier
(TID), a kill command, an optional password-protected access control, and an optional user memory. The
tag identifier is used to identify the design and features of the individual tag. This is necessary since tags
may have optional or custom commands and features. CRCs are used in some communications and for
the EPC. There is a 32-bit kill password and a 32-bit access password. The standard also implements a
lock command which can temporarily or permanently make an area of memory write-protected or read-
and-write protected. 97 EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags also use a cover-coding method to obscure
information that is sent from a reader to a tag. Cover-coding is explained in Section 5.3.2.1.

A.4      Proprietary Designs

Numerous companies have created their own proprietary RFID tag designs, many of which are based on
open standards. In the case of proprietary designs, readers of this document are encouraged to seek
information from the vendors about these products.

Two prominent examples of proprietary tags that are, in effect, proprietary extensions of open standards,
but offer extended features are item management tags and contactless smart cards. Item management tags
that are based on the air interface defined by ISO/IEC 18000-7 are widely used to monitor shipments of
cargo containers. US DoD uses these tags to track military cargo. Proprietary tags based on ISO/IEC
18000-7 operate at 433 MHz, can have a range of 100 meters, and can have user memory up to 128
kilobytes. Contactless smart cards are often based on ISO/IEC 14443 and are widely used in public
transportation and can also be used in access control, financial payment, gaming, loyalty card programs,
and toll road payment. Many contactless smart cards are enhanced with proprietary extensions and
security features.

Appendix B—Glossary

Selected terms used in Guidelines for Securing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Systems are
defined below.

Active Tag: A tag that relies on a battery for power.

Analytic Systems: IT systems that process the information outputs produced by middleware. Analytic
systems may be comprised of databases, data processing software, and Web services.

Authenticated RFID: The use of digital signature technology to provide evidence of the authenticity of a
tag and possibly chain of custody events.

Back Channel: The channel on which a tag transmits its signals.

Backscatter Channel: The type of back channel used by passive tags. Since passive tags do not have a
local power source, they communicate by reflecting or backscattering electromagnetic signals received
from a reader.

Cloned Tag: A tag that is made to be a duplicate of a legitimate tag. A cloned tag can be created by
reading data such as an identifier from a legitimate tag and writing that data to a different tag.

Closed System: A system that is self-contained within an enterprise. Closed systems do not have an
inter-enterprise subsystem.

Cover-Coding: A technique to reduce the risks of eavesdropping by obscuring the information that is
transmitted. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-6C standards use cover-coding to
obscure certain transmissions from readers to tags. A more detailed description of how cover-coding is
used in these two standards can be found in Section 5.3.2.1 on cover-coding.

Duty Cycle: The percentage of time that a device is operating over a specified period. For example, a
reader that is emitting energy to communicate with tags for 15 seconds every minute has a duty cycle of
25%.

Eavesdropper: A party that secretly receives communications intended for others.

Electronic Product Code (EPC) Identifier: One of the available formats for encoding identifiers on
RFID tags. The EPC is a globally unique number that identifies a specific item in the supply chain. This
number may be used to identify a container, pallet, case or individual unit.

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS): An inter-enterprise subsystem that facilitates
information sharing using the EPCglobal network. EPCISs provide information services necessary for
the storage, communication and dissemination of EPC data in a secure environment.

Enterprise Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that analyzes, processes, and stores information
collected by the RF subsystem. The primary role of the enterprise subsystem is to make the data collected
by the RF subsystem useful for a supporting business process. An enterprise subsystem is made up of
middleware, analytic systems, and network infrastructure.

Form Factor: The physical characteristics of a device or object including its size, shape, packaging,
handling, and weight.



                                                   B-1
GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Forward Channel: The channel on which a reader transmits its signals.

Inter-Enterprise Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that connects multiple enterprise
subsystems together. The inter-enterprise subsystem consists of network infrastructure, a naming service,
and possibly a discovery service. Inter-enterprise subsystems are most commonly associated with supply
chain applications.

Jamming: A deliberate communications disruption meant to degrade the operational performance of the
RF subsystem. Jamming is achieved by interjecting electromagnetic waves on the same frequency that
the reader to tag uses for communication.

Kill Command: A command that readers can send to tags that uses electronic disabling mechanisms to
prevent tags from responding to any additional commands.

Lock Command: A command that readers can send to a tag to block access to certain information on the
tag.

Lock Pointer: A memory pointer that points to a target area of memory and write protects all memory
locations less than the target location. This form of access control is implemented in ISO/IEC 18000-3.

Middleware: Software that aggregates and filters data collected by RFID readers and possibly passes the
information to an enterprise subsystem database. Middleware may also responsible for monitoring and
managing readers.

Minimalist Cryptography: Cryptography that can be implemented on devices with very limited
memory and computing capabilities, such as RFID tags.

Object Naming Service: An inter-enterprise subsystem for the EPCglobal Network that provides
network resolution services that direct EPC queries to the location where information associated with that
EPC can be accessed by authorized users.

Open System: A system that allows entities from different enterprises to access information related to
tags used in the system. Open systems use an inter-enterprise subsystem to share information between
entities.

Passive Tag: A tag that does not have its own power supply. Instead, it uses RF energy from the reader
for power. Due to the lower power, passive tags have shorter ranges than other tags, but are generally
smaller, lighter, and cheaper than other tags.

Permalock: A security feature that makes the lock status of an area of memory permanent. If the area of
memory is locked and permalocked, then that area is permanently locked. If the area of memory is
unlocked and permalocked, then that area is permanently unlocked.

Reader: A device that can wirelessly communicate with tags. Readers can detect the presence of tags as
well as send and receive data and commands from the tags.

Reader Spoofing: The act of impersonating a legitimate reader of an RFID system to read tags.

Reader Talks First: An RF transaction in which the reader transmits a signal that is received by tags in
its vicinity. The tags may be commanded to respond to the reader and continue with further transactions.

Reverse Channel: See back channel

RF Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that uses radio frequencies to perform identification and
related transactions. The RF subsystem consists of two components: a reader and a tag.

Semi-Active Tag: A tag that uses a battery to communicate but remains dormant until a reader sends an
energizing signal. Semi-active tags have a longer range than passive tags and a longer battery life than
active tags.

Semi-Passive Tag: A passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry or sensors but not to
produce back channel signals.

Shrinkage: Product loss or theft that results in declining revenue.

Singulation: A function performed by a reader to individually identify any tags in the reader’s operating
range.

Skimming: The unauthorized use of a reader to read tags without the authorization or knowledge of tag’s
owner or the individual in possession of the tag.

Smart Card: A plastic card containing a computer chip that enables the holder to purchase goods and
services, enter restricted areas, access medical, financial, or other records, or perform other operations
requiring data stored on the chip. 100

Supply Chain: The network of retailers, distributors, transporters, storage facilities, and suppliers that
participate in the sale, delivery, and production of a particular product. 101

Tag: An electronic device that communicates with RFID readers. A tag can function as a beacon or it
can be used to convey information such as an identifier.

Tag Talks First: An RF transaction in which the tag communicates its presence to a reader. The reader
may then send commands to the tag.

Traffic Analysis: The analysis of patterns in communications for the purpose of gaining intelligence
about a system or its users. Traffic analysis does not require examination of the content of the
communications, which may or may not be decipherable. For example, an adversary may be able to
detect a signal from a reader that could enable it to infer that a particular activity is occurring (e.g., a
shipment has arrived, someone is entering a facility) without necessarily learning an identifier or
associated data.

Transponder: See Tag

These general population / uncontrolled exposure limits are applicable in two situations. The first
situation is general public exposure. The second situation is when employees are exposed and are either
not fully aware of the potential for exposure or cannot control the exposure. The FCC also has published
maximum permissible exposure limits for occupational or controlled exposure.

      The letter f represents the frequency of the electromagnetic waves in MHz. The power density for the 0.3 – 1.34 MHz range
      and the 1.34 – 30 MHz range is a plane-wave equivalent power density. For more information, see FCC OET Bulletin 56,
