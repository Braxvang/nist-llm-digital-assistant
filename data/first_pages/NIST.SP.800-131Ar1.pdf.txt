                                           Abstract

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides cryptographic key
management guidance for defining and implementing appropriate key management procedures,
using algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information, and planning ahead for possible
changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks or the availability of more
powerful computing techniques. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-57 Part 1 includes a general
approach for transitioning from one algorithm or key length to another. This Recommendation
(SP 800-131A Revision 1) provides more specific guidance for transitions to the use of stronger
cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.

1          Introduction
1.1        Background and Purpose
At the beginning of the 21st century, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
began the task of providing cryptographic key management guidance. This included lessons
learned over many years of dealing with key management issues and is intended to 1) encourage
the specification and implementation of appropriate key management procedures, 2) use
algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information, and 3) plan ahead for possible changes
in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks or the availability of more powerful
computing techniques.
General key management guidance, including the general approach for transitioning from one
algorithm or key length to another, is addressed in Part 1 of Special Publication (SP) 800-57 [SP
800-57].
This Recommendation (SP 800-131A) is intended to provide more detail about the transitions
associated with the use of cryptography by Federal government agencies for the protection of
sensitive, but unclassified information. The Recommendation addresses the use of algorithms
and key lengths
SP 800-131A was originally published in January 2011. This revision updates the transition
guidance provided in the previous version; these changes are listed in Appendix C. The most
significant difference is the deprecation of the non-approved key-agreement and key-transport
schemes through December 31, 2017, and the intent to disallow them thereafter.
Although transition dates are provided in [SP 800-57], this document (i.e., SP 800-131A) is
intended to provide more detailed information that deals with the realities associated with an
orderly transition. Note that an upper-date limit is not provided herein for many of the algorithms
and key lengths discussed; that information is provided in [SP 800-57], and should be considered
valid unless different guidance is provided in the future.
1.2        Useful Terms for Understanding this Recommendation
1.2.1 Security Strengths
Some of the guidance provided in [SP 800-57] includes the definition of security strengths, the
association of the approved algorithms and key lengths with these security strengths, and a
projection of the time frames during which the algorithms and key lengths could be expected to
provide adequate security. Note that the length of the cryptographic keys is an integral part of
these determinations.
In [SP 800-57], the security strength provided by an algorithm with a particular key length 1 is
measured in bits and is a measure of the difficulty of subverting the cryptographic protection that
is provided by the algorithm and key. A security strength for each algorithm is provided in [SP

    The term “key size” is commonly used in other documents.



                                                         1
SP 800-131A Rev. 1                                                          Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic
                                                                                       Algorithms and Key Lengths

800-57]. This is the estimated maximum security strength that an algorithm with a particular key
length can provide, given that the key used with that algorithm has sufficient entropy 2.
The appropriate security strength to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data being
protected, and needs to be determined by the owner of that data (e.g., a person or an
organization). For the Federal government, a minimum security strength of 112 bits is required
for applying cryptographic protection (e.g., for encrypting or signing data). Note that prior to
2014, a security strength of 80 bits was approved for applying these protections, and the
transitions in this document reflect this change to a strength of 112 bits. However, a large
quantity of data was protected at the 80-bit security strength and may need to be processed (e.g.,
decrypted or have a digital signature verified). The processing of this already-protected data at
the lower security strength is allowed, but a certain amount of risk must be accepted.
Specific key lengths are provided in [FIPS 186-4] for DSA, ECDSA and RSA digital signatures,
in [SP 800-56A] for Diffie-Hellman and MQV key agreement, and in [SP 800-56B] for RSA key
agreement and key transport. These key lengths are strongly recommended for interoperability,
and their security strengths are provided in [SP 800-57]. However, other key lengths are
commonly used. The security strengths associated with these key lengths may be determined
using the formula provided in the [FIPS 140] Implementation Guideline [IG 7.5].
1.2.2 Definition of Terms
The terms “approved”, “acceptable”, “deprecated”, “restricted”, “legacy-use” and
"disallowed" are used throughout this Recommendation.
       •   Approved is used to mean that an algorithm is specified in a FIPS or NIST
           Recommendation (published as a NIST Special Publication).
       •   Acceptable is used to mean that the algorithm and key length is safe to use; no security
           risk is currently known.
       •   Deprecated means that the use of the algorithm and key length is allowed, but the user
           must accept some risk. The term is used when discussing the key lengths or algorithms
           that may be used to apply cryptographic protection to data (e.g., encrypting or generating
           a digital signature).
       •   Restricted means that the use of the algorithm or key length is deprecated, and there are
           additional restrictions required to use the algorithm or key length for applying
           cryptographic protection to data (e.g., encrypting).
       •   Legacy-use means that the algorithm or key length may be used to process already
           protected information (e.g., to decrypt ciphertext data or to verify a digital signature), but
           there may be a risk in doing so.
       •   Disallowed means that the algorithm or key length is no longer allowed for the indicated
           use.
The use of algorithms and key lengths for which the terms deprecated, restricted and legacy-use
are listed require that the user must accept some risk that increases over time. If a user
determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the algorithm or key length is considered

    Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder, randomness or variability in a closed system.

disallowed, from the perspective of that user. It is the responsibility of the user or the user’s
organization to determine the level of risk that can be tolerated for an application and its
associated data and to define any methods for mitigating those risks.

2        Encryption and Decryption Using Block Cipher Algorithms
Encryption is a cryptographic operation that is used to provide confidentiality for sensitive
information, and decryption is the inverse operation. Several block cipher algorithms have been
approved for use by the Federal government:
     •    TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm; often referred to as Triple DES) is specified
          in [SP 800-67], and has two variations, known as two-key TDEA and three-key TDEA.
          Three-key TDEA is the stronger of the two variations.
     •    SKIPJACK was approved in [FIPS 185]. However, approval for the use of SKIPJACK
          is being withdrawn, as its security strength is now considered inadequate.
     •    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is specified in [FIPS 197] and has three
          approved key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
See [SP 800-57] for more information about the security strengths provided by these algorithms.
Note that encryption and decryption using these algorithms require the use of modes of
operation. Some of these modes also provide authentication when performing encryption, and
provide verification when performing decryption on the encrypted and authenticated information
(see [SP 800-38C] and [SP 800-38D]).
The approval status of the block cipher encryption/decryption algorithms is provided in Table 1.

3        Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are used to provide assurance of origin authentication and data integrity.
These assurances are sometimes extended to provide assurance that a party in a dispute (the
signatory) cannot repudiate (i.e., refute) the validity of the signed document; this is commonly
known as non-repudiation. The digital signature algorithms approved in [FIPS 186-4] are DSA,
ECDSA and RSA.
The generation of a digital signature on data requires the use of 1) a cryptographic hash function
that operates on the data to be signed, and 2) the use of a cryptographic key and a signing
algorithm to generate a signature on the output of the hash function (and, by extension, the data
that is intended to be signed). This section addresses the use of the cryptographic keys used with
the signing algorithm. Discussions of the hash function to be used during the generation of
digital signatures are provided in Section 9. The details of the security strengths of the algorithms
and the key lengths used can be found in [SP 800-57].
Note that the security strength of a digital signature algorithm is no greater than the minimum of
1) the security strength that can be supported by the cryptographic keys used to generate
signatures, and 2) the security strength (with respect to collision resistance) of the cryptographic
hash function that operates on the data to be signed.
Table 2 provides the approval status of the algorithms and key lengths for the generation and
verification of digital signatures by the Federal government.

4      Random Bit Generation
Random numbers are used for various purposes, such as the generation of keys, nonces and
authentication challenges. Several deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) algorithms have
been approved for use by the Federal government. SP 800-90A [SP 800-90A] includes three
approved DRBG algorithms: HASH_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG and CTR_DRBG.
A previous version of [SP 800-90A] included a fourth algorithm, DUAL_EC_DRBG, whose use
is now disallowed for Federal applications. Several other algorithms that were previously
approved for random number generation are now deprecated and will be disallowed after 2015:
the random number generators specified in [FIPS 186-2], in American National Standard (ANS)
X9.31-1998 [X9.31] and in ANS X9.62-1998 [X9.62].
The current approval status for DRBGs is provided in Table 3.

RBGs that are compliant with the 2015 revision of SP 800-90A are acceptable for generating
random bits.
The use of the Dual_EC_DRBG is disallowed.
Through December 31, 2015, the use of the RNGs specified in FIPS 186-2, [X9.31] and the 1998
version of [X9.62] are deprecated. After 2015, these RNGs are disallowed.

5      Key Agreement Using Diffie-Hellman and MQV
Key agreement is a technique that is used to establish keying material between two entities that
intend to communicate, whereby both parties contribute information to the key agreement
process. Two families of key agreement schemes are defined and have been approved in [SP
800-56A]: Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV). Each has been defined over
two different mathematical structures: finite fields and elliptic curves. Key agreement includes
two steps: the use of an appropriate DH or MQV “primitive” to generate a shared secret, and the
use of a key derivation method (KDM) to generate one or more keys from the shared secret. [SP
800-56A] contains approved DH and MQV primitives and approved KDMs for key agreement.
Other key agreement schemes that are not specified in SP 800-56A are allowed by the
FIPS 140 Implementation Guideline [IG D.8]; these will be discussed below as the
deprecated schemes. They are disallowed after 2017.
Table 4 contains the approval status for DH and MQV key agreement schemes.

6      Key Agreement and Key Transport Using RSA
[SP 800-56B] specifies the use of RSA for both key agreement and key transport. Key agreement
is a technique in which both parties contribute information to the key agreement process. Key
transport is a key-establishment technique in which only one party determines the key. Some
protocols that include key transport schemes are listed in [IG D.9]; these will be discussed below
as the non-56B-compliant schemes. Note that in [IG D.9], key transport is often referred to as key
wrapping. Note also that, while there are allowed implementations of RSA-based Key Transport
schemes that are not compliant with [SP 800-56B], there are no approved or allowed RSA-based
Key Agreement schemes that are not compliant with [SP 800-56B].
Guidance on approved key lengths for RSA is provided in [SP 800-56B]. Table 6 provides the
approval status.
In the case of key transport keys (i.e., the keys used to encrypt other keys for transport), this
Recommendation (SP 800-131A) applies to both the encryption and decryption of the transported
keys.

7      Key Wrapping
Key wrapping is the encryption of keying material by a symmetric key with integrity protection.
[SP 800-38F] specifies three algorithms for key wrapping that use block ciphers: KW (AES Key
Wrap) and KWP (AES Key Wrap with Padding), which use AES, and TKW (Triple DEA Key
Wrap), which uses TDEA.
[SP 800-38F] also approves the CCM (Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message
Authentication Code) and GCM (Galois Counter Mode) authenticated-encryption modes
specified in [SP 800-38C] and [SP 800-38D] for key wrapping, as well as combinations of an
approved encryption mode with an approved authentication method.
Table 7 provides the approval status of the block cipher algorithms used for key wrapping.

    Through December 31, 2015, the use of two-key TDEA for key wrapping is restricted: the
    total number of blocks of data wrapped with the same cryptographic key shall not be greater
    than 220 (note that for this algorithm, a block is the 64-bit block of a TDEA encryption
    operation).
    Two-key TDEA shall not be used to wrap keying material after December 31, 2015.
    The use of two-key TDEA for unwrapping keying material using approved methods is
    allowed for legacy-use.

AES and three-key TDEA:
    AES and three-key TDEA are acceptable for both the wrapping and unwrapping of keying
    material using approved methods.

[SP 800-108] specifies key derivation functions that use a pre-shared cryptographic key (called a
key derivation key) to generate additional keys. Note that key derivation methods used within
key-agreement schemes are not relevant to this section.

9          Hash Functions
Seven approved hash functions are specified in [FIPS 180-4], and four additional approved
hash functions are specified in [FIPS 202]. The security strengths for hash functions are
dependent on their use, and this information is provided in [SP 800-57]. Additional discussions
about the different uses of the SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash functions specified in [FIPS 180-4] are
provided in [SP 800-107], while discussions about the SHA-3 hash functions specified in [FIPS

10      Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
Two types of message authentication code mechanisms using symmetric keys have been
approved for use: those based on hash functions, and those based on block-cipher algorithms.
[FIPS 198-1] specifies a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) that uses a hash
function; [SP 800-107] provides additional guidance on the uses of HMAC, whether using SHA-
1, SHA-2 or SHA-3. Block cipher modes for generating MACs are specified in [SP 800-38B]
and [SP 800-38D] 5. The CMAC (cipher-based MAC) mode specified in [SP 800-38B] uses
either AES or TDEA; the GMAC mode specified in [SP 800-38D] uses AES.
Figure 10 provides the approval status for the approved MAC algorithms.

Appendix A: Mitigating Risk When Using Algorithms and Keys for
Legacy-Use
Certain algorithms and key sizes are allowed for legacy-use when removing or verifying the
cryptographic protection already applied to sensitive information (e.g., decrypting ciphertext or
verifying a digital signature or message authentication code). However, a user must accept that
the protection of the information may no longer be as strong as desired.

A.1        Decryption and Key Unwrapping Using Block Cipher Key Algorithms (e.g.,
           Two-key TDEA)
Sensitive information may continue to need confidentiality protection beyond the date when the
algorithm and key length used to protect that information are no longer considered adequate.

Block cipher algorithms use the same key for encryption to produce ciphertext data as must be
used to decrypt the ciphertext data back to the original plaintext data. However, since the
algorithm and key length used to encrypt the information are no longer considered secure, those
entities using the algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext data should consider that an adversary may
be capable of determining the key that was used for encryption. If the adversary has access to the
ciphertext data and can determine the key, then the data no longer has reliable confidentiality
protection. That is, the owner of the sensitive information should consider the information to no
longer be protected (i.e., the information should be considered as being in plaintext form).
Several scenarios need to be considered when evaluating whether or not the information is or
will remain secure.

       1. If the ciphertext information was made available to an adversary (e.g., the ciphertext was
          transmitted over the Internet), the ciphertext may have been recorded by the adversary. In
          such a case, there is a possibility that the adversary can determine the key for decrypting
          the ciphertext, thus exposing the sensitive information. The remaining items assume that
          this situation is not the case or that the probability is sufficiently low that other measures
          to further protect the information are warranted.

       2. If the ciphertext data is protected from exposure to potential attack (e.g., the ciphertext
          data is saved in secure storage), then the confidentiality of the information as encrypted
          using the now-insecure algorithm or key length may remain valid.

       3. If the ciphertext data was previously protected from attack (see item 2 above), but needs
          to be made publicly available (e.g., transmitted) during the period in which the algorithm
          and key length are only allowed for legacy-use, then the information must be re-
          encrypted or super-encrypted 6 using a more secure algorithm and key length.

A.2        Verification of Message Authentication Codes (MACs) Using CMAC
A message authentication code (MAC) may need to remain verifiable and valid beyond the date
when the algorithm and key length used to generate the MAC are no longer considered adequate.

    The ciphertext is encrypted or wrapped using an additional algorithm and key.

                                                                           Algorithms and Key Lengths

As in the case of block cipher algorithms used for encryption, the same key is used to generate
the MAC as must be used for verification of that MAC. Since the algorithm and key length used
to generate that MAC are no longer considered secure, an entity that verifies a MAC using a no-
longer-secure algorithm and key length should assume that an adversary may be capable of
determining the key that was used for MAC generation. During the “legacy-use” period, the
adversary may be assumed to be capable of determining the MAC key and generating MACs on
new messages or substituting more beneficial messages (beneficial to the adversary) that produce
the same MAC.

In order for the MACed data to continue to be verifiable as valid during the “legacy-use” period,
both the MACed data and the MAC need to be protected against possible modification or
substitution (e.g., placed in secure storage).

A.3    Digital Signature Verification Using Asymmetric (Public) Keys
The rules specified in this publication require that digital signatures are generated using keys that
provide at least 112 bits of security strength. However, before the end of 2013, the use of keys
that provided only 80 bits of security strength was approved.

While it is possible to disallow the use of the low-strength keys and hash functions when
generating new signatures, it is also necessary to deal with the existence of a large set of already-
generated signatures that need to be verified. Hence, this publication specifies different feasible
strengths of keys and an unlimited use of the SHA-1 hash function when it is used for digital
signature verification of previously approved key lengths.

There are, however, risks involved that must be understood by the verifying user. The signature
verification procedure might work, but since the document was signed by a key that is now
considered weak, its integrity and the authenticity of the signatory could be compromised. For
example, an attacker might be able to use the signatory’s public key and the publicly known set
of domain parameters and determine the private key used for signature generation, due to its low
security strength. The attacker could then alter the original document and sign it using the
discovered private key. Other related attacks are also possible.

Therefore, while it is necessary to allow the use of weaker keys to verify the existing signatures,
it is also important to remind the user to remember the risk of verifying the wrong one.

Appendix C: Summary of Changes Between this Version of SP 800-
131A and the Previous Version
The following is a list of non-editorial changes from the 2011 version of this document. Changes
indicated by a yellow highlight are entirely new requirements (the changes were not reflected in
the previous version of SP 800-131A.
   1. The use of two-key TDEA for applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption, key
      wrapping or CMAC generation in KDFs) is restricted through December 31, 2015. Its use
      for processing already-protected information (e.g., decryption, key unwrapping and MAC
      verification) is allowed for legacy use.
   2. The use of SKIPJACK is disallowed for encryption, but allowed for legacy use (e.g.,
      decryption of already encrypted information).
   3. Section 1.2.3 was added to define the single symbol used in this Recommendation:
      len(x); this has been used to replace |p|, |q|, |n| and |h|, rather than defining them in
      footnotes.
   4. The use of keys that provide less than 112 bits of security strength for digital signature
      generation are no longer allowed; however, their use for digital signature verification is
      allowed for legacy use (i.e., the verification of already-generated digital signatures). For
      digital signature verification using DSA, the legacy-use row has been specified to reflect
      the lower bound that was specified in FIPS 186-2 (i.e., 512 bits).
   5. The use of the DUAL_EC_DRBG, formerly specified in [SP 800-90A], is no longer
      allowed.
   6. The use of the RNGs specified in [FIPS 186-2], [X9.31] and [X9.62] is deprecated until
      December 31, 2015, and disallowed thereafter.
   7. The use of keys that provide less than 112 bits of security strength for key agreement is
      now disallowed.
   8. The use of non-approved key-agreement schemes is deprecated through December 31,
      2017, and disallowed thereafter.
   9. The use of non-approved key-transport schemes is deprecated through December 31,
      2017, and is disallowed thereafter.
   10. Non-approved key-wrapping methods are disallowed after December 31, 2017.
   11. The use of SHA-1 for digital signature generation is disallowed (except where
       specifically allowed in NIST protocol-specific guidance); however, its use for digital
       signature verification is allowed for legacy use (i.e., the verification of already-generated
       digital signatures).
   12. The SHA-3 family of hash functions specified in [FIPS 202] has been included in Section
       9 as acceptable.
   13. The use of HMAC keys less than 112 bits in length is no longer allowed for the
       generation of a MAC; however, they may be used for legacy use (i.e., the verification of
       already-generated MACs).
