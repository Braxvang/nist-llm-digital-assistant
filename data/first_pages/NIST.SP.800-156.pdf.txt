1     Introduction

1.1   Background

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD12] called for a common
identification standard to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity
credentials to allow physical and logical access to federal government locations and
systems. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], “Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,” was developed as the
standard for the identity credentials hosted on a smart card called the PIV Card.
[FIPS201] defines the identity proofing, registration, and issuance requirements for
issuing PIV Cards to Federal Government employees and contractors.

Data collected during identity proofing, registration, and issuance may be maintained in a
chain-of-trust record. As per FIPS 201-2, “a card issuer may optionally maintain, for each
PIV Card issued, a documentary chain-of-trust for the identification data it collects. The
chain-of-trust is a sequence of related enrollment data records that are created and
maintained through the methods of contemporaneous acquisition of data within each
enrollment data record, and biometric matching of samples between enrollment data
records.”

The chain-of-trust offers process efficiencies because a PIV Card can be re-issued based
on the most current chain-of-trust record, and more importantly, can avoid having to
repeat the identity proofing and re-registration (re-enrollment) process. Departments and
agencies that implement a chain-of-trust will also be able to transfer the record to another
agency or to a service provider, so that the receiving agency or service provider can use
the record to issue a PIV Card rather than re-enroll an applicant. This Special Publication
provides the representation of a chain-of-trust for import and export between PIV Card
issuers.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

[FIPS201] describes three use cases for a chain-of-trust: 1) to extend enrollment, 2) to re-
issue a PIV Card, and 3) to transfer PIV Card enrollment records to another federal issuer
or to a service provider. The purpose of this document is to provide the data
representation of a chain-of-trust record for the transferal use case. The data
representation is based on a common XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema to
facilitate interoperable information sharing and data exchange. The sending and receiving
federal agencies will be able to exchange the chain-of-trust data according to the
specifications provided in this document. Similarly, a service provider will be able to
receive chain-of-trust records from different client agencies that are based on a common
XML schema specified in this document. This document also provides support for data
integrity through digital signatures and for confidentiality through encryption of chain-of-
trust data, in transit and at rest.




                                             1
NIST SP 800-156                                                REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                             FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


There are two use cases within the transferal scenario which this document supports:

Agency to agency: In this use case, an existing PIV cardholder from agency A is
transferring to agency B, where he/she will require a new PIV Card issued by agency B.
Rather than re-enrolling the user, the chain-of-trust record is sent, (upon Agency B’s
request) from agency A to agency B such that agency B is able to reuse the enrollment
data, thus reducing the time and effort required for agency B to issue a new PIV Card.

Agency to service provider: In this use case, an agency does not directly issue PIV Cards
to their employees and contractors, but instead utilizes a separate service provider for
issuance of PIV Cards. The agency can use the chain-of-trust to send PIV Card
enrollment data collected by the agency to the service provider.

It is anticipated that more optional elements will be populated in the chain-of-trust XML
record for the agency to service provider use case than the agency to agency use case. In
the agency to service provider exchange, the agency is likely to indicate several optional
elements that are not applicable in the agency to agency use case. Examples of these
elements include those that would be printed on a card and are provided by the agency to
the service provider, such as <EmployeeAffiliation>,
<AgencyDepartmentOrOrganization>, <AffiliationColorCode>, and <Rank>.

Regardless of the use case, the goal is to provide a common chain-of-trust schema to
facilitate information sharing and data exchange between different issuers.

2         Chain-of-Trust Data Requirements and Namespaces

[FIPS201] recommends that the following data be included in the chain-of-trust:

          A log of activities that documents who took the action, what action was taken,
           when and where the action took place, and what identification data was collected.

          An enrollment data record that contains the most recent collection of each of the
           biometric data collected. The enrollment data record describes the circumstances
           of biometric acquisition including the name and role of the acquiring agent, the
           office and organization, time, place, and acquisition method. The enrollment data
           record may also document unavailable biometric data or failed attempts to collect
           biometric data. The enrollment data record may contain historical biometric data.

          The most recent unique identifiers (i.e., Federal Agency Smart Credential Number
           (FASC-N) and Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)) issued to the individual’s
           card. The record may contain historical unique identifiers.

          Information about the authorizing entity who has approved the issuance of a
           credential.

          Current status of the background investigation, including the results of the
           investigation once completed.

          The evidence of authorization if the credential is issued under a pseudonym.

          Any data or any subsequent changes in the data about the cardholder. If the
           changed data is the cardholder’s name, then the issuer should include the evidence
           of a formal name change.

The following sections provide an XML schema representation of the baseline data
included in the chain-of-trust.

This schema has been authored to address the broadest envisioned range of chain-of-trust
data to be able to transfer PIV Card enrollment records across federal agencies and to a
service provider. Users of this XML schema may extend the schema as needed.
Extending the XML schema will allow the exchange of additional elements to meet
requirements for specialized exchange of chain-of-trust data. However, extending the
XML schema will also result in custom exchange that is less interoperable.

2.1       Namespaces Declaration for Chain-of-Trust Schema

XML namespace prefixes are used throughout this specification to stand for their
respective namespaces as follows:

3     Chain-of-Trust Schema Description

The chain-of-trust data is encoded in the XML format specified in this document. The
chain-of-trust XML records are intended to be used in a direct-exchange. While log and
historical data are not included in the XML chain-of-trust record, the issuer of the chain-
of-trust record should be able to correlate the chain-of-trust record to the associated log
and historic data, if requested to do so by the recipient of the chain-of-trust record. The
<PIVTrustChain> element may include the records for multiple subjects, with each
<EnrollmentRecord> element containing the record for a single subject.

This section contains an overview of the elements that may appear in a chain-of-trust
XML file.

3.1   Schema Header and Namespace Declarations

The following schema fragment defines the XML namespaces and other header
information for the PIV chain-of-trust schema:

3.2   Element <PIVChainOfTrust>

The following schema fragment defines the <PIVChainOfTrust> element:
<xs:element name="PIVChainOfTrust" type="PIVChainOfTrustType"/>


The <PIVChainOfTrust> element is of PIVChainOfTrustType complex type, and
carries one or more <EnrollmentRecord> elements.

3.3   Complex Type PIVChainOfTrustType

The following schema fragment defines the PIVChainOfTrustType complex type:

      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element ref="xenc:EncryptedData" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>

                                                                             FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT

</xs:complexType>


The PIVChainOfTrustType complex type offers a choice to either encrypt the PIV
chain-of-trust records, or to leave the record unencrypted. PIV chain-of-trust records
contain personally identifiable information (PII) of actual PIV cardholders and thus shall
always be encrypted when in transit. The unencrypted sequence is intended to allow a
recipient of the record to validate/test XML records as required. The recipient of the
record should protect the records accordingly when not in use (i.e., data at rest
protection).

Each instance of the <EnrollmentRecord> element contains the enrollment information
captured by the PIV issuer for a single PIV cardholder. There is a minimum of one
instance of this element, and there is no limit to the maximum number of
<EnrollmentRecord> elements that may be contained in the <PIVChainOfTrust>
element. This allows a single instance of the <PIVChainOfTrust> element to contain
several PIV cardholder records in an XML file.

Encrypted PIV chain-of-trust records are intended to include a confidentiality protection
mechanism. The encrypted content and associated encryption details are defined by the
XML Encryption Syntax and Processing specification [XMLEnc]. The <EncryptedData>
Type attribute should be present and contain a value of
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element. The encryption method algorithm for the
<EncryptedData> element should be set to: http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-
cbc.

The <xenc:EncryptedKey> element is defined in the [XMLEnc] standard and used to
transport encrypted symmetric keys from the originator to a known recipient(s). The
symmetric key value is always encrypted to the recipient(s). A public key from a PKI
certificate should be used to encrypt the symmetric key. The sender should select an
encryption certificate for the recipient issued under a policy that has been cross-certified
with the Federal Bridge CA (FBCA) at the Medium Hardware or High Assurance Level.
The sender should use http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p as the key
transport algorithm to encrypt the key. Each encrypted key should include a Recipient
attribute that contains a hint as to which recipient the encrypted key value is intended for.
An example value that could be used in the Recipient attribute is the distinguished name
(DN) from the recipient’s encryption certificate subject field.

A procedure for the exchange of the key encryption key is outside the scope of this
document. Some example mechanisms for this exchange include the use of
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) email exchanges to share the
encryption certificates, or a webpage that supports Hyper Text Transfer Protocol with
Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS) using an FPKI SSL certificate or an Extended Validation
Secure Sockets Layer (EVSSL) certificate, where links to the encryption certificates for
recipient federal agencies or service providers can be accessed and downloaded.

All PIV chain-of-trust records are signed using XML Signature. An XML Signature
protects the integrity of the data and authenticates the issuer of the chain-of-trust. A valid

                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


PIV Card or a private key generated under the id-fpki-common-piv-contentSigning
certificate policy should be used to sign the XML record.

3.4     Complex Type EnrollmentRecordType

The following schema fragment defines the EnrollmentRecordType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="EnrollmentRecordType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="PersonalInformation" type="PersonalInformationType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="AdjudicationInformation" type="AdjudicationInformationType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="EnrollmentPackage" type="EnrollmentPackageType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="PIVCardTopography" type="PIVCardTopographyType" minOccurs="0"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The EnrollmentRecordType complex type contains four elements carrying data
required for the issuance of a PIV Card to the cardholder. The elements contained in the
EnrollmentRecordType complex type are:

      <PersonalInformation>:
            This element is an instance of the PersonalInformationType complex type
            and contains personally identifying information on the subject of the chain-of-
            trust enrollment record. The <PersonalInformation> element is a required
            element that appears once in the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

      <AdjudicationInformation>:
            This element is an instance of the AdjudicationInformationType complex
            type and contains information on the status of the background investigation
            into the subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. The
            <AdjudicationInformation> element is a required element that appears once in
            the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

      <EnrollmentPackage>:
             This element is an instance of the EnrollmentPackageType complex type
             and contains biographic and biometric information on the subject of the chain-
             of-trust enrollment record. The <EnrollmentPackage> element is a required
             element that appears once in the EnrollmentPackageType complex type.

      <PIVCardTopography>:
           This element is an instance of the PIVCardTopographyType complex type
           and contains information used for the physical printing of PIV Cards. The
           <PIVCardTopography> element is an optional element. If used, it would
           appear once in the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

The EnrollmentRecordType for an agency to agency record exchange use case would
typically include the following types:


                                                8
NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


          PersonalInformationType
          AdjudicationInformationType
          EnrollmentPackageType

The EnrollmentRecordType for an agency to service provider record exchange use case
would typically include the following types:

          PersonalInformationType
          AdjudicationInformationType
          EnrollmentPackageType
          PIVCardTopographyType

As indicated above, the PIVCardTopographyType data element is more likely to be
included in the service provider record exchange use case rather than the agency to
agency record exchange use case. This is because a client agency needs to provide
information about its agency and its new employees/contractors to be printed on the
surface of each card. For the agency to agency record exchange, topographic information
may not be needed as the receiving agency will use its own topographic elements when
printing on the PIV Card.

3.5       Complex Type PersonalInformationType

The following schema fragment defines the PersonalInformationType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="PersonalInformationType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="PrimaryIdentifier" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="SecondaryIdentifier" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="PrintedName" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="SSN" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="IsUSCitizen" type="xs:boolean" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CitizenshipCountryCode" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    <xs:element name="CardHolderUUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CardUUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CHUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The CardUUID and CHUID type data element generally is not included in the agency to
agency record exchange use case as the new agency will generate these values. For the
agency to servicer provider record exchange, however, the client agency may wish to
specify the CardUUID and CHUID for each PIV cardholder.

The PersonalInformationType complex type contains eight elements that describe the
subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. Those elements are:

      <PrimaryIdentifier>:
            This element contains the Primary Identifier of the subject of the chain-of-
            trust enrollment record. The Primary Identifier is defined in [FIPS201] as the
            surnames or family names of the PIV cardholder. The <PrimaryIdentifier>
            element is always included in the PersonalInformationType complex type

                                                                            FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


           and appears only once. The data is provided in an xs:string format.

    <SecondaryIdentifier>:
          This element contains the Secondary Identifier of the subject of the chain-of-
          trust enrollment record. The Secondary Identifier is defined in [FIPS201] as
          pre-names or given names of the PIV Cardholder. The <SecondaryIdentifier>
          element is always included in the PersonalInformationType complex type
          and occurs only once. The data is provided in an xs:string format.

    <PrintedName>:
           This element contains the Printed Name of the subject of the chain-of-trust
           enrollment record. The Printed Name is a combination of the card holder’s
           primary and secondary identifiers, as it is to be printed on the PIV Card
           according to [FIPS201]. The <PrintedName> element is always included in
           the PersonalInformationType complex type and only occurs once. The data
           is provided in an xs:string format.

    <SSN>:
         This element may contain the Social Security Number of the subject of the
         chain-of-trust enrollment record.1 The <SSN> element is optional, and may
         occur only once if included in the PersonalInformationType complex type.
         The data is provided in an xs:string format.

    <IsUSCitizen>:
          This element is required, occurs once in the PersonalInformationType
          complex type and contains a boolean value. If the subject of the chain-of-trust
          enrollment record is a U.S. Citizen, then the value is set to true. If the subject
          of the chain-of-trust enrollment record is not a U.S. Citizen, then the value is
          set to false. The data is provided in an xs:boolean format. If the
          <IsUSCitizen> element is false, then at least one country is specified in
          <CitizenshipCountryCode>.

    <CitizenshipCountryCode>:
           This element is required if <IsUSCitizen> is set to false and optional if
           <IsUSCitizen> is set to true. The element contains the countries of citizenship
           of the subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. The country code is
           formatted in an abbreviation (alpha-3 format), as documented in [ISO3166].
           The <CitizenshipCountryCode> element may occur once for each citizenship
           the applicant possesses. The data is provided in an xs:string format.




1To eliminate unnecessary use of the SSN, whenever possible, departments and agencies should
avoid using the <SSN> element. See the attachment to OMB M-07-16 [M-07-16], Section 2:
“Reduce the Use of Social Security Numbers.”

      <CardHolderUUID>:
            The <CardHolderUUID > element is optional, and occurs once when included
            in the PersonalInformationType complex type. The Cardholder UUID is is a
            persistent identifier for the cardholder. The data is provided in an xs:string
            format. <CardHolderUUID> can be used by Agency B to request record from
            Agency A. The user then re-connects with the record via a biometric match.

      <CardUUID>:
            The <CardUUID > element is optional, and occurs once when included in the
            PersonalInformationType complex type. It is envisioned that the
            <CardUUID> will be used only in the agency to service provider record
            exchange use case to transfer the Card UUID to be stored on the PIV Card.
            The data is provided in an xs:string format. <CardUUID> can be used by
            Agency B to request a record from Agency A. The user then re-connects with
            the record via a biometric match.

      <CHUID>:
           This element is optional and if used should occur once when included in the
           PersonalInformationType complex type. It is envisioned that the <CHUID>
           will be used only in the agency to service provider use case to transfer the
           CHUID-specific details to be stored on the PIV Card. The data is provided in
           an xs:string format. <CHUID>’s FASC-N can be used by Agency B to request
           a record from Agency A. The user then re-connects with the record via a
           biometric match.

3.6     Complex Type AdjudicationInformationType

The following schema fragment defines the AdjudicationInformationType complex
type:
<xs:complexType name="AdjudicationInformationType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="NACIAdjudicationValue" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
      <xs:simpleType>
        <xs:restriction base="xs:string">

          <xs:enumeration value="Pending"/>
        </xs:restriction>
      </xs:simpleType>
    </xs:element>
    <xs:element name="NACIAdjudicationEffDate" type="xs:date" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The AdjudicationInformationType complex type contains two elements that describe
the status of the PIV background investigation of the subject of the chain-of-trust
enrollment record. Those elements are:

      <NACIAdjudicationValue>:
           This element is required, and occurs once in the
           AdjudicationInformationType complex type. The element indicates the
           status of the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) (or equivalent or

             higher) or Tier 1 or higher federal background investigation the PIV
             cardholder underwent. There are two permitted values based on the progress
             of the background investigation. The element is set to ‘Approved’ or
             ‘Pending.’ ‘Approved’ indicates a NACI (or equivalent or higher) or Tier 1 or
             higher federal background investigation has been completed. ‘Pending’ status
             indicates the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Criminal History
             Check (NCHC) portion of the background investigation is completed and that
             NACI background check is in process, but has not yet received final
             adjudication. The data is provided in an xs:string format.

      <NACIAdjudicationEffDate>:
           This element is optional, and occurs once when included in the
           AdjudicationInformationType complex type. The element indicates the date
           the current status of the <NACIAdjudicationValue> element went into effect.
           The data is provided in an xs:date format.

3.7     Complex Type EnrollmentPackageType

The following schema fragment defines the EnrollmentPackageType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="EnrollmentPackageType">

    <xs:element name="EPDocument" type="EPDocumentType" minOccurs="2" maxOccurs="2"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The EnrollmentPackageType complex type contains three elements that identify the
biographic and biometric properties of a PIV cardholder. The elements contained in the
EnrollmentPackageType complex type are:

      <EPBiographic>:
            This element is an instance of the EPBiographicType complex type,
            containing biographic information on the subject of the chain-of-trust
            enrollment record as described in Section 3.8. The <EPBiographic> element is
            an optional element and if present, appears once in the
            EnrollmentPackageType complex type.

      <EPBiometrics>:
            This element is an instance of the EPBiometricsType complex type,
            containing biometric information on the subject of the chain-of-trust
            enrollment record as described in Section 3.9. The < EPBiometrics> element
            is a required element that appears once in the EnrollmentPackageType
            complex type.

      <EPDocument>:
           This element is an instance of the EPDocumentType complex type as

4     Chain-of-trust Record Encryption in Transit

The confidentiality of the chain-of-trust record is to be protected at all times by both the
producing and consuming organizations. In addition to encrypting the chain-of-trust
record in accordance with XML encryption, as documented in Section 3.3 for
PIVChainOfTrustType, the chain-of-trust records should be encrypted in transit between
the chain-of-trust producer and the chain-of-trust consumer. Some example mechanisms
for chain-of-trust transmission include but are not limited to: FTPS, HTTPS secured web
services, and out of band mechanisms such as S/MIME secure email. The encryption
used shall be compliant with the [FIPS140] standard.

5     Log and Historical Data

Logs and historical data are maintained by the original issuer and are not transferred
when exchanging PIV Card enrollment records. These log and historical data were
created by the original issuer and are part of the chain-of-trust record. Log and historical
data contain information that correlates the subject of a chain-of-trust record to logs of
identity proofing, registration (enrollment) and maintenance activities of a cardholder.
This includes information about the officer who took the action, what action was taken,
and when and where the action occurred. Some examples of log activities maintained in
the chain-of-trust record log are: initial PIV Cardholder registration, enrollment, and
issuance, change of name and subsequent re-issuance, loss of card and subsequent
reissuance.

Appendix D—Glossary of Terms

Biometric         The stored electronic information pertaining to a biometric. This
                  information can be in terms of compressed pixels or in terms of
                  some characteristic (e.g., patterns).

Cardholder        An individual possessing an issued PIV Card.

Chain-of-trust    The chain-of-trust is a sequence of related enrollment data sets that
                  is created and maintained by PIV Card issuers

FASC-N            Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N): As required
                  by [FIPS201], one of the primary identifiers on the PIV Card. The
                  FASC-N is a fixed length (25-byte) data object, specified in [SP800-
                  73-4], and included in several data objects on a PIV Card.

Issuer            An agency or service provider that issues PIV credentials in
                  accordance with [FIPS201] and NIST [SP 800-79-2].

Off-Card          A cardholder’s biometric reference data stored on the PIV Card that
                  is matched against the cardholder’s life-scan biometrics Off-Card
                  during authentication.
                  A cardholder’s biometric reference data stored on the PIV Card that
On-Card
                  is matched against the cardholder’s life-scan biometrics On-Card
                  during authentication.
