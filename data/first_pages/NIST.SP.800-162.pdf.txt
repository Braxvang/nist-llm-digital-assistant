This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law (P.L.) 107-347. NIST is responsible for
developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for Federal
information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems
without the express approval of appropriate Federal officials exercising policy authority over such
systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-
130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in Circular A-130,
Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

 Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to
 describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
 recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or
 equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
 There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
 accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including
 concepts and methodologies, may be used by Federal agencies even before the completion of such
 companion publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and
 procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For planning and transition purposes, Federal agencies may
 wish to closely follow the development of these new publications by NIST.
 Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide
 feedback to NIST. All NIST Computer Security Division publications, other than the ones noted above, are
 available at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications.

                                                                                             concept of policies that express a complex Boolean rule set that can evaluate many different attributes.
                                                                                             While it is possible to achieve ABAC objectives using ACLs or RBAC, demonstrating AC requirements

                                                                                             requester, the assigned attributes of the object, environment conditions, and a set of policies that are

                                                                                             attributes or attribute values that are named differently. For example, one organization may use the name
                                                                                             Citizenship and another may use the name Nationality to refer to the same set of attribute values.

                                                                                             In practice, cross-organizational ABAC may follow a collaborative approach outlined in Sections 3.1.3.1

                                                                                             assurance of appropriate control between organizations. When new policies are created, if policy authors
