EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), dated August 27, 2004, established a
policy for creation, issuance, and use of personal identification credentials in the Federal
government. The Directive requires the development and use of a standard for a secure and
reliable form of identification for Federal employees and contractors. The Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) specifications of the resulting standard are to be used as a foundation for
securely identifying every individual seeking access to valuable and sensitive Federal resources,
including buildings, information systems, and computer networks. The implementation of PIV
specifications will, in turn, involve operations such as the collection, access protection, and
dissemination of large amounts of personal information, which itself requires privacy protection.

NIST developed and published the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1,
entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, as well as several
NIST Special Publications (SPs) providing additional specifications and supporting information
in response to HSPD-12. These documents provide the required foundation for standardizing the
processes relating to adoption and use of government-wide personal identification credentials
and the issuance of PIV smart cards as a means to verify the identity of the credential holders.

In light of the requirements for both improved security and protection of personal privacy,
HSPD-12 established four control objectives, one of which includes the call for a form of
identification that is “issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
accreditation process.” In response, Appendix B of FIPS 201-1 specified that NIST “…establish
a government-wide program to accredit official issuers of PIV Cards…,” which led to
development of this NIST SP, entitled Guidelines for the Accreditation of Personal Identity
Verification Card Issuers.

The purpose of this SP is to provide appropriate and useful guidelines for accrediting the
reliability of issuers of Personal Identity Verification cards that are established to collect, store,
and disseminate personal identity credentials and issue smart cards, based on the standards
published in response to HSPD-12. These issuers, who are the target of assessment and
accreditation, are called Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers or PCIs. The reliability of
PCIs is of utmost importance when one organization (e.g., a Federal agency or Federal
contractor) is required to trust the identity credentials and cards of individuals that were created
and issued, respectively, by another organization. This trust will only exist if organizations
relying on the credentials and cards issued by a given organization have the necessary level of
assurance that the reliability of the issuing organization has been established through a formal
accreditation process.

This SP provides an assessment and accreditation methodology for verifying that issuers of PIV
credentials and cards are reliably adhering to standards and implementation directives developed
under HSPD-12. The salient features of the methodology are:

    (i)     Controls derived from specific requirements in FIPS 201-1 and relevant documents
            for PCIs;




                                                   1
   (ii)      Procedures for assessing and monitoring adherence to the requirements through a
             determination of control implementation; and
   (iii)     Guidance for evaluating the result of an assessment in order to arrive at the
             accreditation decision.

Arriving at an accreditation decision that authorizes a PCI to operate establishes the reliability of
that PCI.

Accreditation is one a basis for establishing trust of PCIs and requires that all assessment and
accreditation processes be thorough and comprehensive. Careful planning, preparation, and
commitment of time, energy, and resources are required. These guidelines are designed to assist
agencies in creating the needed roles, assigning responsibilities, developing an acceptable
operations plan, drawing a PCI’s accreditation boundary, evaluating the findings of all reliability
assessments, and making a proper decision for accrediting the PCI. Realizing that organizations
may vary significantly in how they choose to structure their PCI operations, these guidelines
have been developed to support organizational flexibility, and are designed to minimize the
effort needed to assess, accredit, and monitor the continued reliability of a PCI.

In addition to flexibility and efficiency, the accreditation methodology defined in these
guidelines generates assessment findings and resulting accreditation decisions that are consistent
and repeatable. These characteristics provide assurance to an organization’s management that
when a PCI has been accredited based on these guidelines, the target of accreditation can be
trusted as a provider of secure and reliable identification credentials as required by HSPD-12.

This document shall be used by both small and large organizations where processes performed
by their PCIs relating to PIV Card issuance are:
   •      Centrally located;
   •      Geographically dispersed; or
   •      Outsourced in varying degrees to another organization(s) or service provider(s).




                                                  2
1. INTRODUCTION
In order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect
personal privacy, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12),
Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated
August 27, 2004. This Directive established a Federal policy to create and use a government-
wide secure and reliable form of identification for Federal employees and contractors. It further
defined secure and reliable identification as one that—

   •   Is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
   •   Is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation;
   •   Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
   •   Is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
       accreditation process.

NIST developed and published Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1, entitled
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, and several Special
Publications providing additional specifications and supporting information in response to
HSPD-12. These documents provide the foundation for Government personal identification,
verification, and access control systems.

Appendix B.1 of FIPS 201-1 states the following:

 “… [HSPD-12] requires that all cards be issued by providers whose reliability has been
established by an official accreditation process. Funding permitting, NIST will establish detailed
criteria that PIV Card Issuers must meet for accreditation. Additionally, NIST will (again,
funding permitting) establish a government-wide program to accredit official issuers of PIV
Cards against these accreditation criteria. Until such time as these are completed, agencies must
self-certify their own issuers of PIV Cards...”

In order to satisfy HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-1, NIST undertook the development of the Guidelines
for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV Card Issuers and published them as NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-79. This document is the first revision to the original. The revised SP 800-
79-1 provides a more technically-based approach to assure that a PCI is fulfilling all the
requirements of FIPS 201-1 and its supporting documents, and doing so reliably. In this revised
document, a PCI is considered to be owned and managed by an organization which may be a
Federal department, agency, state or local government, private entity, or other enterprise that
desires to issue reliable PIV Cards. Ensuring the reliability of a PCI is of critical importance in
light of the security and privacy implications of HSPD-12 and its far-reaching objective of
issuing PIV Cards to millions of employees and contractors. HSPD-12 and its implementing
standards and guidelines were developed to address a range of security concerns, including those
posed by terrorists in a post-9/11 world. Providing a comprehensive set of standards for
controlling access to the physical and logical resources through the use of a standard PIV Card
assures that certain pre-defined levels of security can be achieved. However, it requires
organizations to implement and use the standards in a consistent and reliable manner.



                                                  3
An organization must have confidence in the cards it issues to its own employees and
contractors, but possibly more importantly, since HSPD-12 requires a common inter-operable
standard, all organizations need to have confidence in the cards issued by other organizations.
This confidence can come about only if the PCI functions in those other organizations are
assessed and accredited. Thus, PCI accreditation forms an important task in meeting the end-
goals of HSPD-12.

NIST has considerable experience in the development of accreditation methodology, most
significantly with the widely accepted approach to accreditation in SP 800-37, Guide for the
Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, and its family of
related documents. While SP 800-37 is focused on the accreditation of the security of
information systems, rather than the accreditation of the reliability of PCIs, it does offer a
practical foundation for accreditation programs in general. This document utilizes various
aspects of SP 800-37 and applies them to accrediting the reliability of PCIs. Accreditation of a
PCI requires prior accreditation of the security of all information systems used by the PCI in
accordance with SP 800-37.

One difference between the accreditation of the security of information systems and the
accreditation of the reliability of a PCI is that an organization has considerable flexibility in how
they prepare for a SP 800-37 accreditation (particularly in implementing security controls), but
have little room for variation under SP 800-79-1. Much of the flexibility in SP 800-37 comes
from the necessity of acceptable variations in security controls, since individual information
systems within varied environments may have significantly different security requirements.
Conversely, the desire for standardization that is implicit in HSPD-12 has led to the development
of a stable set of requirements. There may be some flexibility in how a requirement is met, but a
majority of requirements must be satisfied in a uniform manner in order to deem a PCI as
reliable. Allowing too much latitude in how a requirement is met undermines this reliability.

Although organizations may feel constrained by the uniformity required by FIPS 201-1,
standardization greatly contributes to achieving the objectives of HSPD-12 across PIV Card
Issuer implementations. For all organizations to accept the PIV Cards of other organizations, one
set of rules (i.e., FIPS 201-1) must be followed by all PIV system participants. This Special
Publication provides a way of determining if the participants are following these rules.
Accreditation efforts that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable provide a basis for determining
the reliability and capability of providers who issue PIV Cards, which herein is defined as
consistent adherence to the PIV standards. In particular, if PCIs meet the requirements of FIPS
201-1 and relevant documents as verified through applicable assessment procedures and
maintain consistency of their operations with respect to meeting these criteria, they can be
considered reliable as is required by HSPD-12.

The objectives of the guidelines in this document are to—

   •   Outline the requirements to be met by a PCI, the rationale for the requirements and the
       assessment procedures required to determine the satisfaction of those requirements by a
       PCI through a combination of policies, procedures, and operations.




                                                  4
   •   Describe an accreditation methodology that provides a framework for organizing the
       requirements and assessment procedures stated above and at the same time provides
       coverage for all the control objectives stated in HSPD-12.
   •   Demonstrate the fact that the application of the methodology will result in assessment
       outcomes that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable.
   •   Emphasize the role of risk in arriving at an accreditation decision, based on assessment
       outcomes that takes into account the organization’s mission.

1.1 Applicability, Intended Audience, and Usage

This document is applicable to, and shall be used by, all Federal organizations for all their
employees and contractors for authorizing their physical access to Federal facilities (e.g.,
buildings, leased offices) and logical access to Federal information systems. It may also be used
by any other organization (e.g., state and local government, educational, non-profit) desiring
compliance with FIPS 201-1.

All Federal organizations are required to adopt HSPD-12, implement FIPS 201-1, and use SP
800-79-1 to assess the adequacy of their implementations and accredit the reliability of the
directly-controlled or sub-contracted services involved in creating and issuing PIV Cards. All
non-Federal organizations (e.g., state governments) and private organizations specifying
mandatory conformance with FIPS 201-1 in a procurement contract should use these guidelines
to assess and accredit the services of their PIV Card Issuers.

SP 800-79-1 is consistent and compatible with HSPD-12, FIPS 201-1, and SP 800-37. SP 800-
79-1 includes a number of roles, requirements, definitions, specifications, and procedures needed
to adequately assess and accredit the reliability of a PIV Card Issuing organization (PCI). All
PCIs should issue PIV Cards only after they have been authorized to operate based on this
document. In situations where a PCI that has already started issuing cards fails a SP 800-79-1
accreditation, it must immediately halt operations. Similarly, if the PCI that has already started
issuing cards obtains a SP 800-79-1 accreditation subject to some terms and conditions, those
restrictions must be immediately enforced in its operations.

Once a PCI is accredited using the guidelines within this document, trust can be established in
the PIV Cards it issues. However, organizations that accept PIV Cards issued by PCIs that are
not accredited are doing so at their own risk, since no assurance has been obtained about the
reliability of operations for those PCIs.

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
specification are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

1.2 History of this Revision

In order to satisfy HSPD-12, SP 800-79 was developed in July 2005, shortly after publication of
FIPS 201, in order to provide organizations with an initial set of guidelines for accreditation of
their PIV Card Issuers. While the original version had a clear idea of the functions needed for


                                                 5
deployment of a PIV Card, it was impossible to foresee how the organization and management of
these functions and the structuring of the PCI would evolve. The experience gained since then
has provided the knowledge and perspective needed to develop a new accreditation methodology
that is objective, efficient, and will result in consistent and repeatable accreditation decisions.

The major changes for this revision include:

   •   Removal of attributes as the basis of reliability assessment, and replacing them with PCI
       controls, traceable to specific requirements from FIPS 201-1 and related documents;
   •   Additional guidelines on how to determine the accreditation boundaries of a PCI;
   •   Discussion of the risk involved in authorizing the operation of a PCI;
   •   Removal of “Section 4.0 - PCI Functions and Operations” and “Section 5.0 - PIV
       Services and Operations,” which were narrative discussions of FIPS 201-1 requirements;
   •   Clarification of the similarities and differences between the accreditation of computer
       systems for secure operation as specified in SP 800-37 and the accreditation of the
       reliability of an organization as specified in SP 800-79-1;
   •   Changing the term “certification” to “assessment”; and
   •   Use of “organization” instead of “department” or “agency.”

1.3 Timelines for using the revised Guidelines

These revised guidelines for accrediting PCIs will take effect immediately following publication
of SP 800-79-1. Hence, organizations shall use these revised guidelines for accrediting any new
PCI, any PCI whose accreditation is currently in progress, or any PCI that previously has gone
through accreditation (under SP 800-79) and failed (with or without being issued a Denial of
Authorization to Operate (DATO) or Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)). Any PCI that
has already been accredited and currently holds the Authorization to Operate (ATO) under SP
800-79 must be re-accredited based on these revised guidelines no later than one year after the

2. THE FUNDAMENTALS

This chapter presents the fundamentals of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card Issuer (PCI)
accreditation including: (i) definitions of a PCI and a PCI Facility; (ii) outsourcing PCI services
or functions; (iii) the differences between assessment and accreditation; (iv) accreditation
boundaries of a PCI; (v) roles and responsibilities; (vi) the relationship between accreditation
under Special Publication (SP) 800-37 and SP 800-79-1; (vii) preparing for the assessment; (viii)
types of accreditation decisions; (ix) use of risk in the accreditation decision; and (x) the contents
of the accreditation package.

2.1 PCI

At the highest level, a PCI includes all functions required to produce, issue, and maintain PIV
Cards for an organization. A PCI is considered operational if all relevant roles and
responsibilities have been defined and appointed; suitable policies and compliant procedures
have been implemented for processes, including sponsorship, enrollment/identity proofing,
adjudication, card production, card activation/issuance, and maintenance; and information
system components that are utilized for performing the above-mentioned functions (processes)
have been assessed and shown to meet all technical and operational requirements prescribed in
FIPS 201-1 and related documents.

In order to comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), an
organization must first establish a PCI that conforms to and satisfies the requirements of FIPS
201-1 and related documents. The PCI must then be accredited (i.e., using the guidelines
specified in SP 800-79-1). An organization has certain flexibility in establishing a PCI. It may
outsource some of the required processes within its PCI. Large organizations with widely
varying missions for its operating units may even establish multiple PCIs. Regardless of how a
PCI is structured, the organization (e.g., Federal agency, Federal contractor) is responsible for
the management and oversight of the PCI and maintains full responsibility for the accreditation
of the PCI as required in HSPD-12.

A PCI must be completely described in its PCI operations plan. This comprehensive document
incorporates all the information about the PCI that is needed for any independent party to review
it and assess the capability and reliability of the PCI’s operations. A PCI operations plan includes
a description of the structure of the PCI, its facilities, any external service providers, the roles
and responsibilities within the PCI, policies and procedures which govern its operations, and a
description of how requirements of FIPS 201-1 are being met. A template for a PCI operations
plan is provided in Appendix D.

2.2 PCI Facilities

A PCI Facility (PCIF) is a physical site or location–including all equipment, staff, and
documentation–that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the following PIV functions:
(i) enrollment/identity proofing; (ii) card production; (iii) card activation/issuance; or (iv)
maintenance. A PCIF operates under the auspices of a PCI, and implements the policies and
executes procedures prescribed by the PCI for those functions sanctioned for the facility (e.g. an
enrollment/identity proofing facility).



                                                  8
Based on certain characteristics (e.g. size, geographic locations, the organization(s) that it
supports), a PCI may have its services and functions provided centrally or distributed across
multiple locations. Independent of how or where a PCI implements these functions, at least one
PCIF is required. For example, a geographically dispersed organization may decide to have
enrollment/identity proofing and card activation/issuance functions performed in different
facilities in different parts of the country so that applicants can minimize travel. In this example,
the different PCIFs fall under the purview (policy, management) of a single PCI which
encompasses all the functions necessary to issue PIV Cards. Within that PCI, the geographically
dispersed PCIFs have specific responsibilities and are under the direct management control of
the PCI.


2.3 Outsourcing of PCI Functions

An organization may out-source its PCI functions to one or more organizations. As the
complexity and cost of new technology increase, the organization may decide that the most
efficient and cost-effective solution for implementing HSPD-12 is to seek the services of an
external service provider. An external service provider may be a Government agency, a private
entity, or some other organization that offers services or functions necessary to issue PIV Cards.

Figure 1 provides an illustration of the functions that can be outsourced. Only the organization
which “owns” (i.e., manages, controls, or privately owns) the PCI can decide which of its
employees and contractors are required to apply for a PIV Card (Sponsorship – a responsible
official of the organization providing the biographic and organizational affiliation of the PIV
card applicant) and under what conditions the application will be approved (Adjudication – the
kind of background information that will form the basis for authorization for PIV Card Issuance).
Therefore, these two functions cannot be outsourced.




                            Figure 1 - Outsourcing of PCI Functions
A PCI which out-sources services to an external provider must make sure that all privacy-related
requirements are satisfied. The PCI is responsible for ensuring that privacy requirements are
being met both internally and by every external service provider.

If an organization’s management is considering using the services of a PCI set up by another
organization, the operations plan and associated documents, the accreditation decision and
evidence of implementation of FIPS 201-1 requirements of that PCI (service provider PCI) must
be reviewed. Similarly, if a PCI is using the services of an external service provider selectively
for one or more of its PCI processes, the provider’s capability to meet FIPS 201-1 requirements


                                                  9
for those processes must be reviewed as well. In both cases, the information gathered as part of
this review activity must be included as part of the PCI’s assessment leading to accreditation.
Outsourced functions must be assessed prior to accreditation of the PCI.


2.4 Assessment and Accreditation

HSPD-12 mandates that PIV Cards be “issued only by providers whose reliability has been
established by an official accreditation process.” This document contains guidelines for
satisfying the requirements for an official accreditation and provides a methodology that any
organization can utilize to formally accredit a PCI. This methodology consists of two major
elements–assessment and accreditation. While assessment and accreditation are very closely
related, they are two very distinct activities.

Assessment, which occurs before accreditation, is the process of gathering evidence regarding a
PCI’s satisfaction of the requirements of FIPS 201-1, both at the organization and facility level.
Assessment activities include interviews with PCI and PCIF personnel, a review of
documentation, observation of processes, and execution of tests to determine reliability of the
PCI. The result of the assessment is a report that serves as the basis for an appropriate
accreditation decision. The report is also the basis for developing corrective actions for removing
or mitigating discovered deficiencies.

Distinct from assessment, accreditation is the decision to authorize the operation of a PCI once it
has been established that the requirements of FIPS 201-1 have been met and the risks regarding
security and privacy are acceptable. The individual making the accreditation decision must be
knowledgeable of HSPD-12 and aware of the potential risks to the organization’s operations,
assets, and personnel (e.g., applicants, PCI Facility staff).

The assessment and the accreditation are both carried out by the organization that owns the PCI.

In order to make an informed, risk-based accreditation decision, the assessment process should
seek to answer the following questions:

   •   Has the PCI implemented the requirements of FIPS 201-1 in the manner consistent with
       the standard?
   •   Do personnel understand the responsibilities of their roles and/or positions, and reliably
       perform all required activities as described in the PCI’s documentation?
   •   Are services and functions throughout the PCI and its facilities (e.g., enrollment/identity
       proofing, card activation/issuance) carried out in a consistent, reliable, and repeatable
       manner?
   •   Have deficiencies identified during the assessment been documented, current and
       potential impact on security and privacy been highlighted, and the recommendations and
       timelines for correction or mediation been included in the assessment report?




                                                10
2.5 Accreditation Boundary for the PCI

An organization preparing to accredit a PCI must first identify the appropriate accreditation
boundary. The accreditation boundary defines the specific PCI operations that are to be the target
of the assessment and accreditation. A PCI comprises the complete set of functions required for
the issuance and maintenance of PIV Cards. In determining the accreditation boundary, the
organization may consider if the functions are being performed identically in all PCI facilities,
are using identical information technology components, and are under the same direct
management control. For instance, an organization may have two sub-organizations, each of
which has distinct processes and management structures. The organization may decide to
establish two separate PCIs, each with its own accreditation boundary. In this example, two
separate PCI assessments would be undertaken. Each assessment would result in an independent
accreditation decision.

In drawing an accreditation boundary, an organization may want to include only a subset of PCI
facilities. For example, if a PCI has several facilities, some of which are ready for operation and
some that are still in the development stage, the organization may choose to define the
accreditation boundary to include the PCI and only those facilities that are ready to be assessed.
If the accreditation is successful, the PCI and a subset of its facilities will be authorized to
operate and begin issuing cards. The remaining PCIFs can continue with implementation and be
included in the accreditation boundary at a later date.

In the case of outsourcing PCI services that are not under direct management control of the
organization nor physically located within its facilities, the organization must include the
functions provided by external service providers within the accreditation boundary to make
certain that they are included within the scope of accreditation. This assures that no matter how
and where the functions are performed, the organization maintains complete accountability for
the reliability of its PIV program.

Care should be used in defining the accreditation boundary for a PCI. A boundary that is
unnecessarily expansive (i.e., including too many dissimilar processes and business functions or
geographically dispersed facilities) makes the assessment and accreditation process extremely
unwieldy and complex. On the other hand, a boundary that is unnecessarily limited increases the
number of needed assessments and accreditations and thus drives up the total cost for an
organization. Establishing a boundary for a PCI and its subsequent accreditation are
organization-level activities that should include participation of all key personnel. An
organization should strive to define the accreditation boundary for a PCI that strikes a balance
between the costs and benefits of assessment and accreditation.

While the above considerations should be useful to an organization in determining the boundary
for its PCI for purposes of accreditation, they should not limit the organization’s flexibility in
establishing a practical boundary that promotes an effective HSPD-12 compliant
implementation. The scope of an accreditation is a PCI (whose boundaries are formed by
included facilities) and not individual facilities (PCIFs).




                                                 11
2.6 PCI Roles and Responsibilities

FIPS 201-1 Appendix A provides examples of two models that satisfy the requisite PIV control
objectives and meet the requirements for issuance of PIV Cards. An organization may select
either of the two models, employ a hybrid, or utilize a completely new model. PIV Card issuance
roles and their processes are to be selected based on the organization’s structure, its mission, and
operating environment. The organization must make sure that a separation of roles has been
established and the processes are in compliance with FIPS 201-1.

Roles discussed in FIPS 201-1 pertain to PCI processes and functions, and are included by
reference, but not defined in this document. This document identifies only roles and
responsibilities of key personnel involved in the accreditation of a PCI 1 . Recognizing that
organizations have widely varying missions and structures, there may be some differences in
naming conventions for accreditation-related roles and in how the associated responsibilities are
allocated among personnel (e.g. one individual may perform multiple roles).

2.6.1 Senior Authorizing Official
The Senior Authorizing Official (SAO) (see Figure 2) of an organization is responsible for all
PCI operations. The SAO has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has
authority over all functions and services provided by the PCI.

2.6.2 Designated Accreditation Authority
The Designated Accreditation Authority (DAA) is an official of the organization with the
authority to review all assessments of a PCI and its facilities, and to accredit the PCI as required
by HSPD-12. Through accreditation, the DAA accepts responsibility for the operation of the PCI
at an acceptable level of risk to the organization. The SAO can also fulfill the role of the DAA.

2.6.3 Organization Identity Management Official
The Organization Identity Management Official (OIMO) is responsible for implementing
policies of the organization, assuring that all specified procedures of the PCI are being performed
reliably, and providing guidance and assistance to the PCI Facilities. The OIMO implements and
manages the PCI operations plan; ensures that all PCI roles are filled with capable, trustworthy,
knowledgeable, and trained staff; makes certain that all PCI services, equipment, and processes
meet FIPS 201-1 requirements; monitors and coordinates activities with PCI Facility
Manager(s); and supports the accreditation process. The OIMO cannot fulfill the role of the
DAA.

2.6.4 PCI Facility Manager
A PCI Facility (PCIF) Manager manages the day-to-day operations of a PCI facility. A PCIF
Manager is responsible for implementing all operating procedures for those functions that have
been designated for that facility. The PCIF Manager must ensure that all PIV processes adhere to
the requirements of FIPS 201-1, and that all PIV services performed at the PCIF are carried out

1
    Organizations may define other significant roles (e.g., PIV System liaisons, operations managers) to support the PCI
    accreditation process.



                                                                 12
in a consistent and reliable manner in accordance with the organization’s policies and procedures
and the OIMO’s direction. In some cases (e.g. small organizations), the OIMO can fulfill the role
of the PCIF Manager.

2.6.5 Assessor
The Assessor is responsible for performing a comprehensive and independent assessment of a
PCI. The Assessor (usually supported by an assessment team) verifies that PIV processes in a
PCI comply with control objectives of FIPS 201-1. The results of an assessment are presented to
the OIMO who reviews the assessment findings and prepares recommended corrective actions to
reduce or eliminate any discrepancies or shortcomings. The Assessor is also responsible for
providing recommendations for reducing or eliminating deficiencies and security weaknesses,
describing the potential impact of those deficiencies if not corrected. An Assessor cannot be
assigned the DAA’s role and vice versa.

To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment, the Assessor must be
independent of the office(s) and personnel directly responsible for the day-to-day operation of
the PCI. The Assessor shall also be independent of those individuals responsible for correcting
deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the assessment phase. The independence of the
Assessor is an important factor in maintaining the credibility of the assessment results and
ensuring that the DAA receives objective information in order to make an informed accreditation
decision.

2.6.6 PIV Card Applicant Representative
The PIV Card Applicant Representative (CAR) is an optional role within the PCI and may be
established and used at the discretion of the organization. The CAR represents the interests of
current or prospective employees and contractors who are the applicants for PIV Cards. They are
responsible for assisting an applicant who is denied a PIV Card because of missing or incorrect
information, and for ensuring that all applicants obtain useful information and assistance when
needed. This role may be assigned to someone in the organization’s personnel or human
resources department as part of their normal duties.

2.6.6 Privacy Official
The responsibilities of the Privacy Official (PO) are defined in FIPS 201-1. The person filling
this role shall not assume any other operational role in the PCI. The PO issues policy guidelines
with respect to collection and handling of personally identifiable information from applicants so
as to ensure that the PCI is in compliance with all relevant directives of the privacy laws. The
PO’s role may be filled by an organization’s existing official for privacy (e.g., a Chief Privacy
Officer).

2.6.7 Role Assignment Policies
Although PCI roles are independent and should be filled by different people if feasible, there
may be a need (e.g., because of availability or economy) to have one person fill more than one
role. Except for the roles of Assessor and Privacy Official, one person may perform more than
one role if needed. If an organization has multiple PCIs, one person may be assigned the same
role in several or all of them. For instance, a SAO may be responsible for several PCIs within the


                                                13
organization. Similarly, within a single PCI, a PCIF Manager may be responsible for a number of
PCI Facilities. Of the roles described, the SAO, DAA, OIMO, CAR, Assessor and PO must be
employees of the organization that owns the PCI (e.g., Federal employees in the case of Federal
agencies).

2.6.8 Accreditation-related PCI Roles
Figure 2 illustrates a possible role structure when a PCI has multiple PCIFs. The SAO has the
primary authority and responsibility for the PCI. Reporting to the SAO are the OIMO and the
DAA. A PCI Facility Manager is responsible for managing operations at each PCI facility and
reports to the OIMO. The dotted lines leading to the PO and the Assessor indicate their
independence from the day to day operations of the PCI.




                               Figure 2 - PCI Accreditation Roles

2.7 The Relationship between SP 800-79-1 and SP 800-37

While accreditation is the major topic of both special publications, the goals of accreditation are
distinct in SP 800-37 and SP 800-79-1. Accreditation under SP 800-37, as mandated by
Appendix III of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, focuses on
“authorizing processing” of information systems based on an assessment of security at the
information system level. Accreditation as discussed herein and as mandated by HSPD-12 is
concerned with the assessment of the “reliability” of a PCI to perform its functions in accordance
with FIPS 201-1. An accreditation decision granted under SP 800-37 signifies that an
organization official accepts responsibility for the security (in terms of confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of information) of the information system. Accreditation of a PCI’s reliability


                                                  14
under SP 800-79-1 indicates that the organization official agrees to accept the risk that the PCI
can operate within the control objectives outlined in HSPD-12 for “secure and reliable forms of
identification.” However in both cases, the organization official (Authorizing Official (AO) in
the case of SP 800-37, and DAA in the case of SP 800-79-1) accepts responsibility, and is fully
accountable for any adverse impacts to the organization if a breach in security, privacy, or policy
occurs.

SP 800-79-1 focuses on the accreditation of an organization’s capability and reliability, but
depends on adequate security for all the supporting information systems that have been
accredited under SP 800-37. Therefore, before the organization official accredits the PCI and its
facilities, all PCI information systems used must be accredited.

In many cases, accreditation under SP 800-37 will be granted by an organization official
different than the official responsible for accrediting the PCI. The former is an organization
official tasked with making a decision on whether to authorize operation of an information
system based on its security posture. The latter must be someone designated specifically for
authorizing the operation of the PCI after it has been assessed and determined to be compliant
with FIPS 201-1 control objectives.

2.8 Preparing for a PCI’s Assessment

To facilitate an assessment of a PCI in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner, it is essential
that all members of the Assessment team and staff of the PCI understand their specific roles and
responsibilities, and participate as needed. The PCI, its facility personnel, and the team
responsible for performing the assessment must cooperate and collaborate in a joint manner to
ensure the success of the assessment. Specific responsibilities of the assessment team are listed
below. For further information, including considerations that an organization may want to take
into account when outsourcing assessments, refer to NIST Interagency Report (IR) 7328,
Security Assessment Provider Requirements and Customer Responsibilities: Building a Security
Assessment Credentialing Program for Federal Information Systems.

2.8.1 PCI Duties
Before the assessment can begin, an Assessor must be designated. The Assessor conducts the
assessment and oversees the assessment team if one is needed. The assessment team may be
made up of employees from the organization or personnel provided by a public or private sector
entity contracted to provide services. Members of the assessment team should have various
capabilities that are required to perform the activities specified in this document. Assessment
team members should work together to prepare for, conduct, and document the findings of the
PCI’s assessment and assessments of all PCI facilities within the PCI boundary. Each team must
be made up of individuals that collectively have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to conduct,
evaluate, and document all assessments, including those performed on the information systems
within the PCI.

Once an assessment team is in place, the OIMO and other relevant PCI personnel should begin
the preparation for the assessment. Thorough preparations by both the PCI and the assessment
team are important aspects of conducting an effective assessment. The PCI sets the stage for the
assessment by identifying all appropriate personnel and making them available during the


                                                15
assessment. A fundamental requirement for accreditation is interviews by the assessment team of
all PCI personnel. Personnel and officials must be notified of the pending assessment, must
understand their roles in the process, and must be made available in accordance with the planned
assessment schedule.

The OIMO must ensure that all relevant documentation has been completed and organized
before the assessment begins. This documentation includes policies and procedures,
organizational structure, information system architecture, product and vendor details, and
specifics regarding the implementation of all the requirements from FIPS 201-1 and related
publications. If the PCI has outsourced functions to an external service provider, all necessary
documentation must be obtained from the provider regarding those operations utilized by the
PCI. Before providing any documentation to the assessment team, the OIMO must review it to
make certain it is both current and approved.

Another significant activity during the assessment is the observation by the assessment team of
actual processes performed by the PCI. In order for the assessment team to confirm that
processes are implemented in accordance with the operations plan, the PCI will need to ensure
that assessment team members have access to, and are able to observe, PCI processes in real
time. This could include scheduling enrollment/identity proofing, adjudication, card production,
card activation/issuance, and maintenance activities for observation by the assessment team.

In order to aid the PCI’s planning and preparation for the assessment, Appendix C includes a
readiness review checklist. The checklist contains items needed during the assessment process.
Satisfying this list of items before the assessment commences will facilitate efficient utilization
of the assessment team’s time, and will contribute towards the overall effectiveness of the
assessment activity.

2.8.2 Assessment Team Duties
The independence of the assessment team is an important factor in assessing the credibility of the
assessment results. In order to ensure that the results of the assessment are impartial and
unbiased, the members of the assessment team must not be involved in the development, day-to-
day maintenance, and operations of the PCI, or in the removal, correction, or remediation of
deficiencies.

The assessment team may obtain information during an assessment that the organization does not
want to disclose publicly. The assessment team has an obligation to safely and securely store and
protect the confidentiality of all security assessment related records and information, including
limiting access to the individuals that need to know the information. When using, storing, and
transmitting information related to the PCI assessment, the assessment team shall follow the
guidelines established by the organization in addition to all relevant laws, regulations, and
standards regarding the need, protection, and privacy of information.

2.9 Accreditation Decisions

An accreditation decision is a judgment made by the DAA regarding authorizing operation of a
PCI and its facilities. The DAA reviews the results of the assessment, considers the impact to the
organization of any identified deficiencies, and then decides whether to authorize the operation


                                                 16
of the PCI and its facilities. In doing so, the DAA is agreeing to accept the security and privacy
risks to the organization in issuing and maintaining PIV Cards.

During the accreditation decision process, the DAA must evaluate the assessment findings for
the PCI and each facility within the accreditation boundary. If the PCI has outsourced some of its
services or functions, the DAA must review all relevant assessments and accreditations that have
been granted to the external service provider and include them as a part of the overall evaluation
of risk to the organization.

An authorization decision by a DAA must always be granted for a specific PCI before
commencement of operations, and for each PCI there can be only one authorization decision. In
issuing this decision, the DAA must indicate the PCI accreditation boundary to which the
authorization applies. A DAA grants an authorization to a PCI, and then specifies which facilities
(along with any exceptions or restrictions) are permitted to operate under that authorization.
This allows the PCI and any authorized facilities to begin operations while any remaining
facilities focus on addressing deficiencies with FIPS 201-1 and its supporting documents. At a
later date, these latter facilities can be reassessed. After reviewing the new findings, the DAA
can reissue the authorization for the PCI and expand the accreditation boundary to which the
authorization applies by including the newly assessed facilities.

The major input to the accreditation decision is the assessment report. To ensure the assessment
report is properly interpreted and the justification for the accreditation decision properly
communicated, the DAA should meet with the Assessor, the OIMO, and the PCI Facility
Manager(s) prior to issuing an accreditation decision to discuss the assessment findings and the
terms and conditions of the authorization.

There are three accreditation alternatives that can be rendered by the DAA:

   •   Authorization to operate;
   •   Interim authorization to operate; or
   •   Denial of authorization to operate.

2.9.1 Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAA deems that the PCI and its
facilities conform to FIPS 201-1 to an acceptable degree, and will continue to do so reliably
during the accreditation validity period, an authorization to operate (ATO) may be issued. The
PCI and its facilities are authorized to perform services in compliance with all relevant policies,
in conformance to all relevant standards, and in accordance with the documented operations
plan. The DAA shall indicate exactly which facilities are included in the ATO accreditation
decision. An ATO can only be granted to a PCI if there are no limitations or restrictions imposed
on any of its facilities that are included in the accreditation boundary.

After receiving an ATO under SP 800-79-1, re-accreditation shall be performed within three (3)
years, or when there is a significant change in personnel or operating procedures (includes both
improvement and degradation of operations) of a PCI, or when additional PCIFs are being added
to a PCI. There may also be cases where one or more PCIFs cease operation. If this situation
results in a PCI service identified in the PCI’s Operations Plan becoming unavailable, then the


                                                 17
DAA must issue a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO- See Section 2.9.3). On the other
hand On the other hand, if the PCI can continue to provide all services in the PCI’s Operations
Plan, then the accreditation decision letter has to be modified to exclude those facilities that have
ceased operations (thus revising the accreditation boundary). The required PCI re-accreditation
activities are at the discretion of the DAA and based on the extent and type of change.

2.9.2 Interim Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAA deems the discrepancies to be
significant, but there is an overarching necessity to allow the PCI and its facilities to operate, an
interim authorization to operate (IATO) may be issued. An interim authorization to operate is
rendered when the identified deficiencies in the PCI and its facilities are significant, but can be
addressed in a timely manner. These deficiencies must be documented so that they can be
addressed during the planning of corrective actions. An interim authorization is an authorization
to operate under specific terms and conditions. The DAA shall indicate exactly which facilities
are included in the IATO accreditation decision during this interim period, along with any
limitations or restrictions imposed. The maximum duration of an IATO is three (3) months. A
maximum of two (2) consecutive IATOs may be granted for a PCI. Failure to correct
deficiencies found in the PCI after the expiration of the second IATO must result in an issuance
of a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) for the PCI. The accreditation boundary may be
revised to exclude PCI Facilities that exhibit significant deficiencies in performing their
functions.

A PCI is not considered accredited during the period of an IATO. When the deficiencies have
been corrected, the IATO should be replaced with an ATO. Significant changes in the status of
the PCI (e.g. addition of new facilities) that occur during the IATO period shall be reported
immediately to the DAA.

2.9.3 Denial of Authorization to Operate
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAA deems operation of the PCI to be
unacceptable, a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) shall be transmitted to the OIMO.
Failure to receive authorization to operate indicates that there are major deficiencies in reliably
meeting the requirements of FIPS 201-1 and its related documents. The PCI is not accredited
and must not be allowed to operate. If the PCI is currently in operation, all functions must be
halted including all operations in its facilities. If the PCI was previously accredited and had
issued PIV Cards under an ATO, the OIMO along with the PCIF Manager(s) should consider
whether a revocation of PIV Cards is necessary. The DAA and the Assessor should work with
the OIMO and PCIF Manager(s) to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct the
deficiencies.

A PCI must not be authorized to operate if one or more of its critical information systems has not
been accredited or is issued a DATO under SP 800-37. In the case where an IATO (under SP
800-37) has been issued for an information system within the PCI, the DAA may issue no greater
than an IATO to the PCI. Once the SP 800-37 IATO is replaced with an SP 800-37 ATO, the
DAA can issue a SP 800-79-1 ATO. If the SP 800-37 ATO expires for one or more of
information systems during the course of operation of a PCI, the OIMO shall assess the



                                                  18
criticality of the system for PCI operations and present the analysis to the DAA. The DAA then
can exercise the following options:

   •   Specify a short time during which the information systems of the PCI must be re-
       accredited under SP 800-37 without changing the PCI’s ATO status;
   •   Downgrade the current SP 800-79-1 ATO to an IATO; or
   •   If circumstances warrant, issue a SP 800-79-1 DATO and halt all PCI operations.

2.10 The Use of Risk in the Accreditation Decision

Accreditation is the official management decision by the DAA to authorize operation of a PCI,
based on an assessment of its reliability and an acceptance of the risk inherent in that decision.
By granting an authorization to operate, the DAA accepts responsibility for the reliability of the
PCI and is fully accountable for any adverse impact to the organization or any other organization
from cards issued by the PCI, its facilities, and any external service providers.

The assessment of a PCI provides the DAA with the basis for not only determining its reliability,
but also for determining whether to accept the risk to the organization in granting an ATO. As
the requirements in FIPS 201-1 and related documents form the basis of the assessment and are
ultimately derived from the policy objectives of HSPD-12, those not reliably met by the PCI and
its facilities represent the potential for adverse impact.

Implementation of an HSPD-12 program exposes an organization to specific risks at the mission
level of the organization. The PIV Card is used to establish assurance of the identity of the
cardholder, and as such, it must be trusted as a basis for granting access to the logical and
physical resources of the organization. Any problem with an issued PIV Card that undermines
that assurance could expose an organization to harm. Furthermore, the collection, processing,
and dissemination of significant amounts of personal information required to issue a PIV Card
increases the threat of this information being used for malicious purposes. It is the DAA’s
responsibility to weigh the risks of these and other security and privacy impacts of issuing PIV
Cards when making the accreditation decision.

Furthermore, as HSPD-12 is a government-wide mandate based on a standard of interoperability
allowing organizations to accept other organizations’ PIV Cards, accreditation decisions within a
single organization directly impact other organizations. For example, an interoperable identity
credential issued by an accredited organization becomes the source of trust for another
organization to authorize access to physical and logical resources, based on verification of that
identity. The DAA’s signature on the accreditation letter thus signifies his/her acceptance of
responsibility (i.e., accountability) for the operations of the PCI, not only to the issuing
organization, but also to other organizations that are in the federated circle of trust.

2.11 Accreditation Submission Package and Supporting Documentation

The accreditation submission package documents the results of the assessment phase and
provides the DAA with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of the PCI. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the



                                                19
DAA, the OIMO is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and submission of the
accreditation package. The accreditation package contains the following documents:

       •    The PCI operations plan (including all PCI Facilities Standard Operating Procedures
            [SOPs] and attachments)
       •    SP 800-37 accreditation letters
       •    The assessment report
       •    The corrective actions plan (if required)

The PCI operations plan contains the PCI’s policies, procedures, and processes for all the major
PCI functional areas. The operations plan provides a complete picture of the structure,
management, and operations of the PCI to the Assessor and DAA. Appendix D provides a
template of what to include in the PCI operations plan. One of the most significant pieces of
information contained within the operations plan is the list of PCI controls, how they were
implemented, and who is responsible for their management. This description of the PCI controls
makes it a simple process for the Assessor to quickly ascertain how they were implemented and
by whom.

If certain functions described in the operations plan are outsourced, the PCI’s operation plan can
reference or “point to” the external service provider’s operation plan and related documentation,
such as support agreements and any contracts. In this manner, the Assessor has access to the
information regarding the external service provider’s operations without requiring the PCI to
duplicate any documentation.

The SP 800-37 accreditation letters are the formal authorization to operate the PCI information
systems that are directly involved in the issuance and maintenance of PIV Cards.

The PCI assessment report, prepared by the Assessor, provides the information needed to
determine the extent to which the requirements are being met and are expected to continue as
such during future operations. For each deficiency that is found, the assessment report must
include the potential impact of the deficiency if it continues without correction and the
recommended corrective action to correct it. Appendix E provides a template of what to include
in the assessment report.

The corrective actions plan (CAP), prepared by the OIMO with the assistance of the Assessor,
describes the changes needed to correct deficiencies noted during the assessment with a time
frame for completing each change.

The OIMO submits the accreditation submission package to the DAA. 2 Figure 3 illustrates the
primary components of the accreditation submission package.

    Accreditation packages may be submitted in either paper or electronic format. Appropriate measures should be employed to
    protect the information contained in accreditation packages (electronic or paper format) in accordance with organization policy.

                         Figure 3 - Accreditation Submission Package

Upon receiving and reviewing the accreditation package and in consultation with the Assessor,
the DAA decides whether to authorize operations of the PCI. The accreditation decision letter
transmits the accreditation decision from the DAA to the OIMO. The accreditation decision
letter contains the following information:

   •   Accreditation decision;
   •   Supporting rationale for the decision; and
   •   Terms and conditions for the authorization, including which PCIFs are included.

The accreditation decision letter (see Appendix F for examples) informs the OIMO that the PCI
is— (i) authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis; or (iii) not authorized
to operate. The supporting rationale includes the justification for the DAA’s decision. The
terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions
placed on the operation of the PCI, including which PCIFs are included in the decision. The
accreditation decision letter is attached to the original accreditation submission package and
becomes the accreditation decision package.

The DAA sends the accreditation decision package to the OIMO and retains a copy of it. The
OIMO carefully reviews the terms and conditions of authorization before initiating the necessary
steps for PCI operations. Both parties mark the accreditation decision package appropriately for
storage under the organization’s retention policy.

3. PIV CARD ISSUER (PCI) COMPLIANCE

3.1 Introducing PCI Controls

Accreditation of a PCI is a broader endeavor than accreditation of the security of an information
system under SP 800-37. The requirements specified in Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 201-1 cover all major aspects of a PCI, including organizational preparedness; security
management and data protection; infrastructure; and PCI processes. Each broad area is defined
herein as a PCI Accreditation Topic (PAT). In addition to providing structure to the assessment,
PATs are also used to summarize the assessment results for reporting. In addition, they are used
to structure the report to senior organization management that provides an analysis of the
strengths and weaknesses within the PCI.

The PCI Accreditation Topics:

   •   Organizational Preparedness relates to the capability, knowledge, and understanding of
       senior management regarding the formation and operation of the PCI. Roles and
       responsibilities must be clearly identified, and policies and procedures must be defined,
       documented, implemented, and enforced.

   •   Security Management & Data Protection involves implementing and operating
       appropriate security management procedures, operational controls, and technical
       protection measures to ensure that privacy requirements are satisfied, the rights of
       individuals are assured, and personal data is protected.

   •   Infrastructure Elements represents the activities required to procure, deploy, and
       maintain the PCI information system components. PCI information system components
       (e.g., PKI, biometrics, and card production) must meet the technical specifications
       defined in FIPS 201-1 and related documents. Additionally, information systems used
       within the PCI need to be certified and accredited under Special Publication (SP) 800-37
       for FISMA compliance.

   •   Processes are classes of functions that collectively span the entire PIV lifecycle
       activities, such as sponsorship, enrollment/identity proofing, adjudication, card
       production, card activation/issuance, and maintenance.

Each PAT is sub-divided into one or more Accreditation Focus Areas. Each focus area is a set of
closely-related requirements that need to be met by the PCI and its facilities. Each requirement
and the procedure, process, or technical product (termed a “PCI control”) used to satisfy each
requirement listed under a focus area needs to be satisfied by a PCI. However, the manner in
which the requirement is satisfied and how its specifications are implemented and managed may
vary from organization to organization.

For instance, each PCI is required to identity-proof their applicants (i.e., use due diligence in
validating the claimed identity of the applicant, using all documents provided by the applicant)
prior to enrollment. This process can be implemented in one of several ways, depending upon the



                                                22
structure, size, and geographical distribution of an organization’s facilities. The process could be
conducted at a central location or could be distributed throughout the country within regional
centers. It could be operated directly by the organization or by an outside service provider.
However, irrespective of the implementation approach, this enrollment/identity-proofing activity
needs to be reliably and accurately performed.

PCI controls are designed to satisfy specific requirements in FIPS 201-1 and its related
documents. If the underlying specification requirements are mandatory, then the corresponding
PCI controls are mandatory as well. There are also PCI controls associated with optional
requirements in FIPS 201-1. This category of PCI controls also becomes mandatory if the PCI is
implementing those optional requirements. An example is an optional requirement to store the
electronic facial image of the card holder in the PIV Card. If the PCI’s card activation/issuance’s
process implements this option, then the associated PCI control should be assessed with an
acceptable result.

The evidence that ensures the presence of PCI controls that are derived from FIPS 201-1
requirements and its related documents as well as OMB Memoranda, and verified through
appropriate assessments, establishes the capability of a PCI. However, accreditation is generally
based not merely on the demonstration of capability, but also on the presence of certain
organizational characteristics that will provide a high degree of confidence to the Assessor that
the demonstrated capabilities will be carried out in a dependable and sustainable manner. This
dependability measure, or reliability (as it is generally called), has to be established by
adequately assessing that a PCI has the desired organizational characteristics, including adequate
facilities, appropriate equipment, trained personnel, adequate resources, trustworthy
management, and properly vetted operations staff. Hence, the accreditation methodology
includes a set of PCI controls, verification of which establishes the reliability of a PCI. This set
of controls is grouped under the accreditation focus area “Facility and Personnel Readiness”.
These reliability-relevant PCI controls are formulated, based on “commonly accepted security
readiness measures” that have evolved in response to lessons learned in security incidents that
have taken place due to threats, such as insider attacks, and risks, such as physical security
lapses. In addition to the controls provided herein, an organization may develop additional
mission-specific controls that will contribute towards the overall reliability of the PCI to meet the
organization’s mission needs.

Table 1 provides a listing of the four PIV Accreditation Topics (PATs) and the Accreditation
Focus Areas under each topic:

                                  Organizational Preparedness

PCI control represents how one or more requirements from FIPS 201-1 and its related documents
can be satisfied. PCI controls are sequentially numbered using the two-character identifier
assigned to the Accreditation Focus Area under which they are listed. Table 2 shows the

                              the head of the organization.                            Registration Requirements
          Table 2 - PAT, Accreditation Focus Area, and PCI Control Relationships

Irrespective of whether the information systems utilized within the PCI and its facilities are
categorized at low, moderate, or high impact levels according to FIPS 199, the same set of PCI
controls apply, regardless of an individual system’s impact level. Furthermore, nothing precludes
a PCI from implementing additional controls to ensure a higher level of confidence in mitigating
risks associated with issuing PIV Cards.

3.2 Implementing PCI Controls

Each PCI control must be properly implemented, managed, and monitored in order for the PCI to
be accredited. Depending on how an organization decides to implement their HSPD-12 program,
the authority to implement some of the controls may not directly come under the PCI
Management (due to outsourcing of certain PCI processes or using the PCI facilities of other
organizations). However, it is still the responsibility of the PCI management to ensure that these
PCI controls are being deployed, enforced, and maintained by its service provider.

3.2.1 PCI Controls implemented at the Organization or Facility Level
The nature of each PCI control dictates where it is implemented. Controls that are common to or
impact multiple PCI processes are implemented at the organization level. The development of


                                                    24
the PCI operations plan is an example of a PCI control implemented at the organizational level.
Generally, controls specific to a process are implemented at the facility where that process or
function is carried out. For example, the control that states that a “1:1 biometric match of the
applicant against the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record must be
performed before releasing the PIV Card to the applicant” is implemented at a card
activation/issuance facility.




                                               25
4. ASSESSMENTS

An assessment is a set of activities performed by the Assessor to gain assurance that the PIV
Card Issuer (PCI) controls have been implemented properly and meet their required function or
purpose. Understanding the overall effectiveness of the PCI controls implemented in the PCI and
its facilities is essential in determining the risk to the organization’s overall mission, and forms
the basis for the accreditation decision by the Designated Accreditation Authority (DAA).

An Assessor must– (i) compile evidence that the PCI controls employed in the PCI are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired results; and (ii) present
this evidence in a manner such that the DAA can make a credible, risk-based decision about the
operation of the PCI.

The focus of an assessment is the PCI controls, each of which is designed to satisfy one or more
specific requirements from FIPS 201-1 and related documents. The objective for the Assessor is
to use the assessment procedures associated with each PCI control (described in Appendix G) as
a means to measure if the PCI being assessed meets the requirements. The assessment
procedures are designed to facilitate the gathering of evidence that PCI controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.

In preparation for a PCI assessment, the Assessor performs the following two preparatory steps:

   •   Determination of the accreditation boundary to understand the target of the assessment.
       The accreditation boundary dictates which PCIFs and outsourced services are to be
       included in the assessment.

   •   Review of the PCI operations plan to determine which PCI controls are implemented at
       the organizational level and which at the facility level. This analysis should provide the
       Assessor with an understanding of where different responsibilities lie within the PCI and
       how to address them during the assessment.

In cases where a PCI has outsourced functions, the PCI is responsible for ensuring that the
external service provider has implemented the control. During the assessment, it is the service
provider’s responsibility to provide documentation to the Assessor regarding the implementation
of that control. If results from a previous assessment of the service provider (provided the current
assessment is part of re-accreditation after substantial changes) can be referenced, the Assessor
may elect to incorporate these results (not exceeding one year) or re-do part or all of the
assessment. The extent of re-use of the results of the previous assessment is entirely at the
discretion of the Assessor.

PCI controls implemented at the organizational level generally need to be assessed only once,
since these controls span across the entire PCI and its facilities. In other words, these controls
may not be re-assessed when the accreditation boundary changes (e.g., due to addition of
facilities). Examples of organizational level controls include the set of controls under the
accreditation focus areas Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO) and Assignment
of Roles and Responsibilities (RR).




                                                 26
There are certain controls that although they are put in place at the organizational level, they
need to be reviewed at the PCIF level. An example of such a control artifact is
“contingency/disaster recovery plan for information systems”. Though the development of the
contingency/disaster recovery plan is an organizational level control, a review of this control
artifact is needed whenever new information systems in the existing facilities or new facilities
are added to ensure that these new systems are brought within the scope of the plan.

Unlike organization level PCI controls, facility level PCI controls need to be assessed
individually at each facility. A facility is often designated based on the type of PCI process it
performs (exceptions are the Sponsorship Process and Adjudication Process). Hence, for
example, if there are multiple facilities for enrollment/identify proofing (e.g., multiple
enrollment centers), assessment of the PCI controls under the focus area Enrollment/Identity
Proofing should take place in each of the enrollment centers. However, if all facilities are
operating using uniform operational procedures and underlying information systems, it is
acceptable to perform assessments at facilities that are selected randomly or through some other
established criteria (e.g., geographical region or service provider).

Prior assessments may be used as a starting point for the assessment of a PCI. While past
assessments provide insight into the implementation and operation of the PCI, a number of
factors affect the validity of past assessments. These include updates in policies and procedures,
changes in systems/technology, and turnover in employees and contractors. Any significant
changes in one or more of these factors should trigger a new assessment of the PCI. The
Assessor must validate whether a PCI is currently operating as expected using the given
assessment procedures, including specially tailored or augmented procedures. It is only through a
current valid assessment of PCI controls that the Assessor and Organization Identity
Management Official (OIMO) will have confidence in the reliability of the PCI and its facilities.

The use of automated security controls, if reliably implemented and maintained in information
systems, results in a high assurance of the protection of information and other organizational
assets. Human involvement results in more variability in how PCI controls are implemented and
operated, as security and reliability depend on many factors, including an individual’s training,
knowledge, motivation, experience, and management. Relying on humans for data protection,
rather than on reliable, automated security mechanisms, makes it critical that trust and reliability
assessments of management, operators, and maintenance personnel are current and up-to-date.
Many of the assessment procedures rely on interactions among the Assessor, PCI management,
and facilities staff. Interviews with all involved personnel and observations of all PCI processes
are required. On-site visits, real-time observations, and reviews of processes are essential, as the
Assessor must not rely solely on documentation to determine if a given PCI control has been
implemented.

4.1 Assessment Methods

One or more assessment procedures are associated with each PCI control listed in Appendix G.
An assessment procedure is carried out using one or more of the following assessment methods.
(The assessment methods associated with an assessment procedure are given in parenthesis in
Appendix G)



                                                 27
    •   Review – An evaluation of documentation that describes plans, policies, and procedures
        in order to verify that they are adequate, understood by the PCI management and
        operations personnel, and that they are in accordance with applicable policies,
        regulations, standards, technical guidelines, and organizational guidance.
    •   Interview – a directed conversation with one or more PCI personnel in which both pre-
        established and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
        encouraged, and conclusions reached.
    •   Observe – a real-time viewing of PCI processes in operation, including all information
        system components of the PCI involved in creation, issuance, maintenance, and
        replacement of PIV Cards.
    •   Test – an evaluation of a component against a set of relevant PIV specifications using
        applicable test methods and metrics (as given in the associated assessment procedure in
        Appendix G).

These methods are intended to provide the Assessor with sufficient, precise, accurate, and
relevant evidence regarding an accreditation topic and focus area. One or more assessment
methods may be required to determine if the PCI has satisfactorily met the objective outlined for
that assessment procedure. Assessment results are used by the Assessor to determine the overall
effectiveness of the PCI control.

Table 3 shows an example of the relationships among a PAT, an Accreditation Focus Area,
several PCI controls, and their assessment procedures.

                 Table 3 - Sample PCI Controls with Assessment Procedures

Some organizations may need to customize some of the PCI controls to meet their specific
characteristics and mission needs. In such cases, the associated assessment procedures may also
have to be customized/augmented to ensure proper implementation of these controls.

4.2 The Assessment Report

The Assessment report contains the results of the assessment in a format that facilitates
reviewing by the DAA. The DAA must evaluate the information in the Assessment report in
order to make a sound, credible decision regarding the residual risk of authorizing the operations
of the PCI.

An Assessment report template is provided in Appendix E. The report is organized by
Accreditation Focus Area. For each PCI control, it must be documented as to which entity is
responsible for the implementation of that control (the organization or an external service
provider) and if the PCI control is at the organizational or facility level.

 Card Activation/Issuance Process

 PCI Control Identifier— AI-7
 PCI Control Description— The issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the applicant against
 the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the enrollment record. On successful match, the
 PIV Card shall be released to the applicant
 PCI Control Owner/ Control Level — External Service Provider/Facility Level
 Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
 Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
 before the card is released to the applicant.
 Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
 documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
 this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
 lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff.
 Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
 include a clear description of this task in the process.

                             Figure 4 - Sample Assessment Report

The assessment result associated with each PCI control shall be one of the following:
   • Satisfied
   • Partially Satisfied
   • Not Satisfied
   • Not Applicable

After carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor records his/her conclusion in one of
two ways: MET, NOT MET. Using the list of conclusions pertaining to assessment procedures
associated with a PCI control, the assessment result (which is one of the 4 outcomes listed
above) is arrived at as follows:
   •   If the conclusion from all assessment procedures is MET, then the assessment result for
       the PCI control is “Satisfied”
   •   If some of the conclusions are NOT MET, then the assessment result for the PCI control
       is marked as either “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied”, depending on whether or not
       any of the underlying tasks in the assessment procedures are critical (i.e., they represent
       the only way to meet the PCI control’s objective). An example of an assessment that
       resulted in “Partially Satisfied” is given in Figure 4. In this instance, there is an
       awareness of a task requirement, and the task itself is being carried out, but the reference
       to the task is missing in the document.




                                                30
In drawing a conclusion after carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor must consider
the potential subjective and objective aspects of the assessment methods used (e.g., interviews,
document reviews, observations, and tests) for that assessment procedure. Deficiencies that
result in “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied” must be reported by the Assessor. The Assessor
must also outline the potential adverse impacts if the PCI control is deployed with the identified
deficiencies.

The assessment report template provides the means for recording the assessment result for each
PCI control. The assessment results for all PCI controls are aggregated to generate the
assessment report for a PCI accreditation focus area. The set of PCI Accreditation Focus Area
Reports is aggregated to generate a PCI accreditation topic report. Finally, the group of PCI
Accreditation Topic Reports is used to generate the overall PCI Assessment Report and an
accompanying Executive Summary (intended for Senior Management).

5.0 ACCREDITATION
The accreditation of a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) consists of four phases: (i) Initiation; (ii)
Assessment; (iii) Accreditation; and (iv) Monitoring. Each phase consists of tasks and sub-tasks
that are to be carried out by the responsible officials (e.g., the Designated Accreditation
Authority (DAA), Assessor, Organization Identity Management Official (OIMO), and PCI
Facility (PCIF) Manager(s)). Figure 5 provides a view of the accreditation phases, including the
tasks associated with each phase. A table of accreditation phases, tasks, sub-tasks, and the
official responsible for each is provided in Appendix H.

5.1 Initiation Phase

The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) resource identification; and (iii)
operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
PCI is prepared for the assessment, including having all the resources and documentation in
place. The other purpose of this phase is to include the DAA early in the process in order to
assure success of the assessment and accreditation.
        Task 1: Preparation
The objectives of this task are to prepare for accreditation by reviewing the PCI operations plan
and confirming that the plan is consistent with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
201-1 and the template provided herein.

                Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the PCI and its operations have been fully described
                and documented in the PCI’s operations plan.


                                                     32
               Responsibility: OIMO
               Guidance: The PCI operation plan includes, at a minimum, the sections defined
               in the operations plan template in Appendix D. It is the OIMO’s responsibility to
               ensure that the organization’s PCI operations plan incorporates a complete and
               accurate description of the PCI’s operations. If a process or function is provided
               by an external service provider, their operating procedures should be documented
               and incorporated by reference in the PCI operations plan. In this case, the
               operations plan includes a pointer, guiding the reader to additional documentation
               and information.

               Subtask 1.2: Confirm that processes followed at the PCI Facility are conducted
               in accordance with the policies and procedures specified in the PCI operations
               plan and are documented in standard operating procedures.
               Responsibility: OIMO, PCIF Manager
               Guidance: Even though PCI Facilities may be following requirements from
               FIPS 201-1, their processes need to be consistent with those prescribed by the
               PCI’s operations plan and documented in standard operating procedures.

       Task 2: Resource Identification
The objectives of the resource identification task are to– (i) identify and document the resources
required for assisting with the assessment; (ii) identify the scope of the assessment and
accreditation boundary; and (ii) prepare a plan of assessment activities indicating the proposed
schedule and key milestones.

               Subtask 2.1: Identify the Senior Authorizing Official (SAO), Designated
               Accreditation Authority (DAA), Privacy Official (PO), PCIF Managers, Assessor,
               and other key personnel at the facility level who are performing functions, such as
               enrollment/identity proofing, card production, and card activation/issuance.
               Maintenance personnel also should be contacted to provide requested assessment
               information to the Assessor.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: Notify these individuals of the upcoming assessment, and inform
               them of the need for their participation during the process.

               Subtask 2.2: Determine the accreditation boundary for the PCI.

               Responsibility: OIMO; DAA

               Guidance: The accreditation boundary determines the target of the assessment. In
               preparation for a PCI assessment, the OIMO and DAA should identify which
               PCIFs and external service providers are to be included. This ensures that
               functions performed and processes managed by the external service provider are


                                                33
              considered during the accreditation process. An organization may want to include
              only those PCIFs that are ready to operate; other facilities can be assessed at a
              later date.

              Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the accreditation
              of the PCI, and prepare a plan for execution of the assessment.

              Responsibility: OIMO; DAA

              Guidance: The level of effort required for an assessment depends on numerous
              factors— (i) the size the PCI; (ii) the location and number of its facilities; (iii) the
              level of outsourcing utilized by the PCI; and (iv) the number of cards being, or to
              be issued. By examining factors that could influence the complexity of the
              assessment, the organization can make informed judgments about the size of the
              assessment team, the resources needed to support the assessment, and the time-
              frame for completing it.

       Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are: (i) determine if the
requirements of FIPS 201-1 have been implemented; (ii) evaluate the PCI operations plan and
revise as needed; and (iii) obtain acceptance of the plan by the DAA prior to conducting an
assessment of the PCI controls.

              Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required PCI controls documented in the
              organization’s PCI operation plan and then confirm that they have been
              implemented properly.

              Responsibility: DAA; OIMO

              Guidance: Since the PCI controls serve as the basis for the assessment, review
              the PCI’s documentation and operations plan to identify the controls that must be
              implemented before investing time in assessment activities such as interviews or
              testing. The operations plan must document each PCI control, whether it is
              organization or facility specific, the owner of the PCI control, and how the PCI
              control is implemented.

              Subtask 3.2: Analyze the PCI operations plan to determine if there are
              deficiencies in satisfying all the policies, procedures, and other requirements in
              FIPS 201-1 that could result in a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)
              being issued. After discussing the discovered deficiencies in the documentation
              and operations plan with the OIMO, the organization may still want to continue
              with the assessment, if it has determined that it can address all deficiencies within
              the time period of the current assessment. In this situation, the DAA can either
              authorize continuation of the assessment or terminate the assessment effort
              depending upon the evaluation of the PCI’s ability to address the deficiencies.



                                                 34
               Responsibility: DAA, OIMO

               Guidance: The operations plan should adequately specify the policies,
               procedures, and processes of the PCI so that, subsequent to an initial review,
               deficiencies that could lead to an eventual DATO may be identified for the PCI.

               Subtask 3.3: Verify that the PCI operations plan is acceptable.

               Responsibility: DAA

               Guidance: If the PCI operations plan is deemed acceptable, the DAA should
               authorize the accreditation processes to advance to the next phase. Acceptance of
               the PCI operations plan signifies that the resources required to initiate and
               complete the accreditation activities may be deployed.

5.2 Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase consists of two tasks— (i) PCI control assessment; and (ii) assessment
documentation. The purpose of this phase is to determine the extent to which the requirements of
FIPS 201-1 are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcomes. This phase also specifies actions to be taken to correct all identified deficiencies. An
analysis of the impact of identified deficiencies that cannot be corrected or mitigated efficiently
on the reliable operation of the PCI should be conducted and documented. Successful
completion of this phase should provide the DAA with the information needed to make an
appropriate accreditation decision.

       Task 4: PCI Control Assessment
The objectives of this task are to— (i) initiate and conduct an assessment of the PCI controls;
and (ii) document the results of the assessment. The Assessor shall first verify the acceptability
of all documentation, including the operations plan and previous assessments, along with all
relevant Federal laws, regulations, standards, and directives. PCI control assessment should then
commence. The Assessor should schedule interviews, schedule real-time observations of PCI
processes, and initiate all needed testing of the PIV Card and PCI information system
components. Once the Assessor has gathered the results of the assessment procedures,
descriptions of all discovered deficiencies shall be prepared, along with recommendations for
removing these deficiencies.


               Subtask 4.1: Review the suggested and selected assessment methods for each
               PCI control in preparation for the assessment.

               Responsibility: Assessor

               Guidance: Based on the accreditation boundary, the scope of the assessment
               should be established. The Assessor should review the selected assessment
               procedures (based on the scope of the assessment) in order to plan and coordinate


                                                35
activities for the assessment. For instance, if a particular PCI control requires the
observation of a particular process, the Assessor will need to schedule this activity
in a timely fashion after coordinating it with the PCI’s or PCIF’s management.
The Assessor, as directed by the DAA, may supplement the assessment methods
and procedures recommended in these guidelines. Assessment methods and
procedures may be created or tailored for a particular PCI.

Subtask 4.2: Assemble all documentation and supporting materials necessary
for the assessment of the PCI; if these documents include previous assessments,
review the findings and determine if they are applicable to the current assessment.

Responsibility: OIMO; Assessor

Guidance: The OIMO assists the Assessor in gathering all relevant documents
and supporting materials from the organization that will be required during the
assessment of the PCI. Central to this effort is the PCI operations plan. The PCI’s
operations shall be completely described in the operations plan. The PCI
operations plan may include by reference, or point to, the supporting materials. In
this case, the OIMO will also need to gather this supporting material for the
Assessor. Examples of other documentation include: (i) letters of appointment;
(ii) privacy-related documentation; (iii) information forms utilized within the PCI;
(iv) documentation from each outsourced service provider, including control
implementation specifics, support and service level agreements, and contracts; (v)
standard operating procedures for the PCIFs within the accreditation boundary for
the PCI; and (vi) signed accreditation letters under SP 800-37 for all information
systems within the PCI.

When previous assessments exist, including the one on which the current
Authorization to Operate (ATO) is based, the Assessor is strongly encouraged to
review these results. The Assessor may satisfy some of the PCI control
assessment requirements by reviewing and referencing previous assessment
report(s). Although previous assessments cannot be used as a substitute for the
current assessment, they provide a snapshot view of the PCI and highlight
problems that may have existed in the past.

Subtask 4.3: Assess the required PCI controls using the prescribed assessment
procedures found in Appendix G.

Responsibility: Assessor

Guidance: The Assessor performs the assessment procedures selected for each
PCI control to assess if the PCI controls have been implemented correctly, are
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes. The Assessor uses the
assessment methods specified in Section 4.1. Documentation collected in the
previous task is reviewed, and any deficiencies are identified. Interviews can be
used as an opportunity to clarify issues encountered during a review of the PCI
documentation, as well as to determine the expertise of the personnel performing


                                 36
              key functions with the PCI and its facilities. Processes need to be observed to
              ensure that they are being followed as documented and tests executed to
              determine if the PIV components have been configured and are operating in a
              PIV-compliant manner.

              If the PCI and its facilities are being assessed, all the PCI controls will need to be
              assessed. If PIV services have been outsourced to an external provider, the
              Assessor shall verify that the PCI controls applying to those services have been
              assessed, and the reliability of the service provider has been found satisfactory. If
              a PCI and its facilities have already been assessed and are operating under a
              current ATO, and the purpose of the assessment is to add a facility(s) to the
              accreditation letter, the Assessor may reuse the results of a previous assessment
              for the organization level PCI controls and then assess a random sample of PCIFs.

              Subtask 4.4: Prepare the assessment report.

              Responsibility: Assessor

              Guidance: The assessment report contains— (i) the results of the assessment; (ii)
              recommendations for correcting deficiencies; and (iii) the residual risk to the
              organization if those deficiencies are not corrected or mitigated. The assessment
              report is the Assessor’s statement of the results of analyzing and evaluating the
              PCI’s implementation of controls. The sample assessment report template in
              Appendix E should be used as a format for documenting the results after assessing
              the PCI controls.

       Task 5: Assessment Documentation
This task consists of the Assessor submitting the assessment report to the OIMO and the latter
adding the PCI operations plan (revised if necessary) and the corrective actions plan (CAP) to
generate an accreditation submission package for the DAA. In situations where the assessment
report contains deficiencies, the OIMO may choose to address some deficiencies based on the
recommendations by the Assessor and revise the PCI operations plan (if needed), even before
submitting the package for accreditation.


              Subtask 5.1: Provide the OIMO with the assessment report.

              Responsibility: Assessor

              Guidance: The OIMO relies on the expertise, experience, and judgment of the
              Assessor to: (i) provide recommendations on how to correct deficiencies in the
              planned or performed operations; and (ii) to understand the potential impacts of
              those deficiencies. The OIMO may choose to act on selected recommendations of
              the Assessor before the accreditation package is finalized. To optimize the
              utilization of resources organization-wide, any actions taken by the OIMO prior to
              the final accreditation decision must be coordinated with the DAA. The Assessor



                                                37
               reviews any changes made in response to the corrective actions and revises the
               assessment report, as appropriate.

               Subtask 5.2: Revise the PCI operations plan (if necessary) and implement its
               new provisions.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: The revised PCI operations plan must include all changes made in
               response to recommendations for corrective actions from the Assessor.

               Subtask 5.3: Prepare the corrective actions plan (CAP).

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: The CAP, one of the three primary documents in the accreditation
               submission package, describes actions that must be taken by the OIMO to correct
               deficiencies identified in the Assessment phase. The CAP identifies— (i) the
               tasks to be accomplished; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; (iii)
               scheduled completion dates for the tasks, and (iv) the person designated as
               responsible for completing each of the tasks.

               Subtask 5.4: Assemble the accreditation submission package and submit to the
               DAA.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: The OIMO is responsible for the assembly and compilation of the
               accreditation submission package with inputs from the OIMO. The accreditation
               submission package shall contain: (i) the final assessment report; (ii) the CAP;
               (iii) the revised PCI operations plan; and (iv) the SP 800-37 accreditation letters
               for all information systems within the PCI. The OIMO may wish to consult other
               key organization participants (e.g., the Assessor, PO) prior to submitting the
               accreditation submission package to the DAA. The accreditation submission
               package can be submitted in either paper or electronic form. The contents of the
               accreditation submission package must be protected in accordance with
               organization policy.

5.3 Accreditation Phase

The Accreditation Phase consists of two tasks— (i) making an appropriate accreditation
decision; and (ii) completing the accreditation documentation. Upon completion of this phase,
the OIMO will have— (i) an authorization to operate the PCI services as defined in its operations
plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions; or (iii) a denial
of authorization to operate.



                                                 38
       Task 6: Accreditation Decision
The accreditation decision task determines if the assessment phase has been satisfactorily
completed so that a recommendation concerning the operation of the PCI can be made with
assurance. The DAA, working with the Assessor, reviews the contents of the assessment
submission package, the identified and uncorrected or un-correctable deficiencies, the potential
impacts on each organization using the PCI’s services, and the CAP in determining the final risk
to the organization(s) and the acceptability of that risk in light of the organization’s mission.


               Subtask 6.1: Review the assessment decision package to see if it is complete
               and that all applicable PCI controls have been fully assessed using the designated
               assessment procedures.

               Responsibility: DAA

               Guidance: Coverage for all PCI controls and proper adherence to assessment
               procedures and appropriate assessment methods helps to create confidence in
               assessment findings and is the main objective of the assessment review. Part of
               the assessment review also includes understanding the impact of the identified
               deficiencies on the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.

               Subtask 6.2: Determine if the risk to the organization’s operations, assets, or
               potentially affected individuals is acceptable, and arrive at an accreditation
               decision.

               Responsibility: DAA

               Guidance: After the completion of the assessment review, the DAA has a clear
               understanding of the impact of deficiencies. This helps the DAA to judge which
               deficiencies are of greatest concern to the organization and which can be tolerated
               without creating unreasonable organization-level risk. The CAP is also considered
               in determining the risk to the organization in terms of when and how the OIMO
               intends to address the known deficiencies. The DAA may consult the OIMO,
               Assessor, or other organization officials before completing the final risk
               evaluation. This risk evaluation in turn determines the degree of acceptability of
               PCI operations. The logic for using the latter as the basis for an accreditation
               decision is described in Section 2.9.

       Task 7: Accreditation Documentation
The accreditation documentation task includes— (i) completing and transmitting the
accreditation decision package to the appropriate individuals and organizations; and (ii) updating
the PCI’s operations plan.




                                                 39
               Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the accreditation decision package, in either
               paper or electronic form, to the OIMO and any other organization officials having
               interests, roles, or responsibilities in the PCI.

               Responsibility: DAA

               Guidance: The accreditation decision package, including the accreditation
               decision letter, should be transmitted to the OIMO. Upon receipt of the
               accreditation decision package, the OIMO must review the authorization and its
               terms and conditions. The original accreditation decision package must be kept on
               file by the OIMO. The DAA shall retain copies of the contents of the
               accreditation decision package. The accreditation decision package must be
               appropriately safeguarded and stored, whenever possible, in a centralized
               organization filing system to ensure accessibility. The accreditation decision
               package shall be available to authorized auditors and oversight organizations upon
               request. The accreditation decision package must be retained in accordance with
               the organization’s records retention policy. The PCI and specific facilities are
               accredited for a maximum of three (3) years from the date of the ATO. After the
               period ends, re-accreditation must be performed.

               Subtask 7.2: Update the PCI’s operations plan.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: The operations plan must be updated to reflect all changes made as the
               result of assessment and accreditation. All conditions of PCI operations that are
               set forth in the accreditation decision must also be noted in the plan.

5.4 Monitoring Phase

The Monitoring Phase consists of two tasks— (i) operations plan maintenance; and (ii) annual
lifecycle walkthrough. Based on the importance of reliably creating and issuing PIV Cards, it is
imperative that once the accreditation is completed, the PCI is monitored to ensure that policies,
procedures, and processes remain in effect as originally intended. There can be significant
changes in a PCI’s policies, management, operations personnel, and available technology during
a three-year ATO. These changes must be monitored so that the organization minimizes
exposing itself to security and privacy threats existing or arising in the PCI. For example, if there
is a significant staff turnover in the PCI, the organization must be sure that the new PCI staff is
enrolling applicants and issuing cards using the same reliable processes that were previously
approved.

In order to facilitate the monitoring of a PCI without undue burden in activities and paperwork,
only two activities are required during this phase: maintenance of the operations plan and an
annual lifecycle walkthrough of PCI operations. The latter entails reviewing all the services and
functions of a PCI and its facilities for continued reliability. The annual walkthrough must cover
a PIV Card’s lifecycle from sponsorship to maintenance. Observation of the full lifecycle of a
card ensures that all processes are still reliably operating as assessed during the accreditation.


                                                 40
       Task 8: Operations Plan Update
A PCI’s operations plan is the primary description of what and how PIV Card issuing services
are provided. It is essential that this document be updated as changes occur in the PCI’s
operations. The PCI management will be able to analyze the impact of changes as they occur and
will be significantly better prepared when re-accreditation is required.

               Subtask 8.1: Document all relevant changes in the PCI within the operations
               plan.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: In addition to the policies, procedures, and processes that must be
               documented if changes are made, the organization shall update the operations plan
               if changes to the PCI information system, the PIV Card, privacy policies, roles
               and responsibilities, or PCI controls are made.

               Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the PCI and determine
               the impact of such changes.

               Responsibility: OIMO

               Guidance: If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the PCI
               could affect the reliability of the PCI’s operations, the changes and impact on the
               PCI must be reported to the DAA, corrective actions must be initiated, and the
               CAP must be updated. In instances where major changes have occurred, the PCI
               must be re-accredited.

       Task 9: Annual Lifecycle Walkthrough
The annual lifecycle walkthrough is a monitoring activity to be performed initially by the PCI
when its PIV Card issuing services begin, and annually thereafter. The OIMO (or designated
appointee) is responsible for observing and reviewing the entire lifecycle of a PIV Card. This
walkthrough should provide an accurate snapshot of the PCI’s operations and reliability at a
point in time. By walking through the PIV Card lifecycle, from sponsorship to issuance,
including maintenance, the operations of the PCI can be examined as an integrated entity. During
the walkthrough, the OIMO (or designated appointee) shall observe all processes involving the
PIV Card, comparing them against the requirements defined in the PCI controls. This activity
shall be performed every year after each accreditation until re-accreditation begins. All
identified deficiencies in reliable operations shall be sent to the DAA for review and analysis.
Any potential impact to the reliability of the PCI’s operations and risk to the organization shall
be documented and presented to the OIMO and the DAA.

               Subtask 9.1: Observe all the processes involved in getting a PIV Card, including
               those from sponsorship to maintenance. Observe each process and compare its
               controls against the applicable list of required PCI controls. If a PCI has several
               facilities, this process should be repeated using randomly selected PCIFs.



                                                 41
Responsibility: OIMO (or designated appointee)

Guidance: As part of the walkthrough, the OIMO (or designated appointee)
observes the processes followed for new employees and contractors (if different)
as well as PIV Card maintenance processes, such as card termination, reissuance,
or renewals. The OIMO (or designated appointee) observes each process and
compares it against the documented steps for the PCI and the associated PCI
controls. An annual walkthrough is required until re-accreditation is initiated.

Subtask 9.2: The results of the lifecycle walkthrough are summarized in a report
to the DAA. Deficiencies must be highlighted, along with corrective actions that
must be implemented to correct any deficiencies.

Responsibility: OIMO, DAA

Guidance: The OIMO (or designated appointee) shall document the results of
the walkthrough. The results shall be recorded in the assessment report template
included in Appendix E. All deficiencies should be highlighted, and a plan for
correcting each deficiency shall be documented. The DAA shall decide if any
deficiency is significant enough to require a change of the PCI’s authorization-to-
operate status.

Below is a template to use when generating the assessment report. This is to be completed for
each PCI control. An example using a specific PCI control follows.

PCI Control Description—
PCI Control Owner / Control Level — (External Service Provider, Organization specific, Facility
specific)
Assessment Result— (Satisfied, Partially Satisfied, Not Satisfied, Not Applicable)
Assessment Findings—
Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact—

Card Activation/Issuance Process
PCI Control Identifier— AI-7
PCI Control Description— The issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the applicant against
the biometric included in the PIV Card or in the enrollment record. On a successful match, the
PIV Card may be released to the applicant
PCI Control Owner— External Service Provider, Facility Specific
Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
before the card is released to the applicant.
Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff.
Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
include a clear description of this task in the process.

Subject: PCI Accreditation Package for [PCI]


An assessment of the [PCI NAME] located at [PCI Location and PCIF Locations] has been
conducted in accordance with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-79-1, Guidelines for the
Accreditation of PIV Card Issuers and the [ORGANIZATION] policy on PCI accreditation. The
attached accreditation package contains— (i) the PCI operations plan; (ii) the assessment report;
(iii) a corrective actions plan (CAP); and (iv) An SP 800-37 accreditation letter for each
information system within the PCI.

The PCI operations plan, its policies, procedures, and processes have been assessed by
[ASSESSOR] using the assessment methods and procedures defined in SP 800-79-1 and specified
in the assessment report to determine the extent to which the requirements under HSPD-12 and
FIPS 201-1 are exhibited. The CAP describes the corrective actions that we plan to perform to
remove or reduce any remaining deficiencies detected in the PCI’s operations.

From: Designated Accreditation Authority                                      Date:

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI]


After reviewing the results of the accreditation package of the [PCI], I have determined that the
PCI’s policies, procedures, and processes are in compliance both with FIPS 201-1 and our
organization’s own policies, regulations and standards. Accordingly, I am issuing an
authorization to operate (ATO) the PCI’s services. The PCI is accredited without any restrictions
or limitations. This accreditation is my formal declaration that the requirements of HSPD-12 are
being satisfied by the PCI.

This ATO also applies to facilities under the PCI. Included is a list of facilities authorized to
operate under this accreditation decision.

This accreditation and ATO will remain in effect for 3 years from the date of this letter if— (i)
all required documentation is updated annually; (ii) a lifecycle walkthrough is completed
annually and the results sent to me within thirty (30) days of completion; and (iii) no deficiencies
are identified during the walkthrough that would increase the risk to the organization’s mission.

A copy of this letter and all supporting accreditation documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

From: Designated Accreditation Authority                                      Date:

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI], I have determined that the PCI does
not satisfy the requirements identified in FIPS 201-1 and the organization’s policies, regulations,
and standards. However, I have determined that there is an overarching need for the PCI to
provide the needed services due to mission necessity and other considerations. Accordingly, I am
issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO) the PCI’s services. Operation of the PCI must
be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and conditions during the IATO period. The
PCI is not considered accredited during the IATO period.

This IATO also applies to facilities under the PCI. Included is a list of facilities authorized to
operate during this interim period, along with specific limitations or restrictions that apply.

This interim authorization to operate is valid for a maximum till close of business on <date>
[not to exceed three months]. This interim authorization will remain in effect as long as— (i) the
required status reports for the PCI are submitted to this office every month; (ii) the problems or
deficiencies reported from the accreditation do not result in additional risk that is deemed
unacceptable; and (iii) continued progress is being made in reducing or eliminating the
deficiencies in accordance with the corrective actions plan (CAP). At the end of IATO period,
the PCI must either be accredited and authorized to operate, or the authorization for further
operation will be denied. A second IATO will be granted only in extenuating circumstances.
This office will review the CAP submitted with the accreditation package during the IATO
period and monitor progress on removal or reduction of concerns and discrepancies before re-
accreditation is initiated.

A copy of this letter and all supporting accreditation documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.

From: Designated Accreditation Authority                                    Date:

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Accreditation Decision for [PCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI] and the supporting evidence provided
in the associated accreditation package, I have determined that the requirements identified in
FIPS 201-1 and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards are not being exhibited by
the PCI. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) to the PCI and
its facilities. The PCI is not accredited and [MAY NOT BE PLACED INTO OPERATION or ALL
CURRENT OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED].

The corrective actions plan (CAP) is to be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Re- accreditation is
to be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of correcting the
deficiencies.

A copy of this letter and all supporting accreditation documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
