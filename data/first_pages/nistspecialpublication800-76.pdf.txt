                                                       Executive Summary


The Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12 called for new standards to be adopted governing the
interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical and logical access to Federal government locations
and systems. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS 201), was developed to establish standards for identity credentials. This
document, Special Publication 800-76 (SP 800-76), is a companion document to FIPS 201. It describes
technical acquisition and formatting specifications for the biometric credentials of the PIV system, including the
PIV Card1 itself. It enumerates procedures and formats for fingerprints and facial images by restricting values
and practices included generically in published biometric standards. The primary design objective behind these
particular specifications is high performance universal interoperability. For the preparation of biometric data
suitable for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background check, SP 800-76 references FBI
documentation, including the ANSI/NIST Fingerprint Standard and the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission
Specification. This document does not preclude use of other biometric modalities in conjunction with the PIV
card.

    A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an individual that contains stored identity credentials (e.g., photograph,
       cryptographic keys, biometric data) so that the claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by
       another person (human readable and verifiable) or an automated process (computer readable and verifiable).

1.     Introduction


1.1    Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in furtherance
of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing
adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not
apply to national security systems. This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
Appendix III.
This recommendation has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by non-governmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this document should be taken to
contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of
Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding
the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or any
other Federal official.

1.2    Purpose and Scope
FIPS 201 [FIPS], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors, defines
procedures for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV
Card usage. FIPS also defines the structure of an identity credential which includes biometric data.
Requirements concerning cryptographic protection of the biometric data are also described in [FIPS] and in
[800-78].
This document contains technical specifications for biometric data mandated in [FIPS]. These specifications
reflect the design goals of interoperability and performance of the PIV Card. This specification addresses image
acquisition to support the background check, fingerprint template creation, retention, and authentication. The
goals are addressed by citing biometric standards normatively and by enumerating requirements where the
standards include options and branches. In such cases, a biometric profile can be used to elucidate required
versus optional content. This document goes further by constraining implementers' interpretation of the
standards. Such restrictions are designed to ease implementation, assure conformity, facilitate interoperability,
and ensure performance, in a manner tailored for PIV applications.
Thus, this document specifies various pieces of biometric data, and the processes used during and after their
acquisition. However, for both logical and physical access applications, and for applications using biometric
data stored either on or off the PIV Card, this document neither requires nor precludes the use of:
      1. the PIV Card fingerprint templates;
      2. specific authentication paradigms such as match-on-card;
      3. data from other biometric modalities (e.g., hand geometry, iris, etc.);
      4. data formatted according to other standards;
      5. data whose format is proprietary or otherwise undisclosed.
This document does however specify that all biometric data to be embedded in the Common Biometric
Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) structure of section 6. This document provides an overview of the

                                                                                                                      7

strategy that can be used for testing conformance to the standard. It is not meant to be a comprehensive set of
test requirements that can be used for certification or demonstration of compliance to the specifications in this
document.

1.3   Audience, Assumptions, and Overview
This document is targeted at Federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are assumed to have a
working knowledge of biometric standards and applications. This document defines, in section 3, the fingerprint
acquisition process, and the retention and minutia generation formats. In section 4 it puts requirements on
fingerprint mediated verification implementations, and specifies, in section 5, a facial image acquisition and
retention format. Section 6 defines the generic header for all PIV biometric data. Sections 7 and 8 cover,
respectively, certification and conformance tests. Finally section 9 is the bibliography.

3.        Fingerprint Enrollment


3.1       Scope
The specifications in this section pertain to the production of the mandatory PIV biometric enrollment data.
That is, this section provides specifications for acquisition, formatting, and storage of fingerprint images and
templates. The following is an overview of the material covered in this section.
      +    Section 3.2 gives specifications for the use of fingerprint scanners to capture fingerprint images for PIV
           Registration;

      +    Section 3.3 gives the format for fingerprint templates stored on the PIV Card;

      +    Section 3.4 gives specifications for fingerprint images retained by agencies;

      +    Section 3.5 specifies the transformation of fingerprints into records suitable for transmission to the FBI
           for the background check.
Note that although FBI requirements drive the sensor specifications, the permanent electronic storage formats,
specified in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, are INCITS (i.e. non-FBI) standard records and are therefore specified
independently. Figure 1 depicts the procedure for fingerprint acquisition and storage.

INFORMATIVE NOTES:
    1.   There is no requirement that the order specified above is the order in which the images must be acquired.
    2.   The combined multi-finger plain-impression images are also referred to as slaps or flats. They are obtained by
         simultaneous placement of multiple fingers on the imaging surface without specific rolling movement.
    3. Options 2 and 3 represent existing agency practice. Option 1 has recently become acceptable to the FBI.
For Options 1 and 2 the devices used for capture of the fingerprints shall have been certified by the FBI to
conform to Appendix F of the FBI’s Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification [EFTS, Appendix F].
For Option 3, a scan of the inked card shall be performed to effect conversion to electronic form. The scanner
shall be certified by the FBI as being compliant with [EFTS, Appendix F]. The scanning is needed to produce
fingerprints in the digital format described in Section 3.4 and thereby Section 3.5. The FBI specifications
include width and height specifications for the imaging surface. The native scanning resolution of the device
shall be 197 pixels per centimeter (500 pixels per inch) in both the horizontal and vertical directions. These
specifications comply with the FBI submission requirements and with the Image Acquisition Setting Level 31 of
the Finger Image-Based Data Interchange Format standard, INCITS 381, [FINGSTD].
The procedure for the collection of fingerprints, presented in Table 2, shall be followed. An attending official
shall be present at the time of fingerprint capture. The official shall ensure that the applicant does not swap
finger positions or hands, occlude fingers, or misalign or misplace the fingers. The procedure shall employ the
NIST Fingerprint Image Quality [NFIQ] algorithm to initiate any needed reacquisition of the images. The
procedure requires segmentation of the multi-finger plain impressions; this operation may be assisted by the
attending official.

                 Table 2: Quality Control Procedure for Acquisition of a Full set of Fingerprint Images

  Step     Action
  1.       Attending official should inspect fingers and require absence of foreign material.
  2.       Official should ensure imaging surface of the sensor, or the card, is clean.
           Acquire fingerprints according to Option 1, 2, or 3 in Table 1. For Option 3, scan the inked card using
  3.
           [EFTS, Appendix F] certified scanner.
  4.       Segment the multi-finger plain impression images into single-finger images. Automated segmentation is

                                                                                                                                  11
Special Publication 800-76                                        Biometric Specification for Personal Identity Verification

           recommended. Attending official should inspect the boundaries of the automatic segmentation and correct,
           via suitable user interface, any failures.
           Compute NFIQ value for thumbs and index fingers. If all have NFIQ values of 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., good quality)
  5.
           then go to step 8.
  6.       Repeat steps 2-4 up to three more times.
           If after four acquisitions the index fingers and thumbs do not all have NFIQ values of 1, 2 or 3 then select
           that set, acquired in step 3 and segmented in step 4, for which the mean of the NFIQ values of the left index,
  7.       right index, left thumb, and right thumb is minimum (i.e. of best quality). If all of the index finger and thumb
           quality values are unavailable (perhaps because of injury to one or more of those fingers) then use the last set
           from step 3 of those fingers that are available, without any application of NFIQ.
  8.       Prepare and store the final records per Sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5


Ordinarily, all ten fingerprints shall be imaged in this process; however, if one or more fingers are not available
(for instance, because of amputation) then as many fingers as are available shall be imaged. When fewer than
ten fingers are collected, the FBI background transaction of Section 3.4 requires (in field AMP 2.084 of an
accompanying Type 2 record) the labeling of those fingers that are amputated or otherwise not imaged; see
[EFTS, Appendix C].

3.3     Fingerprint Template Specifications
This section specifies how the PIV mandatory biometric elements specified in [FIPS] are to be generated and
stored. This specification applies to templates stored within the PIV Card, and to [MINUSTD] templates
otherwise retained by agencies. The templates constitute the enrollment biometrics for PIV authentication and
as such are supported by a high quality image acquisition specification, and a FBI-certified compression format.
The specification of a standardized template in this section enables use of the PIV Card in a multi-vendor
product environment.

3.3.1      Source Images
Two [MINUSTD] fingerprint templates shall be stored on the PIV Card; these are hereafter referred to as PIV
Card templates. These shall be prepared from images of the primary and secondary fingers (as specified in
[FIPS]). These images shall be those obtained by segmenting the plain impressions of the full set of fingerprints
captured during PIV Registration and stored in row 8 of Table 2.

3.3.2      Minutia Record
PIV Card templates shall be conformant instances of the INCITS 378-2004 [MINUSTD] minutiae template
standard. Further, each finger's template record shall be individually wrapped in the CBEFF structure specified
in Section 6 prior to storage on the PIV Card. The PIV Card templates shall not be encrypted.
Table 3 is a profile of the generic [MINUSTD] standard. Its specifications shall apply to all minutiae templates
placed on PIV Cards. These constraints are included to promote highly accurate and interoperable personal
identity verification. This document recommends that the minutiae records should be prepared after the images
are captured and before they are compressed for storage (see Figure 1).
When a PIV Card is issued, one or more authentication attempts shall be executed per [FIPS, 5.3.1]. This shall
entail capture of new live fingerprints of both the primary and secondary fingers, and matching of those with the
PIV Card templates. This binds the cardholder to the individual whose background was checked. This
authentication may use a multi-finger fingerprint imaging device to capture single-finger images for
authentication.

NORMATIVE NOTES:
    1.       The second paragraph of [MINUSTD, 6.4.2] shall be ignored. In referring to an ASCII space it contradicts the
             "three ASCII numerals" mentioned in the first paragraph.
    2.       The length of the entire record shall fit within the container size limits specified in [800-73]. These limits apply to
             the entire CBEFF wrapped and signed entity, not just the [FINGSTD] record.
    3.       Both of the two fields ("Owner" and "Type") of the CBEFF Product Identifier of [MINUSTD, Section 6.4.4] shall
             be non-zero. The two most significant bytes shall identify the vendor, and the two least significant bytes shall
             identify the version number of that supplier's minutiae detection algorithm.
    4.       The Capture Device ID shall be reported. Its use may improve interoperability.
    5.       The quality value shall be that computed for the parent image using [NFIQ] and reported here as Q = 20*(6 -
             NFIQ).
    6.       [MINUSTD] requires that each stored minutia have a type associated with it. For PIV, the mandatory card
             templates shall contain minutiae of type ridge ending or ridge bifurcation. These types are defined in [MINUSTD,
             5.3.{2,3}]. Other types of minutiae, such as trifurcations and crossovers, shall not be included in PIV Card
             templates. However, for those minutiae where it is not possible to reliably distinguish between a ridge ending and
             a bifurcation, the category of "other" shall be assigned and encoded using bit values 00b. The angle and location
             for a minutia of type “other” should be the angle and location that would have applied to the corresponding ridge
             ending or bifurcation depending on which one the encoding algorithm determines to be the most likely for that
             particular minutiae. This is a common characteristic of "inked" impressions that exhibit ridge endings being
             converted to bifurcations and vice-versa due to over- or under-inking in the image.
    7.       All coordinates and angles for minutiae shall be recorded with respect to the original finger image. They shall not
             be recorded with respect to any image processing sub-image(s) created during the template creation process.
    8.       Determination of the minutia direction can be extracted from each skeleton bifurcation. The three legs of every
             skeleton bifurcation must be examined and the endpoint of each leg determined. Figures 2A through 2C illustrate
             the three methods used for determining the end of a leg. The ending is established according to the event that
             occurs first:
                                        • The 32nd pixel – see Figures 2A and 2B

                                                                                                                                                                      14

                     • The end of skeleton leg if greater than 10 pixels (legs shorter are not used) – see Figure 2B
                     • A 2nd bifurcation is encountered before the 32nd pixel – see Figure 2C
            The angle of the minutiae is determined by constructing three virtual rays originating at the bifurcation point and
            extending to the end of each leg. The smallest of the three angles formed by the rays is bisected to indicate the
            minutiae direction.

3.4        Fingerprint Image Format for Images Retained by Agencies
This section specifies a common data format record for the retention of the fingerprint images collected in
Section 3.2. Fingerprint images enrolled or otherwise retained by agencies shall be formatted according to the
INCITS 381-2004 finger image based interchange format standard [FINGSTD]. This set shall include ten
single-finger images. These shall be obtained by segmentation of the plain multi-finger images gathered in
accordance with Options 1, 2 or 3 of Table 1, and the single plain thumb impressions from presentations 4 & 5
of Options 2 and 3. These images shall be placed into a single [FINGSTD] record. The record may also include
the associated multi-finger plain impressions and the rolled images. This document ([800-76]) does not specify
uses for any single-finger rolled images gathered according to Options 2 or 3 of Table 1. The record shall be
wrapped in the CBEFF structure described in Section 6.
Table 4 gives a clause-by-clause profile of [FINGSTD]. The primary purpose of the Table is to give PIV
specifications for those fields of [FINGSTD] that have optional content. Rows 2-11 give normative content.
Row 11 mandates the CBEFF header. Rows 12-27 give PIV specifications for the fields of the General Record
Header of [FINGSTD, Table 2]. These are common to all images in the record. Similarly, Rows 28-39 provide
specifications for the Finger Image Header Record in Table 4 of [FINGSTD]. The penultimate column provides
PIV specific practice and parameter defaults of the standard.

NORMATIVE NOTES:
      1.       The Capture Device ID should indicate the hardware model. The CBEFF PID [FINGSTD, 7.1.4] should indicate
               the firmware or software version.
      2.       If certain fingers cannot be imaged, the value of this field shall be decremented accordingly.
      3.       The left and right four-finger images, and two-thumb, images may also be included. The value of this field shall
               be incremented accordingly.
      4.       For PIV enrollment sets, the number of images will ordinarily be thirteen (that is, the ten segmented images from
               the multi-finger plain impressions, and the three plain impressions themselves) or fourteen (if the plain thumb
               impressions were imaged separately).
      5.       Images shall either be uncompressed or compressed using an implementation of the Wavelet Scalar Quantization
               (WSQ) algorithm that has been certified by the FBI. The FBI's current requirement for a 15:1 nominal
               compression ratio shall apply.
      6.       Compression should only be applied after the records required by sections 3.3 and 3.5 have been prepared and
               transformed NFIQ values have been assigned.
      7.       The term view refers to the number of images of that particular finger. This value would exceed one if imaging
               has been repeated. Inclusion of more than one image of a finger can afford some benefit in a matching process.
               This document recommends that any additionally available images (say, from a PIV Card re-issuance procedure)
               with quality value 1 to 3 should be included in the record. In all cases the images shall be stored in order of
               capture date, with newest first.
      8.       Quality values shall be present. These shall be calculated from the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ)
               method described in [NFIQ] using the formula Q = 20*(6 - NFIQ). This scale reversal ensures that high quality
               values connote high predicted performance and consistency with the dictionary definition. The values are
               intended to be predictive of the relative performance of a minutia based fingerprint matching system. It is
               recommended that a user should be prompted to first attempt authentication using the finger with the highest
               quality, regardless of whether this is the primary or secondary finger.
      9.       The quality value shall be set to 254 (the [FINGSTD] code for undefined) if this record is not a single finger print
               (i.e., it is a multi-finger image, or a palm print) or if the NFIQ implementation fails.
      10. There is not restriction on the image size. However non-background pixels of the target finger shall be retained
          (i.e. cropping of the image data is prohibited).


3.5        Fingerprint Image Specifications for Background Checks
PIV fingerprint images transmitted to the FBI as part of the background checking process shall be formatted
according to the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard [FFSMT] and the CJIS-RS-0010 [EFTS] specification. Such
records shall be prepared from, and contain, only those images collected as per specifications in Section 3.1.
Table 5 enumerates the appropriate transaction formats for the three acquisition options of Section 3.2. The FBI
documentation [EFTS] should be consulted for definitive requirements.

NORMATIVE NOTES:
      1.       All types of transactions with the FBI require both a Type 1 and Type 2 record to accompany the data; see
               [FFSMT, Table 2]. The Type 2 supports labeling of missing fingers.
      2.       The forthcoming ANSI/NIST-ITL revision (due in late 2006) will not alter the Appendix N specification. In any
               case Appendix N shall be the definitive reference.


4.         Sensor Specifications for Fingerprint Verification


4.1        Scope
This section gives specifications for all fingerprint sensors used for capture of live authentication fingerprints
(i.e. for the verification of PIV cardholders). These specifications are unrelated to those of section 3 which
govern enrollment.

4.2        PIV Authentication Fingerprint Acquisition Specifications
Fingerprint sensors used for PIV authentication shall conform to [EFTS, Appendix G]. Additionally devices
shall be capable of imaging an area of at least 12.8 millimeters horizontally x 16.5 millimeters vertically at a
native resolution of at least 197 pixels per centimeter in each direction.


5.         Facial Image Specifications


5.1        Scope
[FIPS, Section 4.4.1] requires collection of a facial image from PIV applicants, and indicates that it may be used
for generation of the printed image [FIPS, Section 4.1.4.1] and for augmentation of human authentication of the
card holder. The face specification in this document supports those activities, and establishes a storage format
for retention of facial images. As with other biometric elements, agencies may elect to store face data on the
PIV card and use it for automated verification. Although this section places no normative requirements on such
agency-optional activities, it does specify an image suited for automated biometric enrollment and face
recognition.

5.2        Acquisition and Format
This section provides specifications for the retention of facial images. Facial images collected during PIV
Registration shall be formatted such that they conform to INCITS 385-2004 [FACESTD]. In addition to
establishing a format, [FACESTD] specifies how a face image should be acquired. This is done to improve
image quality and, ultimately, performance. The images shall be embedded within the CBEFF structure defined
in Section 6. Because [FACESTD] is generic across applications it includes sections that have either-or
requirements. Table 6 is an application profile of [FACESTD] tailored for PIV. It gives concrete specifications
for much of the generic content. Column 3 references the sections of [FACESTD] and columns 4 and 5 give
[FACESTD] requirements. For PIV, column 6 of Table 6 gives normative practice or value specifications. The
table is not conformant with the Implementation Conformance Statement [ICS] standard. Particularly it extends
the function of ICS but because it has the needed rows it may be useful in construction of a traditional ICS.



                                                                                                                              18

Nevertheless the addition of a "values supported column" as specified in Section 9.1 of [ICS] should be used by
implementers for checking conformance to the specifications.

NORMATIVE NOTES:
     1.       If facial imagery is stored on the PIV Card, the length of the entire record shall fit within the container size limits
              specified in [800-73]. These limits apply to the entire CBEFF wrapped and signed entity, not just the [FACESTD]
              record. Key lengths and signing algorithms are specified in [800-78]. The size of the digital signature scales with
              the key length; it does not scale with the size of the biometric record.
     2.       More than one image may be stored in the record. It may be appropriate to store several images if appearance
              changes over time (beard, no beard, beard) and images are gathered at re-issuance. The most recent image shall
              appear first and serve as the default provided to applications.
     3.       When facial imagery is stored on the PIV Card, only one image shall be stored.
     4.       PIV facial images shall conform to the Full Frontal Image Type defined in Section 8 of [FACESTD].
     5.       Facial image data shall be formatted in either of the compression formats enumerated in Section 6.2 of
              [FACESTD]. Both whole-image and single-region-of-interest (ROI) compression are permitted. This document
              ([800-76]) recommends that newly collected facial image should be compressed using ISO/IEC 15444 (i.e. JPEG
              2000). This applies when images will be input to automated face recognition products for authentication, and
              when images are stored on PIV Cards. In this latter case, ROI compression should be used. The older ISO/IEC
              10918 standard (i.e. JPEG) should be used only for legacy images.
     6.       Facial images shall be compressed using a compression ratio no higher than 15:1. However, when facial images
              are stored on PIV Cards JPEG 2000 should be used with ROI compression. The innermost region should be
              centered on the face and compressed at no more than 24:1.
     7.       Face recognition performance is a function of the spatial resolution of the image. [FACESTD] does not specify a
              minimum resolution for the Full Frontal Image Type. For PIV, faces shall be acquired such that a 20 centimeter
              target placed on, and normal to, a camera's optical axis at a range of 1.5 meters shall be imaged with at least 240
              pixels across it. This ensures that the width of the head (i.e. dimension CC in Figure 8 of [FACESTD]) shall have
              sufficient resolution for the printed face element of the PIV Card. This specification and Section 8.3.4 of
              [FACESTD] implies that the image width shall exceed 420 pixels. This resolution specification shall be attained
              optically without digital interpolation. The distance from the camera to the subject should be greater than or equal
              to 1.5 meters (for distortion reasons discussed in [FACESTD, Annex A.8]). The size specification is a minimum:
              When images are to be used for automated face recognition higher resolution is likely to yield lower error rates.
     8.       Facial image data shall be converted to the sRGB color space if stored. As stated in Section 7.4.3.3 of
              [FACESTD] this requires application of the color profile associated with the camera in use.


6.        Common Header for PIV Biometric Data

All PIV biometric data shall be embedded in a data structure conforming to Common Biometric Exchange
Formats Framework [CBEFF]. This specifies that all biometric data shall be digitally signed and uniformly
encapsulated. This covers: the PIV Card fingerprints mandated by [FIPS]; any other biometric data agencies
elect to place on PIV Cards; any biometric records that agencies elect to retain (including purely proprietary, or
derivative, elements); and any biometric data retained by, or for, agencies or Registration Authorities. The
EFTS transaction data described in section 3.5 is exempt.




                                                                                                                                                     21

All such data shall be signed in the same manner as prescribed in [FIPS 201] and [800-73] for the mandatory
biometric elements. The signature is present for integrity and shall be stored in the CBEFF signature block.
The overall arrangement is depicted in Table 7.

The CBEFF Header specified in Table 8 and its notes will be established by NIST as Patron Format "PIV". This
format will be established as a formal Patron Format per the provisions of [CBEFF, clause 6.2]. It adds
definitive data types and the FASC-N field mandated by [FIPS] to a subset of the fields given in Patron Format
A [CBEFF, Annex A]. It exists independently of Patron Format A. All fields of the format are mandatory.

       2.    The security options field has two acceptable values. The value b00001101 indicates that the biometric data block
             is digitally signed but not encrypted; the value b00001111 indicates the biometric data block is digitally signed and
             encrypted. For the mandatory [MINUSTD] elements on the PIV Card the value shall be b00001101.
             The fourth bit (mask 0x08) is set per prior versions of this document. The third bit (mask 0x04), which in each
             case is set, implements the [CBEFF, 5.2.1.2] requirement that digital signature is differentiated from message
             authentication code. The second bit (mask 0x02) indicates the use of encryption. The first bit (mask 0x01)

    3.   For fingerprint and facial records defined above the Format Owner shall be 0x001B denoting M1, the INCITS
         Technical Committee on Biometrics. Otherwise see [CBEFF, 5.2.1.17].
    4.   For fingerprint image data defined above the Format Type shall be 0x0401. For the mandatory fingerprint
         minutiae template data this value shall be 0x0201. For face data this value shall be 0x0501. For other biometric
         records on the PIV Card or otherwise retained by agencies this field shall be assigned in accordance with the
         procedures of [CBEFF, 5.2.1.17].
    5.   This is the date that the biometric sample was acquired. For processed samples (e.g. templates) this data should be
         the date of acquisition of the parent sample. Creation Date shall be encoded in eight bytes using a binary
         representation of "YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ". Each pair of characters (for example, "DD") is coded in 8 bits as an
         unsigned integer. Thus 17:35:30 December 15, 2005 is represented as: 00010100 00000101 00001100 00001111
         00010001 00100011 00011110 01011010 where the last byte is the binary representation of the ASCII character Z
         which is included to indicate that the time is represented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The field "hh"
         shall code a 24 hour clock value.
    6.   The Validity Period contains two dates each of which shall be coded according to Normative Note 5.
    7.   For fingerprint images and any kind of fingerprint template the type shall be 0x000008, for facial images the type
         shall be 0x000002. The value for other biometric modalities shall be that given in [CBEFF, 5.2.1.5]. For
         modalities not listed there the value shall be 0x0.
    8.   [CBEFF, 5.2.1.7] establishes three categories for the degree to which biometric data has been processed. These
         are encoded in Table 9. For the mandatory [MINUSTD] PIV Card templates this value shall be b100xxxxx.

    9.   For single [FINGSTD] fingerprint images or [MINUSTD] templates extracted from them, the quality value shall
         be Q = 20*(6 - NFIQ) where NFIQ is computed using the method of [NFIQ]. When multiple views or samples of
         a biometric are contained in the record the largest (i.e. best) value should be reported. For all biometric data
         whether stored on a PIV Card or otherwise retained by agencies the quality value shall be a signed integer between
         -2 and 100 per the text of INCITS 358. A value of -2 shall denote that assignment was not supported by the
         implementation; a value of -1 shall indicate that an attempt to compute a quality value failed. Values from 0 to
         100 shall indicate an increased expectation that the sample will ultimately lead to a successful match. The zero
         value required by [FACESTD] shall be coded in this CBEFF field as -2.
    10. For PIV the Creator field has length 18 bytes of which the first K ≤ 17 bytes shall be ASCII characters, and the
        first of the remaining 18-K shall be a null terminator (zero).
    11. This field shall contain the 25 bytes of the FASC-N component of the CHUID identifier, per [800-73, 1.8.{3,4}].

7.         Performance Testing and Certification Procedures


7.1        PIV Authentication
This section specifies certification procedures for implementations that generate and/or match the mandatory
biometric elements specified by [FIPS], i.e. the two fingerprint minutiae templates placed on the PIV Card.
These templates conform to [MINUSTD] as profiled in section 3.3. The use cases given in [800-73, Appendix
C] detail how the templates and the PIV Card are used for interoperable authentication. Authentication may
involve one or both of the PIV Card templates. These will be compared with newly acquired (i.e. live)
fingerprint images of either or both of the primary and secondary fingers. The inclusion of the finger position in
the [MINUSTD] header allows a user to be prompted for their specific finger or fingers.
Authentication performance is quantified in terms of both the false reject rate (FRR) and the false accept rate
(FAR). In PIV, the former would quantify the proportion of legitimate cardholders incorrectly denied access;
the latter would be the proportion of impostors incorrectly allowed access. The error rates depend on a number
of factors including: the environment, the number of attempts (i.e. finger placements on the sensor), the sensor
itself, the quality of the PIV Card templates' parent images, the number of fingerprints invoked, and the
familiarity of users with the process. The use of two fingers2 in all authentication transactions offers
substantially improved performance over single-finger authentication. The intent of the [FIPS] specification of
an interoperable biometric is to support cross-vendor and cross-agency authentication of PIV Cards. This plural
aspect introduces a source of variation in performance.
The remainder of section 7 refers to authentication trials for testing purposes, and should not be confused with
specifications on the format or use of biometric data in fielded PIV authentication implementations.

7.2        Test Overview
This section specifies procedures for the certification of generators and matchers of [MINUSTD] templates.
Interoperability testing requires exchange of templates between products, which shall therefore be tested as a
group. Accordingly the test organization shall conduct a first round of testing to establish a primary group of
interoperable template generators and matchers. Certification shall be determined quantitatively at the
conclusion of the test.
The certification procedure shall be conducted offline. This allows products to be certified using very large
biometric data sets, in repeatable, deterministic and therefore auditable evaluations. Offline evaluation is
needed to measure performance when template data is exchanged between all pairs of interoperable products.
Large populations shall be used to quantify the effect of sample variance on performance. A template generator
is logically a converter of images to templates. A template matcher logically compares one or two images with
one or two templates to produce a similarity score. Template generators and template matchers shall be certified
separately. This aspect is instituted because:
       1. Template generation is procedurally, algorithmically and physically distinct from matching.
       2. Template generation is required by [FIPS], but matching is not.
       3. Fingerprint template interoperability is dependent on the quality of the PIV Card templates. The full
          benefits of an interoperable template will not be realized if a supplier is required to produce both a high
          performing generator and a high performing matcher.

    The International Labor Organization's seminal evaluation of interoperable fingerprint templates used "up to three match attempts for each of the primary
       and secondary finger" for authentication trials. See http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/sector/papers/maritime/sid-test-report2.pdf


                                                                                                                                                         24

    4. Once a template generator is certified and deployed, its templates will be in circulation. It is necessary
       for all matchers to be able to process these templates. Subsequent certification rounds will be
       complicated if generators and matchers are certified together.
Separate certification means that a supplier may submit zero or more template generators and zero or more
matchers for certification. Zero or more of the submitted products shall ultimately be certified.
This test design conforms to the provisions of the currently draft ISO/IEC 19795-4 [ISOSWAP] standard, as
profiled by this document. One requirement of that standard is that testing shall be blind: This means that a
template matcher shall not be able to discern the source of the enrollment templates.

7.2.1        Template Generator
A template matcher shall be certified as a software library. For PIV a template generator is a library function
that shall convert an image into minutiae record. The input image represents a PIV enrollment plain impression.
The output template represents a PIV Card template. A supplier's implementation, submitted for certification,
shall satisfy the requirements of an API specification to be published by the test organizer. The API
specification will support at a minimum the logical operations of Table 10. The template generator shall parse
this record and produce [MINUSTD] templates conformant to Table 12. Where values or practices are not
explicitly stated in Table 12, the specifications of section 3.3.2 and Table 3 apply (e.g. on minutiae type). The
CBEFF header and CBEFF signature shall not be included.

                Table 10: Specification for Application Programming Interface for Template Generators


Function      Input Data           Output Data   Description

Template      Fingerprint image    Standard      Converts input images conforming to the [FINGSTD] specification of Table 11
generation                         Template      into the [MINUSTD] enrollment templates of Table 12. Template generators
                                                 shall produce a conformant template regardless of the input. Such a template
                                                 may contain zero minutiae. This provision transparently and correctly accounts
                                                 for failures to enroll.
                                                 In a deployed system, if some quality assessment or image analysis algorithms
                                                 made some determination that the input was unmatchable a failure to enroll
                                                 might be declared. In an offline test such a determination shall result in at least
                                                 a template containing zero minutiae. However because in PIV other suppliers'
                                                 matchers may be capable of handling even poor templates it is recommended
                                                 that a template generator submitted for testing should deprecate any internal
                                                 quality acceptance mechanism, and attempt production of a viable template.
                                                 The input [FINGSTD] record shall be prepared by the test agent.

7.3   Test Procedure
The test organization shall publish a test specification document. This document shall establish deadlines for
submission of products for certification.
The supplier of a template generator shall submit a request for certification to the test organization. The test
organization shall provide a set of samples to these suppliers. This set shall support debugging and shall consist
of images conformant to the specification of Table 11. The supplier shall submit templates from this data to the
test organization. The supplier shall submit the template generator to the test organization. The test
organization shall execute it and check that it produces identical templates to those submitted by the supplier.
The test organization shall apply a conformance assessor to the templates. The test organization shall report to
the supplier whether identical templates were produced and whether the templates are conformant to the
specifications in Table 12. This validation process may be iterative.
The supplier of a template matcher shall submit a request for certification to the test organization. The test
organization shall provide a set of samples to these suppliers. This set shall support debugging and shall consist
of images conformant to the specification of Table 11 and templates conformant to the specification of Table 12.
The supplier shall submit similarity scores from this data to the test organization. The supplier shall submit the
template matcher to the test organization. The test organization shall execute it and check that it produces
identical scores to those submitted by the supplier. The test organization shall report to the supplier the result of
the check. This validation process may be iterative.
The test organization shall apply all template generators to the first biometric sample from each member of the
test corpus. The test organization shall invoke all template matchers to compare the resulting enrollment
templates with second samples from each member of the corpus. This shall be done for all pair wise
combinations of template generators and template matchers. The result is a set of genuine scores for each
combination.
The test organization shall invoke all template matchers to compare enrollment templates with biometric
samples from members of a disjoint population. This shall be done for all pair wise combinations of template
generators and template matchers. The result is a set of impostor scores for each combination. The order in
which genuine and impostor scores are generated shall be randomized, and is not implied by the order of the last
two paragraphs.
The test organization shall compute the detection error tradeoff characteristic (DET) for all pair wise
combinations of the template generators and template matchers. The test organization shall generate a

                                                                                                                               28

rectangular interoperability matrix (see [ISOSWAP]). The matrix has rows corresponding to the generators and
columns corresponding to the matchers. The elements of the interoperability matrix shall be figures of merit.
The figure of merit shall be the false reject rate at a specific false acceptance rate. This value corresponds to one
operating point on the DET. As described in Table 10 and Table 13, the DETs automatically include the effect
of failure to enroll and acquire.

7.4       Certification Criteria
A template generator shall be certified on the basis of the conformance of its output, its speed of computation,
and on the error rates observed when its templates are used in one-to-one verification trials. A template
generator shall be certified if:
       1. it converts all input Table 11 [FINGSTD] instances to Table 12 [MINUSTD] templates and these pass
          the template conformance test suite established by NIST; and
       2. it converts 90% of Table 11 [FINGSTD] instances in fewer than 1.3 seconds3; and
       3. it is part of the interoperable group determined according to section 7.4.1.
A template matcher shall be certified on the basis of its speed of computation and on the error rates observed
when it matches templates. A template matcher shall be certified if:
       1. it converts all input Table 12 [MINUSTD] templates to scalar scores; and
       2. it executes 90% of the Table 13 (row 2) template matches in fewer than 0.1 seconds; and
       3. it is part of the interoperable group determined according to section 7.4.1.

7.4.1          Interoperable Group
A template generator and a template matcher shall be certified if it belongs to the interoperable group of
template generators and matchers. The interoperable group is the largest subgroup of those submitted in the
certification round for which all elements of its interoperability sub-matrix (i.e. FRR values) are less than or
equal to 1% at a fixed 1% FAR operating point. This specification does not preclude an agency from using
more stringent false acceptance rate criteria. The condition that all pair wise product combinations should be
below threshold is instituted the PIV application is intolerant of isolated non-interoperable pairs.


8.        Conformance to This Specification


8.1       Conformance
Conformance to this specification will be achieved if an implementation and its associated data records conform
to the normative ("shall") sections of sections 3 through 6. The following text summarizes these statements.

8.2       Conformance to PIV Registration Fingerprint Acquisition Specifications
Conformance to Section 3.2 requires the use of an [EFTS, Appendix F] certified scanner to collect a full set of
fingerprint images and the application of a segmentation algorithm and the [NFIQ]-based quality assurance
procedure. Images shall be conformant to this specification if:
        1. The acquisition procedures of 3.2 are followed. This may be tested by human observation.
        2. The images are conformant to [FINGSTD] as profiled by Table 4 and its normative notes.

3
    This specification applies to a commercial-off-the-shelf PC procured in 2005 and equipped with a 2GHz processor and 512 MB of main memory. This
        specification shall be adjusted by the testing organization to reflect significant changes of the computational platform.


                                                                                                                                                 29

      3. Testing of images to the requirements of [EFTS, Appendix F].

8.3    Conformance of PIV Card Fingerprint Template Records
Conformance to Section 3.3 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the section. This
includes production of records conformant to [MINUSTD] as profiled in Section 3.3. Conformance shall be
tested by inspection of the records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of
Table 3. Performance certification according to Section 7 is necessary.

8.4    Conformance of PIV Registration Fingerprints Retained by Agencies
Conformance to Section 3.4 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the section. This
includes production of records conformant to [FINGSTD] as profiled in Section 3.4. Conformance shall be
tested by inspection of the records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of
Table 4. Quality values [NFIQ] shall be checked against the NIST reference implementation.

8.5    Conformance of PIV Background Check Records
Conformance to Section 3.5 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the section. This
necessitates conformance to the normative requirements of the FBI for background checks. These shall be
tested by inspection of the transactions submitted to the FBI. This inspection may be performed either by
capturing the transactions at the submitting agency or at the FBI.

8.6    Conformance to PIV Authentication Fingerprint Acquisition Specifications
Conformance to Section 4.2 shall be achieved if certification according to [EFTS, Appendix G] is achieved, and
if the resolution and area specifications are met. The Appendix G certification process entails inspection of
output images.

8.7    Conformance of PIV Facial image Records
Conformance to Section 5 shall be achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the section. This
includes production of records conformant to [FACESTD] as profiled in Section 5.2. Conformance shall be
tested by inspection of records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of Table 6.

8.8    Conformance of CBEFF Wrappers
A PIV implementation will be conformant to section 6 if all biometric data records, whether or not mandated by
this document or [FIPS], are encapsulated in conformant CBEFF records. CBEFF records are conformant if:
      1. the fields of the Table 8 header are present;
      2. the fields of Table 8 contain the allowed values as governed by its normative notes;
      3. a digital signature conformant to [800-78] is present;
      4. the values are consistent with the enclosed biometric data and the trailing digital signature.
An application that tests conformance of PIV biometric data shall be provided with appropriate keys to decrypt
and check the digital signature.
