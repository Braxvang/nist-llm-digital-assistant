Executive Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), with sponsorship from the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), has produced Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products:
Guidance for Checklist Users and Developers to facilitate the development and dissemination of security
configuration checklists so that organizations and individual users can better secure their IT products.

A security configuration checklist (sometimes called a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is in
its simplest form a series of instructions for configuring a product to a particular operational environment.
It could also include templates or automated scripts and other procedures. Typically, checklists are
created by IT vendors for their own products; however, checklists are also created by other organizations
such as consortia, academia, and government agencies. The use of well-written, standardized checklists
can markedly reduce the vulnerability exposure of IT products. Checklists may be particularly helpful to
small organizations and individuals that have limited resources for securing their systems.

This publication is intended for users and developers of IT product security configuration checklists. For
checklist users, this document gives an overview of the NIST Checklist Program, explains how to retrieve
checklists from NIST’s repository, and provides general information about threat discussions and baseline
technical security practices for associated operational environments. For checklist developers, the
document sets forth the policies, procedures, and general requirements for participation in the NIST
Checklist Program.

The Cyber Security Research and Development Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-305) tasks NIST to
“develop, and revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and option selections that minimize
the security risks associated with each computer hardware or software system that is, or is likely to
become widely used within the Federal Government.” In addition, the Common Configuration Working
Group Report of the Technical Standards and Common Criteria Task Force,1 formed at the Department of
Homeland Security's first National Cyber Security Summit in 2003, recommended government promotion
of the use of a NIST central repository for IT security configuration checklists. In response, this
document has been developed by NIST in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Cyber
Security Act as well as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 (Public Law
107-347).2

WHY USE SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS?

There are many threats to users’ computers, ranging from remotely launched network service exploits to
malicious code spread through e-mails, malicious web sites, and file downloads. Vulnerabilities in IT
products are discovered on an almost daily basis, and many ready-to-use exploits are widely available on
the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security
controls are usually not enabled by default, so many IT products are immediately vulnerable out-of-the-
box. It is a complicated, arduous, and time-consuming task for even experienced system administrators to
identify a reasonable set of security settings for many IT products.

While the solutions to IT security are complex, one basic yet effective tool is the security configuration
checklist. To facilitate the development of security configuration checklists and to meet the requirements
of the Cyber Security Act, NIST has developed a program to (a) provide vendors and other groups with

guidance for developing standardized, high-quality checklists to secure IT products, (b) establish a formal
framework for the submission of checklists to NIST, and (c) assist users by making available a checklist
repository.

Some of the benefits that organizations and individuals can achieve by using checklists are as follows:

        Providing a baseline level of security to protect against common and dangerous local and remote
         threats and a consistent approach to securing systems
        Significantly reducing the time required to research and develop appropriate security
         configurations for installed IT products
        Allowing smaller organizations to leverage outside resources to implement recommended
         practice security configurations
        Preventing public loss of confidence or embarrassment due to compromise of publicly accessible
         systems.

While the use of security configuration checklists can greatly improve overall levels of security in
organizations, no checklist can permit a system or a product to become 100 % secure. However, use of
checklists that emphasize hardening of systems against flaws or bugs inherent in software will typically
result in greater levels of product security and protection from future threats.

WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE NIST PROGRAM?

Many organizations have created various checklists; however, these checklists may vary widely in terms
of quality and usability, and may have become outdated as software updates and upgrades have been
released. Because there is no central checklist repository, finding security checklists can be a difficult
task. Additionally, one checklist may differ significantly from another in terms of the level of security
provided. It may be difficult to determine if the checklist is current, or how the checklist should be
implemented. While many existing checklists are of high quality and usable, the majority of checklists
are not accessible or beneficial for most audiences.

The goals of the NIST program are:

        To facilitate the development and sharing of security configuration checklists by providing a
         framework for developers to submit checklists to NIST
        To assist developers in making checklists that conform to common operational environments
        To assist developers and users by providing guidelines for making checklists better documented
         and more usable
        To provide a managed process for the review, update, and maintenance of checklists
        To provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists.

NIST’s program also serves to assist vendors in the process of making their checklists available to users
out-of-the-box. In such cases, it will still be advisable for product users to consult the NIST checklist
repository for updates to pre-installed checklists.

HOW DO USERS ACCESS THE CHECKLISTS?

NIST maintains a checklist repository containing the descriptions of the checklists, located at
http://checklists.nist.gov/. Users can browse the descriptions to locate a particular checklist using a
variety of different criteria, including the product category, vendor name, and submitting organization.
This document contains procedures for checklist users to follow when retrieving checklists and applying
them to IT products.

WHAT ARE THE COMMON OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS?

NIST recognizes that checklists are significantly more useful when they follow common operational
environments. The NIST Checklist Program identifies several broad and specialized operational
environments, any one of which should be common to most audiences. By identifying and describing
these environments, users can better select the checklists that are most appropriate for their operating
environments, and developers can better target their checklists to the general security baselines associated
with the environments. The operational environments are:

       Standalone or Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) describes small, informal computer
        installations that are used for home or business purposes. Standalone encompasses a variety of
        small-scale environments and devices, ranging from laptops, mobile devices, or home computers,
        to telecommuting systems, to small businesses and small branch offices of a company.
       Managed or Enterprise are typically large organizational systems with defined, organized suites
        of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of centrally-managed workstations
        and servers protected from the Internet by firewalls and other network security devices.
       Custom environments contain systems in which the functionality and degree of security do not fit
        the other environments. Two typical Custom environments are Specialized Security-Limited
        Functionality and Legacy:
            o   Specialized Security-Limited Functionality. A Specialized Security-Limited
                Functionality environment contains systems and networks at high risk of attack or data
                exposure, with security taking precedence over functionality. It assumes systems have
                limited or specialized (not general purpose workstations or systems) functionality in a
                highly threatened environment such as an outward facing firewall or public web server or
                whose data content or mission purpose is of such value that aggressive trade-offs in favor
                of security outweigh the potential negative consequences to other useful system attributes
                such as legacy applications or interoperability with other systems. Checklists for this
                environment are not recommended for home users or for large scale general purpose
                systems. A Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment could be a subset of
                another environment.
            o   Legacy. A Legacy environment contains older systems or applications that may use
                older, less-secure communication mechanisms. Other machines operating in a Legacy
                environment may need less restrictive security settings so that they can communicate
                with legacy systems and applications. A Legacy environment could be a subset of a
                Standalone or Managed environment.

HOW DO CHECKLIST DEVELOPERS USE THE PROGRAM?

The NIST Checklist Program provides a process and guidance for developing checklists in a consistent
fashion. For checklist developers, steps include the initial development of the checklist, checklist testing,
documenting the checklist according to the guidelines of the program, and submitting a checklist package

to NIST. NIST then screens the checklist according to program requirements prior to a public review of
the checklist, which typically lasts 30 to 60 days. After the public review period and any subsequent
issue resolution, it will be listed on the NIST checklist repository (http://checklists.nist.gov/) with a
detailed description. NIST will periodically ask checklist developers to review their checklists and
provide updates as necessary. NIST will retire or archive checklists as they become outdated or incorrect.

WHERE DO FISMA REQUIREMENTS FIT IN?

FISMA (section 3544(b)(2)(D)(iii)) [3] requires each agency to determine minimally acceptable system
configuration requirements and ensure compliance with them. Accordingly, Federal agencies, as well as
vendors of products for the Federal government, are encouraged to acquire or implement and share such
checklists using the NIST repository.

1.       Introduction

A security configuration checklist (sometimes called a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is in
its simplest form a series of documented instructions for configuring a product to a pre-defined
operational environment. It could also include templates or automated scripts and other procedures.
Checklists can be developed for specific IT products and environments not only by IT vendors, but also
by consortia, industry, Federal agencies and other governmental organizations, and others in the public
and private sectors. The use of well-written, standardized checklists can reduce the vulnerability
exposure of IT products and be particularly helpful to small organizations and individuals for securing
their systems.

This publication is intended for users and developers of IT product security configuration checklists. For
checklist users, this document describes security configuration checklists and their benefits, and explains
how to use the NIST Checklist Program to find and retrieve checklists. For developers, the document and
its appendices describe the policies, procedures, and general requirements for participation in the NIST
Checklist Program.

It has become more important than ever to maintain secure networks and hosts. Widespread electronic
attacks on all computer systems have become commonplace. There are many threats to users’ computers,
ranging from remotely launched network service exploits to malicious code spread through e-mails,
malicious web sites, and file downloads. Vulnerabilities in IT products (e.g., operating systems,
applications) are discovered on an almost daily basis, and many ready-to-use exploits are widely available
on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive
security controls are usually not enabled by default, so many IT products are immediately vulnerable in
their out-of-the-box configuration.

Complicating this situation is that today’s systems and products can be very complex to administer and
difficult to secure. For example, personal computer systems of today are far more complicated and
sophisticated than yesterday’s systems, and many if not most users and administrators cannot be expected
to manage them securely without assistance. It is a complicated, arduous, and time-consuming task for
even experienced system administrators to know what a reasonable set of security settings is for many
different IT products. However, security is very important to all audiences, from individual home users to
large enterprise end-users, because all systems face threats. In some cases, home and telecommuter user
systems may benefit from the same strong security controls usually found in larger organizations because
they face common threats via use of the Internet.

While the solutions to IT security are complex, one simple yet effective tool is the security configuration
checklist. To facilitate the development of security configuration checklists and to meet the requirements
of the Cyber Security Research and Development Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-305) [1], NIST has
developed a program with the following goals:

         To assist vendors and other groups with guidance for developing standardized, high-quality
          checklists
         To provide a formal program for the submission of the checklists to NIST
         To assist checklist users by making available a checklist repository.
For current or potential checklist users, this document provides an overview of the NIST checklist
program and how to retrieve and use checklists. This publication describes the NIST checklist repository,
located at http://checklists.nist.gov/. Users of the repository can check the availability of checklists for IT




                                                      1-1

products they are using or considering for purchase, identify the differences between checklists developed
for identical IT products, and find the locations where the checklists can be obtained.

For developers of checklists, this document provides an overview of using the program to build checklists
and submit them to NIST. It describes how NIST will screen checklist submissions, how checklists will
be listed and maintained, how issues will be addressed, and what the administrative requirements are for
participation in the program and for use of the NIST Checklist logo.

1.1        Authority

The Cyber Security Act tasks NIST to “develop, and revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings
and option selections that minimize the security risks associated with each computer hardware or software
system that is, or is likely to become widely used within the Federal Government.” In response, this
document has been developed by NIST in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Cyber
Security Act as well as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law
107-347 [3].

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III [4].

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired. Nothing
in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on
Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these guidelines be
interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of
the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2        Audience and Assumptions

This document has been created for current and potential checklist users and developers in both the public
and private sectors. Checklist developers include IT vendors, consortia, industry, government
organizations, and others in the public and private sectors. Checklist users include end-users, system
administrators, and IT managers within government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and other
organizations, as well as private citizens.

Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with general computer security concepts and with
using Web-based methods for retrieving information.

2.        The NIST Security Configuration Checklists Program

This section contains an overview of the NIST Checklist Program. It begins by describing the contents of
checklists and giving examples of the types of IT products for which checklists are often created. Next,
the section explains the benefits that security configuration checklists can provide, such as improving
baseline levels of security for an organization. It also explains the goals and benefits of the NIST
Checklist Program, including increasing the quality, usability, and availability of checklists. This section
also provides an overview of the procedures for checklist users and developers and the types of
operational environments, as well as a summary of FISMA-related guidance pertaining to use of
configuration checklists. Subsequent sections of the guide provide additional information on procedures
and environment definitions.

2.1          What is a Security Configuration Checklist?

A security configuration checklist (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security
guide, security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark)3 is essentially a document that
contains instructions or procedures for configuring an IT product to an operational environment.
Checklists can be developed not only by IT vendors, but also by consortia, academia, and industry,
Federal agencies and other governmental organizations, and others in the public and private sectors. A
checklist might include any of the following:

          Configuration files that automatically set various security settings (e.g., executables, security
           templates that modify settings, scripts)
          Documentation (e.g., text file) that guides the checklist user to manually configure an IT product
          Documents that explain the recommended methods to securely install and configure a device
          Policy documents that set forth guidelines for such things as auditing, authentication mechanisms
           (e.g., passwords), and perimeter security.
Not all instructions in a security configuration checklist need to be for security settings. Checklists can
also include administrative practices for an IT product that go hand-in-hand with improvements to the
product’s security. Often, successful attacks on systems are the direct result of poor administrative
practices such as not changing default passwords or failure to apply old patches.

Typically, a system administrator or end-user follows the instructions in the checklist to configure a
product or system to the baseline level of security implemented in the checklist. The system
administrator may need to modify the checklist to incorporate the local security policy.

Some examples of the types of devices and software for which security checklists are intended are as
follows:

          General purpose operating systems
          Common desktop applications such as e-mail clients, Web browsers, word processors, personal
           firewalls, and antivirus software
          Infrastructure devices such as routers, firewalls, virtual private network (VPN) gateways,
           intrusion detection systems (IDS), wireless access points (WAP), and telecom systems


3
      From herein, the Cyber Security Act terminology, checklist, will be used to describe a security configuration checklist or
      what other literature may refer to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, or benchmark configuration.


                                                                2-1
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




         Application servers such as Domain Name System (DNS) servers, Dynamic Host Configuration
          Protocol (DHCP) servers, Web servers, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers, File
          Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and database servers
         Other network devices such as mobile devices, scanners, printers, copiers, and fax appliances.

2.2        What Are the Benefits to Using Security Checklists?

Security configuration checklists, when developed correctly, can greatly assist users in configuring IT
products to security baselines that offer more protection than the installed out-of-the-box defaults. The
following list includes some of the benefits associated with using checklists:

         Providing a baseline level of security to protect against common and dangerous local and remote
          threats (e.g., viruses and worms, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, inappropriate
          usage)
         Significantly reducing the time required to research and develop appropriate security
          configurations for installed IT products by leveraging existing checklists with in-house expertise
         Allowing smaller organizations to leverage outside resources to implement recommended
          practice security configurations
         Preventing public loss of confidence or embarrassment due to compromise of publicly accessible
          systems.
While the use of security configuration checklists can significantly improve overall levels of security in
organizations, no checklist can permit a system or a product to become 100 % secure. However, use of
checklists that emphasize hardening of systems against the hidden flaws or bugs inherent in software will
typically result in greater levels of product security and protection from future threats (e.g., zero day
vulnerabilities). IT vendors that provide recommended checklists "out of the box" that adhere with the
FISMA-associated security control baselines will not only provide more consistency in configuration
settings within the federal agencies but also provide a much more cost-effective method of establishing
the minimum configurations settings even if the agencies must modify the original checklists provided by
checklist developers to fine tune the configuration settings for their particular applications and operational
environments.

2.3        The NIST Checklist Program

Many organizations have created various checklists; however, these checklists may vary widely in terms
of quality and usability, and may have become outdated as software updates and upgrades have been
released. Because there is no central checklist repository, finding security checklists can be a difficult
task. Additionally, one checklist may differ significantly from another in terms of the level of security
provided. It may be difficult to determine if the checklist is current, or how the checklist should be
implemented. While many existing checklists are of high quality and usable, the majority of checklists
are not accessible or beneficial for most audiences.

NIST’s program serves to make checklists more organized and usable. The goals of the NIST program
are as follows:

         To facilitate the development and sharing of checklists by providing a framework for developers
          to submit checklists to NIST




                                                           2-2
                                                          SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




        To assist developers by providing a consistent approach to securing different types of systems
         that are connected to the same environments (i.e., a network consisting of Microsoft Windows®-
         based, UNIX-based, and Linux-based systems that need to be at the same security levels)
        To assist developers and users by providing guidelines for making checklists better documented
         and more usable
        To provide a managed process for the review, update, and maintenance of checklists
        To provide an easy-to-use national repository of checklists.

2.3.1      Types of Checklists Listed by the NIST Checklist Program

The NIST Checklist Program deals with checklists that are tied to specific IT products, such as a checklist
for a specific brand and model of a router. Some checklists may point to other checklists. For example, a
checklist for a database product may reference the checklist for the operating system on which the
database product runs.

The NIST Checklist Program can assist civilian Federal government agencies in meeting FISMA
requirements, which is discussed more in Section 2.4. Additionally, the program can list checklists for a
large variety of specialized needs,4 such as checklists related to compliance with regulatory requirements
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 [5], or the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 [6].

The NIST checklist repository is located at http://checklists.nist.gov/. The repository contains checklists
that have been developed and screened to meet the requirements of the program. Users can browse
checklist descriptions to locate and retrieve a particular checklist using a variety of different fields,
including the product category, vendor name, and submitting organization.

2.3.2      Procedures for Users and Developers

The general steps involved for checklist users and developers are shown in Figure 2-1 and
Figure 2-2. For checklist users, the steps are simple and straightforward:

        In step one, users gather their local requirements (e.g., IT products, the operating environment
         and associated security needs) and then acquire or purchase the IT product that best suits their
         needs.
        In step two, users browse the checklist repository to retrieve checklists that match the user’s
         operational environment and security requirements. If a product is intended to be secure out-of-
         the-box (e.g., it was secured by the vendor using a security configuration checklist), it is still
         important to check the repository for updates to that checklist.
        Step three involves tailoring and documenting the checklist as necessary to take into account local
         policies and functional requirements, testing the checklist, and providing any feedback to NIST
         and the checklist developers.
        Lastly, step four involves preparation for deploying the checklist, such as making configuration
         or data backups, and then applying the checklist in production.

4
    The program does not list checklists that describe best practices for general technology areas (e.g., firewalls, routers). NIST
    maintains several directories of best practices checklists, as well as links to locations for other checklists, at
    http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/ppsp.html.




                                                               2-3
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




Section 4 contains more details on considerations associated with each step. The checklist description
fields, used when browsing checklist, are summarized in Appendix B.




                                         Figure 2-1: Steps for Checklist Users




For developers, the process is composed of two stages. The first stage involves only developer actions,
whereas the second stage involves interactions between NIST, the developer, and public reviewers. The
first stage contains four steps, as shown in Figure 2-2:

        In step one, the developer becomes familiar with the procedures and requirements of the checklist
         program and completes an agreement to participate in the program.
        In step two, the developer creates, tests, and refines the checklist.
        In step three, the developer documents the checklist according to the guidelines of the program.
        In step four, the developer prepares a checklist submission package and submits it to NIST.




                                                           2-4

In stage two, NIST then performs the remaining four steps, with interaction from the developer and public
reviewers:

       In step five, NIST screens the checklist according to program requirements and addresses any
        issues with the developer.
       The next step is a public review of the checklist, which typically lasts 30 to 60 days. Comments
        submitted during the review are addressed as applicable by the developer and NIST.
       For step seven, NIST posts the checklist on the repository and announces its presence.
       Lastly, step eight involves periodic updates to the checklist and issues of checklist archival.

Checklist development procedures and NIST’s process for screening and publishing the checklist are
described in specific detail in Section 5 and Appendix C.

2.3.3    Common Operational Environments

Checklists are significantly more useful if they can be associated with generic operational environments.
However, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to specify these environments in detail; they must by
necessity remain general so as to be useful to a wide range of audiences. The NIST Checklist Program
identifies several broad and specialized operational environments, any one of which should be common to


                                                     2-5
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




most audiences. By identifying and describing these environments, developers can better target their
checklists to the general security requirements associated with the environments. End-users can better
select the checklists that are most appropriate for their operating environments.

The operational environments are as follows:

        Standalone or Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) describes small, informal computer
         installations that are used for home or business purposes. Standalone encompasses a variety of
         small-scale environments and devices, ranging from laptops, mobile devices, or home computers,
         to telecommuting systems, to small businesses and small branch offices of a company.
        Managed or Enterprise are typically large organizational systems with defined, organized suites
         of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of centrally-managed workstations
         and servers protected from the Internet by firewalls and other network security devices.
        Custom environments contain systems in which the functionality and degree of security do not fit
         the other environments. Two typical Custom environments are Specialized Security-Limited
         Functionality and Legacy:
              o    Specialized Security-Limited Functionality. A Specialized Security-Limited
                   Functionality environment contains systems and networks at high risk of attack or data
                   exposure, with security taking precedence over functionality. It assumes systems have
                   limited or specialized (not general purpose workstations or systems) functionality in a
                   highly threatened environment such as an outward facing firewall or public Web server
                   or whose data content or mission purpose is of such value that aggressive trade-offs in
                   favor of security outweigh the potential negative consequences to other useful system
                   attributes such as legacy applications or interoperability with other systems. Checklists
                   for this environment are not recommended for home users or for large scale general
                   purpose systems. A Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment could be a
                   subset of another environment.
              o    Legacy. A Legacy environment contains older systems or applications that may use
                   older, less-secure communication mechanisms. Other machines operating in a Legacy
                   environment may need less restrictive security settings so that they can communicate
                   with legacy systems and applications. A Legacy environment could be a subset of a
                   Standalone or Managed environment.

Figure 2-3 shows representative Standalone, Managed, and Custom (e.g., Specialized Security-Limited
Functionality) environments. The environments and their general security baselines are further detailed in
Section 3.

2.4        Checklists for Federal Agencies in Meeting FISMA Requirements

Security configuration checklists assist Federal agencies in meeting the security requirements of FISMA.
FISMA (section 3544(b)(2)(D)(iii)) [3] requires each agency to determine minimally acceptable system
configuration requirements and ensure compliance with them. Accordingly, Federal agencies, as well as
vendors of products for the Federal government, are encouraged to acquire or develop and share such
checklists using the NIST repository. The development and sharing of these checklists can greatly reduce
what would otherwise be a “reinvention of the wheel” for IT products that are widely used in the Federal
government, such as common operating systems, servers, and client applications.

3.      NIST Checklist Program Operational Environments

The NIST Checklist Program identifies several broad and custom operational environments, any one of
which should be common to most audiences. Each of the operating environments has a general threat
description and baseline technical security practice.

Users of IT products may find this section useful to consult when initially identifying their own security
requirements and needs (outlined in greater detail in Section 4). Developers may find this section useful
when building checklists; by tailoring checklist development to these environments and their policies,
they can create checklists for diverse products but still adhere to the general uniform technical security
practices and settings associated with the environments. This is discussed in greater detail in Section 5.

The two broad environments are referred to respectively as Standalone (or Small Office/Home Office)
and Managed (or Enterprise). Two typical Custom environments, which could be subsets of the broader
environments, are Specialized Security-Limited Functionality and Legacy. The following sections
describe the environments and discuss threats and baseline technical security recommendations.

Prior to submission of a checklist to NIST, developers should ensure they have the most recent version of
this document, as updates to the criteria for operational environments may occur periodically. The most
recent version is available as a separate file at http://checklists.nist.gov/.5

3.1         Background

To secure something, it is essential to first define the threats that need to be mitigated. Knowledge of
potential threats is important to understanding the reasons behind various baseline technical security
practices that have been chosen for this document.

The threat discussions for each environment represent the major threat categories that were considered
during the selection of the environments and their associated baseline practices. Many threats against
data and resources are possible because of mistakes—either bugs in operating system and application
software that create exploitable vulnerabilities, or errors made by end-users and administrators. Threats
may involve intentional actors (e.g., an attacker who wants to access information on a system) or
unintentional actors (e.g., an administrator who forgets to disable user accounts of a terminated
employee.) Threats can be local, such as a disgruntled employee, or remote, such as an attacker in
another geographical area. Organizations using checklists should conduct risk assessments to identify the
specific threats against their systems and determine the effectiveness of existing security controls in
counteracting the threats, then perform risk mitigation to decide what additional measures (if any) should
be implemented, as discussed in NIST’s Risk Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems
publication [12]. Performing this step permits organizations to better understand their needs and whether
modifications or enhancements need to be made on any selected checklists.

The checklist environment baseline technical security practices are based on commonly accepted
technical security principles and practices, catalogued in various NIST Special Publications [8], [10], [23]
and other sources such as the DoD’s Information Assurance Technical Framework [32]. In particular,
NIST Special Publication 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security (A
Baseline for Achieving Security) [11], contains a set of engineering principles for system security that
provide a foundation upon which a more consistent and structured approach to the design, development,
and implementation of IT security capabilities can be constructed. For additional information, Section 5.1

      NIST may, from time to time as new information becomes available, update the criteria and information for the operational
      environments as well as other criteria contained in this document.

contains detailed discussion of the security-related criteria recommended for developers when building
checklists.

3.2        Standalone Environment

The Standalone environment, sometimes referred to as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), describes
small, informal computer installations. This environment encompasses a wide variety of operational
settings, from a home computer used for occasional work purposes to a small branch office of a company
in another geographical area that is not managed remotely for technical or business reasons. Figure 3-1
shows a typical Standalone network architecture.

The Standalone environment assumes the following end-user audiences and operational settings:

         Home users with standalone systems, generally with dial-up or high-speed access to the Internet,
          possibly using wired or wireless home networks, possibly sharing resources across the networks
         Telecommuters using standalone systems who work from a home office
         Small businesses, typically with small networks of standalone desktop systems and small office
          servers protected from direct Internet access by a firewall, but possibly including some small
          centrally-managed networks of desktop systems and products, and typically not maintaining
          publicly-accessible servers
         Other small organizations with similar functions.




                            Figure 3-1: Home Office Standalone Environment Example

Standalone environments are typically the least secured. The individuals performing Standalone system
administration are assumed to be less knowledgeable about security. This often results in environments
that are less secure than they should be because the focus is on functionality. In some instances, there
may be no network-based security controls such as firewalls, so Standalone systems may be directly
exposed to external attacks. Standalone environments are frequently targeted for exploitation—not


                                                           3-2
                                                 SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




necessarily to acquire information, but instead for the purpose of attacking other computers, or
incidentally as collateral damage from the propagation of a worm.

Standalone checklists should be relatively simple to understand and implement by home users or novice
system administrators in small organizations.

3.2.1     Threat Discussion and Recommended Technical Security Practices

Because the primary threats in Standalone environments are external, and Standalone devices generally
have less restrictive security policies than Managed or Specialized Security-Limited Functionality
systems, they tend to be most vulnerable to attacks from remote threat categories. Local threats are often
less significant because few people typically have local access to Standalone systems; however, it is still
important to protect against local and other threats. Standalone systems are typically exposed to attacks
against network services and by malicious payloads (e.g., viruses, worms). These attacks are most likely
to affect availability (e.g., crashing the system, consuming all network bandwidth, breaking functionality)
but may also affect integrity (e.g., infecting data files) and confidentiality (e.g., providing remote access
to sensitive data, e-mailing data files to others).

The baseline technical security practices for the Standalone environment include protecting IT systems
and products from the common out-of-the-box configuration vulnerabilities, blocking external access to
the network, and restricting local access when possible. The adoption of inexpensive, hardware-based
firewall routers and personal firewalls can help to better secure Standalone environments. Another key to
Standalone security is strengthening the hosts on the Standalone network by patching vulnerabilities and
altering settings to restrict unneeded services and applications. Some commonly accepted security
practices for Standalone environments are:

       Use of small hardware firewall appliances at Internet connections to block inbound connections
        and possibly to filter outbound traffic also
       Use of personal firewall products on standalone systems
       Application (e.g., antivirus software, Web browser, e-mail client) and operating system updates
        and patches applied regularly
       Web and e-mail clients configured to filter and block traffic/messages that could contain
        malicious content
       Unnecessary applications disabled (e.g., personal Web servers, SNMP, messaging)
       Encryption used for wireless network traffic and as appropriate for other traffic
       Restrictions on which systems/users can connect to wired and wireless LANs
       Restrictions on user privileges
       Restrictions on sharing resources such as directories or printers
       Backup and recovery procedures
       Physical security procedures.
NIST and other security publications can be consulted for additional guidance in security practices related
to Standalone environments. Users may find the guidance on system administration for Microsoft
Windows® systems [13], [26], telecommuting [14], and wireless network security [15] particularly




                                                     3-3
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




useful. NIST has a variety of security-related special publications and general security guidance available
on its computer security Web site.6

3.3          Managed Environment

The Managed environment, sometimes referred to as Enterprise, is generally for centrally-managed
networks of IT products protected from direct Internet access by firewalls. Figure 3-2 shows a typical
enterprise network architecture. As an example, it would include networked printers and multi-function
devices, managed workstations, and internal servers.

The Managed environment audience generally includes medium to large businesses, large governmental
agencies, and organizations requiring managed telecommuting systems and remote offices. Managed
checklists are generally intended for advanced end-users and system administrators in a medium to large
organization. Managed environments typically have a group dedicated to supporting users and providing
security. The combination of structure and skilled staff allows better security practices to be implemented
during initial system deployment and in ongoing support and maintenance. The managed nature of
typical Managed environments gives administrators centralized control over various settings on
workstations, servers, and other types of devices, as well as the sharing of resources (e.g., file servers,
printers). The enterprise enables only the services needed for normal business operations, with other
possible avenues of exploit removed or disabled. Authentication, account, and policy management can
also be administered centrally to maintain a consistent security posture across an organization.

3.3.1        Threat Discussion and Recommended Technical Security Practices

Remote and local threats to Managed networks could have significant impacts to systems and
applications. Managed organizations often have systems with permanent, well-known IP addresses and
name spaces with high visibility on the Internet to attackers. Most systems on enterprise networks are
usually inward-facing—protected from direct exposure to the Internet by firewalls—but penetrations of
those systems through other means could permit intruder access to internal networks. For example,
viruses and worms could spread across homogenous networks in a short amount of time. Also, in
Managed environments, the insider threat is generally greater due to the larger number of users.

The Managed environment is more restrictive and provides less functionality than the Standalone
environment. However, Managed environments typically have better control on the flow of various types
of traffic, such as filtering traffic based on protocols and ports at the enterprise’s connections with
external networks. Because of the supported and largely homogeneous nature of the Managed
environment, it is typically easier to use more functionally restrictive settings in Managed environments
than in Standalone environments. Managed environments also tend to implement several layers of
defense (e.g., firewalls, antivirus servers, intrusion detection systems, patch management systems, e-mail
filtering), which provides greater protection for systems.

                                                 SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




                            Figure 3-2: Centrally Managed Environment Example



In the Managed environment, systems are typically susceptible to local and remote threats. Local attacks,
such as unauthorized usage of another user’s workstation, most often lead to a loss of confidentiality (e.g.,
unauthorized access to data) but may also lead to a loss of integrity (e.g., data modification) or availability
(e.g., theft of a system). Remote threats may be posed not only by attackers outside the organization, but
also by local users who are attacking other local systems across the organization’s network. Most
security breaches caused by remote threats involve malicious payloads sent by external parties, such as
viruses and worms acquired via e-mail or infected Web sites. Threats against network-based applications
tend to affect a smaller number of systems and may be caused by internal or external parties. Both
malicious payloads and network application attacks are most likely to affect availability (e.g., crashing the



                                                     3-5
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




system, consuming all network bandwidth, breaking functionality) but may also affect integrity (e.g.,
infecting data files) or confidentiality (e.g., providing remote access to sensitive data). Data disclosure
threats tend to come from internal parties who are monitoring traffic on local networks, and they
primarily affect confidentiality.

Some commonly accepted security practices for Managed environments are as follows:

         Segmented internal networks with internal firewalls and other defense in depth techniques
         Centralized management of systems with highly restricted local user access
         Centralized management of security-related applications such as antivirus
         Automated installation of system and application patches and updates
         Restricted access to printer and multi-function devices and their features
         Centralized systems for log monitoring
         Centralized backup and recovery facilities.
Security publications can be consulted for additional guidance in security practices related to Managed
environments. NIST has produced a variety of special publications particularly useful for the Managed
operational environment. Relevant publications available from NIST’s security web site include guidance
for system administration of Microsoft Windows systems [13], [26], wireless network security [15],
active content and mobile code [16], security patches [18], firewalls [19], network security testing [20],
and incident handling [25].

3.4        Specialized Security-Limited Functionality Custom Environment

A Custom environment contains systems in which the functionality and degree of security do not fit the
other environments. The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality is a typical Custom environment
that is highly restrictive and secure; it is usually reserved for systems that have the highest threats and
associated impacts. Typical examples of such systems are outward-facing Web, e-mail, and DNS servers,
other publicly accessed systems, and firewalls. It also encompasses computers that contain confidential
information (e.g., central repository of personnel records, medical records, financial information) or
perform vital organizational functions (e.g., accounting, payroll processing, air traffic control). These
systems might be targeted by third parties for exploitation, but also might be targeted by trusted parties
inside the organization.

A Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment could be a subset of another environment. For
example, three desktops in a Managed environment that hold the organization’s confidential employee
data could be thought of as a Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment within a Managed
environment. In addition, a laptop used by a mobile worker, e.g., organization management might be a
Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment in a Standalone environment. A Specialized
Security-Limited Functionality environment might also be a self-contained environment outside any other
environment, such as a government security installation processing sensitive data.

Specialized Security-Limited Functionality checklists are intended for experienced security specialists
and seasoned system administrators who understand the impact of implementing strict technical security
practices. If home users and other users without deep security expertise attempt to apply Specialized
Security-Limited Functionality checklists to their systems, they would typically experience unwanted
limitations on system functionality and possibly unrecoverable system damage.

3.4.1    Threat Discussion and Recommended Technical Security Practices

Systems in this environment face the same threats as systems in Managed environments. Although
threats from insider attacks are still a large concern, the primary attack vector is likely to be external.
Systems may be directly connected to the Internet, and as in the Managed environment, may have
permanent, well-known IP addresses and name spaces with high visibility to attackers. Systems may be
subject to automated intrusions and denial of service attacks, as well as manual intrusions. Penetrations
of firewalls and servers could lead to local attacks and intrusions. Local threats may be high if the
systems are connected to large networks with many users, or may be less if connected to smaller
networks. Because of the risks and possible consequences of a compromise, this environment usually has
the most functionally restrictive and secure configuration. The suggested configuration provides the
greatest protection with considerable tradeoffs to ease of use, functionality, and remote system
management.

It is difficult to specify technical security practices except in very general terms because many disparate
types of systems and applications could, depending on how they are used, qualify as Specialized Security-
Limited Functionality. However, the following general practices and controls are likely to be applicable:

       Systems should generally process as few types of data as possible (e.g., do not combine multiple
        server applications on the same system).
       Systems should be stripped of all unnecessary services and applications.
       If possible, host-based firewall applications should be used.
       Systems should have as few users as needed.
       The strongest possible authentication should be used (e.g., authentication token, biometrics, smart
        cards).
       Remote administration or access should be restricted; if used, connections should be encrypted.
       Security-related operating system and application patches and updates should be tested and
        applied as soon as possible.
       Systems should be placed behind firewalls and other network security devices that restrict access
        and filter unnecessary protocols.
       Intrusion detection and other logs should be monitored on a frequent basis.
       Vulnerability assessment tools should be run against the systems on a frequent basis.
       System administrators should be highly skilled in the appropriate technologies.
NIST and other organizations have recommended security practices for firewalls [19], Web servers [21],
and e-mail servers [22]. The publications mentioned previously for the Standalone and enterprise
environments also should be consulted for detailed recommendations.

3.5      Legacy Environments

Legacy is another example of a Custom environment for situations in which legacy systems may need to
be combined with newer equipment and secured to meet today’s threats. The threat discussion can vary
widely.




                                Figure 3-4: Legacy Environment Example



One example of a Legacy environment is shown in Figure 3-4. Warehouse workers use wireless PDA
devices to collect inventory for shipping and receiving. The PDAs cannot be inexpensively upgraded to
support wireless protocols with encryption (e.g., WEP or WPA). However, the location and structure of
the warehouse prevents easy intercepts of the wireless traffic. Due to cost considerations, a risk
determination was made and a Legacy environment checklist was created for the server/wireless access
point.




                              Figure 3-5: Legacy Workstation Environment




                                                  3-9
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




Figure 3-5 shows another simple example of a Legacy environment in which older workstations must be
part of a network using more recent server technology. The older workstations cannot support newer,
more robust aspects of the newer technology, such as a more secure file sharing protocol, file system, or
authentication protocol. Consequently, modifications need to be made to support the legacy workstations.
In this case, the server would require a Legacy environment checklist.

4.    Checklist Usage

This section describes a high-level process for checklist users to follow when retrieving and using
checklists. Although all checklist users, ranging from home users to system administrators at large
organizations, have their specific requirements, the process described here will apply to most situations.
This section includes guidance on conducting an initial analysis of local environment threats and risks,
and the impacts if threats were to occur. It then describes a process for selecting and retrieving checklists
from the NIST checklist repository, and recommends steps for analyzing, tailoring, and applying the
checklist.




                                Figure 4-1: Checklist User Process Overview



Figure 4-1 shows the general process for using checklists. In step one, a prospective checklist user
analyzes local requirements and security needs or policy and identifies the appropriate operational
environment model. The user then selects the IT product that best matches the needs. In step two, the
user browses the repository for checklists that match the IT product and the selected operational
environment (and possibly other criteria, such as whether the checklist can be rolled back or whether it is
supported by the product vendor). The user downloads the checklists along with any supporting
documents and tools. In step three, the user reviews the downloaded checklists and tests and customizes


                                                     4-1
SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




them to reflect local policy and functionality as needed. Feedback on the checklists can be sent to NIST
and the developer via the repository. In step four, the user prepares to apply the checklists in production
by backing up information that might be affected if the application of the checklists isn't successful or
causes unanticipated problems. Finally, the checklists can be applied to production systems. The
following sections describe each of these steps in more detail.

4.1        Determining Local Requirements

Organizations usually conduct a requirements analysis before actually selecting and purchasing a
particular IT product. The analysis would include an identification of the needs of the organization (what
the product must do) and the security requirements for the product (e.g., relevant security policies).
Individual end-users can conduct the same process, although it could be quite informal. Since security is
difficult to add later, assessing requirements upfront is a better method for incorporating security into IT
operations, big or small.

NIST Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems [12],
contains useful guidance for Federal agencies on conducting a requirements analysis and a subsequent
risk assessment. Organizations use risk assessments to determine the extent of the potential threat and the
risk associated with an IT system or product throughout its lifecycle. The output of this process helps to
identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk. (Risk is a function of the likelihood of a
given threat-source exercising a particular potential vulnerability and the resulting impact of that adverse
event on the organization.) Organizations other than Federal agencies can also benefit by following the
methodology in SP 800-30.

The methodology includes steps that are straightforward and simple, even for the individual home user
who may not be especially savvy with regard to IT security. Important steps include the following:

         Identifying Functional Needs. What must the product do? Identifying upfront the end-user’s
          requirements, such as remote access for telecommuters or a web server to make internal
          information available to employees, is necessary so that the appropriate security controls can be
          selected that implement an appropriate security solution and still meet the requirements for
          functionality.
         Identifying Threats and Vulnerabilities. A threat is the potential for a particular threat-source
          to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. A vulnerability is a weakness that can be
          accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited. The goal of this step is to identify potential
          threat-sources that are applicable to the IT product or system being considered, as well as the
          vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the potential threat-sources.
         Identifying Security Needs. The goal of this step is to determine the controls needed to
          minimize or eliminate the likelihood (or probability) of a threat exercising a product or system
          vulnerability. It answers the question, “What security features must the product provide?”
          Armed with this information, the organization can make wiser choices as to which IT product
          best meets their needs.
Federal agencies conduct formal requirements analysis and risk assessments as outlined in SP 800-30.
For any organization or individual, the threat discussions and general security practices associated with
each operational environment in Section 3 can assist in identifying threats and vulnerabilities, and
recommended security policies. For example, a home user could study the discussion in Section 3 on the
Standalone operational environment prior to purchasing a product (assuming that the home user's
environment matches up well with Standalone). Given that the home user understands their requirements
and the type of product that should be acquired, the home user can use the Standalone environment’s



                                                           4-2
                                                             SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




security model and general recommendations to make an informed choice as to which product best meets
the needs.

NIST has also written several documents and guides to assist Federal agencies when selecting
information security products and for the acquisition and use of tested/evaluated products [10], [17].
Another key resource available at NIST for identifying vulnerability-related information about IT
products is the ICAT tool.7 This tool provides a product-by-product index to identified system
vulnerabilities and information on patches available to correct the vulnerabilities.

4.2          Browsing and Retrieving Checklists

After determining local requirements and identifying an IT product, a checklist user is ready to browse
the NIST checklist repository. Figure 4-2 shows a sample repository home page. The checklists can be
browsed by the main IT product category, by the IT product manufacturer, and by the submitting
organizations that have produced the checklist.




                                     Figure 4-2: NIST Checklist Repository Home Page

SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




Selecting a particular checklist will show a description template that includes extensive information to
help users decide whether the checklist will suit their specific purposes (the listing and definition of all
the fields used to describe each checklist is in Appendix B). Depending on a user's needs, role, and skills
(e.g., home user, enterprise administrator), some fields in the description will be more important than
others. Table 4-1 lists fields that should be helpful to all users in determining whether the checklist meets
their specific needs.

4.3       Reviewing, Customizing and Documenting, and Testing Checklists

Checklist users should download all documentation for the checklist and review it carefully. The
documentation should explain any required preparatory activities, such as backing up a system. Because
a checklist will not match exactly the user’s specific requirements, the review is useful in determining
whether the checklist may need to be modified or if the system or product will require further
modifications after applying the checklist.

For larger organizations, the review can identify the impact on their current policies and practices if a
given security checklist is implemented (e.g., a checklist that turns off JavaScript in a browser might
make some web pages unusable). An organization may determine that some aspects of the checklist do
not conform to certain organization-specific needs and requirements. Organizations should tailor the
checklists to reflect local rules, regulations, and mandates. Because the checklist may be applied many
times over within the organization, the checklist itself might need to be modified. This is especially likely
if the checklist includes a script or template to be applied to systems.

At this point, any changes to the checklist should be documented for future reference. Feedback can be
sent to NIST as well as the checklist developers; feedback is especially important to developers in
gauging whether the checklist is written well and the settings are applicable to the targeted environment.

Before applying a checklist, users should first test it on non-critical systems, preferably in a controlled
non-operational environment (albeit testing may be difficult for home or small business users who do not
have extra systems and networks for testing purposes). The testing configuration of the IT product should
match the deployment configuration. In some cases, a security control modification can have a negative
impact on a product’s functionality and usability, or on other products or security controls. For example,
installing a patch could inadvertently break another patch, or enabling a firewall could inadvertently block
antivirus software from updating its signatures or disrupt patch management software. Consequently, it is
important to perform testing to determine the impact on system security, functionality, and usability, and
to take appropriate steps to address any significant issues. Section 4.4 contains recommendations for
performing backups and other suggestions to prevent or recover from potential damage or unwanted
effects that could occur if applying an untested checklist.

4.4       Applying Checklists to IT Products

Each checklist will include specific installation instructions to assist with deployment. Even after review
and testing, users should handle deployment carefully to minimize any issues that might arise from
applying a security checklist.

For users unable to test a checklist in a non-operational environment (e.g., home users), it is all the more
important to carefully review the checklist documentation completely and determine whether an initial
backup is required or a good idea. The Rollback Capability field within the checklist description (see
Table 4-1) will indicate whether the checklist can be reversed, returning the product to the original
configuration. Regardless of this setting, backing up the IT product’s configuration prior to installing the
checklist recommendations is strongly recommended.

Users should minimally back up all critical data files in their computing environment. If possible, a full
backup of the system should be made in the event they need to restore the system to a state prior to
implementing the checklist. (This is actually a recommended practice before making any major system
change and is not specific to applying a checklist.) Large organizations should also follow this procedure
and, if possible, first select several operational systems as pilots to provide ‘real-world’ testing for the
checklist prior to enterprise-wide deployment.

Depending on the product, a checklist may be updated periodically or frequently, and NIST may maintain
a mailing address for selected checklists. Users who subscribe will receive announcements of updates or
other issues connected with a checklist. The selected checklist's description on the checklist repository
will contain subscription instructions.

NIST welcomes all feedback, bug reports, comments, or suggestions from checklist users in regards to
individual checklists or the repository itself. Where applicable, NIST will encourage feedback from
checklist users so that the developers are better able to gauge the effectiveness and appropriateness of the
checklist.

5.    Checklist Development

This section describes the general process of developing security configuration checklists and submitting
them to the NIST Checklist Program. It includes an overview of the process NIST will follow to screen
the checklist submissions and publish them in its repository, and the process NIST and developers will
follow for eventual updates to the checklist or checklist archival. Individual developers and organizations
that wish to submit checklists to NIST should review the appendices of this document, which contain the
administrative requirements for the NIST Checklist Program. Prior to submission of a checklist to NIST,
developers should ensure they have the most recent version of this document. The most recent version is
available as a separate file at http://checklists.nist.gov/.




                          Figure 5-1: NIST Checklist Program Development Steps



The lifecycle steps shown in Figure 5-1 are straightforward. Each step should be followed so that the
checklist is accurate, tested, and documented during its development and subsequent publication, update,
or archival. The following sections describe considerations for each step.

5.1         Background on Security-Related Criteria for Checklists

This section discusses the security-related criteria that NIST recommends developers follow so that
technical security policies practices in checklists are more consistent. NIST recognizes that detailed
checklist development cannot be covered extensively in this document. Therefore, NIST has based the
security-related criteria on commonly accepted technical security principles and practices, as catalogued
in NIST Special Publication 800-53 [23], other NIST publications [8], [10], and other literature [32].
Additional considerations are contained in NIST SP 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information
Technology Security (A Baseline for Achieving Security) [11]. To aid in designing secure information
systems, NIST compiled a set of engineering principles for system security discussed in this document.
These principles provide a foundation upon which a more consistent and structured approach to the
design, development, and implementation of IT security capabilities can be constructed. SP 800-27’s
guidance is based in part on the Information Assurance Technical Framework (IATF) [32].

The checklist needs to be consistent with one of the general operational environment described in Section
3 (excepting the Custom environment). This will require consulting the guidance in Section 3, the
checklist format and content guidelines in the remainder of this section and in Appendix C, and other
generally recommended practices and procedures. If no recommended practices guidance is yet available
for a product or class of products, general security recommended practices should be used (e.g., defense
in depth and layered security; least privilege, confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls).

In terms of vulnerability coverage, the security objectives should take into account the most up-to-date
vulnerabilities and generally be consistent with recognized sources of vulnerability-related information,
including the DHS US-CERT, the CERT/CC, and NIST’s ICAT.8 The security objectives should be
consistent with recognized checklist-producing organizations including NIST [13], [26], the National
Security Agency (NSA) [36], the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) produced by the
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [37], and the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
benchmarks [38].9

Developers of checklists for products that will be used in the Federal government may wish to consult the
FISMA-associated security control baselines. NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems [23], provides a catalog of security controls; it uses groupings of the
controls to create three minimum baseline security control sets for Federal information systems—low,
moderate, and high impact as specified in FIPS 199 [27]. It may be useful for developers of checklists
aimed towards the Federal government to build checklists that help Federal agencies meet the applicable
security controls in SP 800-53. Developers of IT products that will be employed in federal information
systems can help federal agencies meet the mandatory requirements in FISMA by creating checklists that
will provide recommended configuration settings in a variety of operational environments or for
information systems of differing impact levels as described in FIPS 199 and SP 800-53.

5.2         Developer Steps for Creating and Submitting Checklists

The first four steps in the development methodology (from Figure 5-1, summarized below in Figure 5-2)
begin with the developer becoming familiar with the procedures and requirements of the checklist
program, and then performing the initial development of the checklist. From there, the developer tests the
checklist and refines it as needed. The third step involves documenting the checklist according to the
guidelines of the program. Finally, the developer prepares and submits a checklist submission package to

NIST for screening and public review. The sections below describe various considerations in each of
these steps.




                                     Figure 5-2: Initial Checklist Development Stages



5.2.1       Initial Checklist Development

In this step, a developer becomes familiar with the requirements of the checklist program and all
procedures involved during the checklist lifecycle (as described throughout this section). At this point, a
developer would presumably agree to the participation requirements of the program before continuing
further to build the checklist. The participation requirements of the program are described in this
document but are laid out in administrative and programmatic terms in Appendix C, which is intended
less for technical developers and more for those in developer organizations who would need to formally
agree to the program’s requirements. The participation agreement itself is contained in Appendix D.10

The developer then decides which operational environment from Section 3 should be implemented by the
checklist, and builds the checklist accordingly, using the security-related criteria from Sections 3 and 5.1.
The output of this step is an initial checklist for the product.

Appendix B describes the complete set of fields for a checklist description on the repository; users can
browse and view these fields when using the repository. Table 5-1 shows fields of the checklist
description that would be completed at this step:

      Tools                        system, if they are not included with the checklist.



5.2.2      Checklist Testing

Before a checklist is submitted to NIST, it should be fully tested in a configuration that meets the target
environment and platform. The checklist should be tested with a variety of applications and hardware
platforms, if applicable. The testing data does not need to be submitted to NIST; however, the developer
should retain it for review as appropriate.

Table 5-2 shows fields in the checklist description that would be completed at this step.

                                Table 5-2: Fields Completed During Checklist Testing


          Field Name                                             Description

      Rollback Capability
                               can be rolled back and, if so, how to rollback the changes.



Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls can be a daunting task, because many security
controls have limited system functionality and usability. In some cases, a security control can even have
a negative impact on other security controls. For example, installing a patch could inadvertently break
another patch, or enabling a firewall could inadvertently block antivirus software from updating its
signatures or disrupt patch management software. Therefore, it is important to perform testing for all
security controls to determine what impact they have on system security, functionality, and usability, and
to take appropriate steps to address any significant issues.

NIST has produced SP 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing [20], to assist administrators in
testing systems for vulnerabilities and configuration problems. Although this publication is more focused
on testing systems instead of individual IT products, it may still be useful to checklist developers.

5.2.3     Documenting the Checklist

The quality of checklist documentation often makes a major difference in the checklist’s effectiveness.
The checklist documentation should clearly explain how to install the checklist, using concise, sound, and
complete instructions. The skill level required to install the checklist needs to be identified, as well as the
targeted environment. The documentation should also explain the significance of individual settings,
including any changes to product functionality. The documentation should also include procedures to
verify that the checklist installation is successful, as well as guidance for uninstalling the checklist or
restoring the product to a state prior to installation of the checklist. In some cases, it may not be possible
to roll back checklist settings, in which case the checklist documentation should recommend procedures
such as backups and system restoration as applicable.

The testing methodology, such as how the checklist was tested and what platforms were used, should be
documented. The checklist documentation should also contain troubleshooting information if errors
occur or the checklist settings cause the product to operate incorrectly. Ideally, assistance is available for
(registered) users of the product in case of problems.

Table 5-3 shows additional fields in the checklist description that would be completed in this step.

                                  Table 5-3: Additional Documentation Fields

 Comments, Warnings,
 Disclaimer,               Any additional information that the checklist developer wishes to convey to users.
 Miscellaneous



The developer needs to complete the fields as indicated to describe the checklist accurately and reduce
possible user confusion as to what the checklist accomplishes.

In summary, well-structured checklist documentation includes the following, as appropriate:

        Complete and accurate checklist description
        Statement of the security objectives, including the targeted environment and the expected
         behavior of the product after applying the checklist
        The target audience (e.g., end-user, system administrator) and the level of technical skill required
         to install the checklist

         Backup procedures or any other initial steps required before applying the checklist
         As appropriate, step-by-step instructions for applying the checklist (e.g., screen shots, illustrated
          procedures) and verifying that the installation is successful
         Procedures for uninstalling the checklist (if applicable)
         Troubleshooting instructions or other information and references.

5.2.4      Checklist Package Submission to NIST

At this point, the checklist developer has completed, tested, and documented the checklist, and now
submits the package of materials to NIST. The package includes:

         The checklist and configuration files, templates, scripts, etc.
         The completed checklist description
         The checklist documentation
         Identification of the developer point of contact
         A signed participation agreement.
The participation agreement and other requirements are outlined in more detail in Appendix C. This
appendix also includes the appropriate NIST contact information.

5.3        NIST Steps for Reviewing and Finalizing Checklists for Publication

NIST’s process for screening and publishing the checklist is described within the following sections.
Figure 5-3 shows the general steps; steps 4 and 5 may loop depending on the amount of feedback to the
developer. Steps 6 and 8 may repeat depending on the magnitude of updates to an already published
checklist (most changes should not require additional public reviews).

5.3.1      Checklist Package Screening

This step determines if the checklist is sufficiently accurate and complete to be publicly reviewed. NIST
will screen the checklist materials for completeness and accuracy, and examine testing procedures used to

evaluate the checklist. The developer may be contacted with questions about the submitted materials
during the screening period. NIST will complete the screening and, if all issues are addressed, post the
checklist and description as a candidate for a period of typically 30 to 60 days.

Section 5.1 describes criteria for checklist and checklist description development; the criteria are used
also for screening the checklist. Essentially, the security objectives of the checklist should be consistent
with recommended guidance from NIST and other recognized security organizations, and guidance from
other checklist producing organizations. The checklist must be documented according to the guidelines in
this section and in Appendix C. Some of the questions typically posed by NIST when screening checklist
submissions include the following:

       Documentation
            o   Does it specify the target audience?
            o   Does it identify the targeted environment?
            o   Does it explain the security objectives?
            o   Does it contain a complete, clear, and concise description of the checklist settings?
       Best Practices
            o   Are the checklist settings consistent with recommended practices?
            o   Do the checklist settings take into account recent vulnerabilities?
       Impact of Settings
            o   Has the checklist developer tested the checklist settings on the product in a real-world
                environment and determined that the checklist settings cause the product to meet the
                security objectives of the checklist?
            o   Do any of the checklist settings cause the product to become inoperable or unstable?
            o   Do certain checklist settings reduce product functionality? If so, is this documented?
       Ease of Implementation
            o   Is the checklist straightforward to apply?
            o   Are the instructions concise, sound, and complete?
            o   Is the required skill level identified?
            o   Are procedures to verify that the installation is successful included?
            o   Is there guidance for uninstalling the checklist or restoring the product to the state prior to
                installation?

        If the checklist developer is NOT the IT product’s vendor, does the documentation indicate
         whether the checklist has been sponsored or endorsed by the IT product’s vendor?

5.3.2      Candidate Checklist Public Review

Once the checklist has been screened and the developer has addressed any issues, NIST will post it for
public review for a period of typically 30 to 60 days. This will allow the public to review and test the
checklist, and provide the checklist developers and NIST with comments and feedback. These may be
incorporated in a revision of the checklist to improve its quality. When a candidate checklist has
completed the review process, it will be included in the checklist repository.

A reviewer will complete a standardized feedback form to capture comments as well as other information
regarding the reviewer’s test environment, procedures, and other relevant information. Depending on the
review, the checklist developer may need to respond to comments. NIST may also consult independent
expert reviewers as appropriate. Typical reasons for using independent reviewers include the following:

        NIST may determine that it does not possess the expertise to determine whether the comments
         have been addressed satisfactorily.
        NIST may disagree with the proposed issue resolutions and decide to seek reviews from third
         parties.
At the end of the public review period, NIST will announce that the comment period is closed.
Depending upon the number of comments received and the ramifications of those comments to the
checklist, NIST will determine a timeframe in which the developer must respond to comments, which will
typically range from 15 to 30 days from the end of the review period.

5.3.3      Final Listing, Maintenance, and Archival

After any outstanding issues are addressed, NIST will list the final checklist and announce the inclusion
of the checklist on the repository. At this time, the developer (e.g., an IT product vendor) may be eligible
to use the checklist logo on the IT product’s promotional material if the developer provides assistance for
the checklist. Requirements for usage of the logo are described in Appendix D.

NIST will also announce procedures for accepting further comments or questions regarding the checklist
throughout its remaining lifecycle. Depending on the product and how frequently updates may occur,
NIST may maintain a mailing address for the associated checklists. Users who subscribe can receive
announcements of updates or other issues connected with a checklist. The selected checklist's description
(on the checklist repository) will contain subscription instructions. Throughout the checklist lifecycle,
NIST will continue to collect feedback and pass this information to the checklist developer.

When the final checklist is listed, NIST will set a periodic review schedule with the developer. Typically,
the timeframe for the review will be one year; however, it could be sooner depending on certain factors
such as the discovery of new vulnerabilities. If the developer decides to update the checklist, NIST will
announce that the checklist is in the process of being updated. If the checklist contains major changes, it
will be accepted as if it were a new submission; it must undergo the same reviews as a new submission.

At the developer’s discretion, the checklist can be removed from the repository or reclassified as an
archive. Typical reasons would include that the product is no longer supported or is obsolete, or that the
developer no longer wishes to provide support for the checklist.

1. Overview and General Considerations

This section focuses on general considerations for all parts of the NIST Checklist Program.

(a) Checklist Lifecycle Overview: Checklists typically have the following lifecycle:

        1. Checklist developers inquire about the program and download a submission package. The
           developer subsequently contacts NIST with a tested checklist and supporting information,
           and a signed agreement to the requirements of the NIST Checklist Program. General
           information about checklists is discussed in Section 1. Checklist submission requirements
           and procedures are discussed in Section 2.
        2. NIST verifies that all information is complete and performs a screening on the checklist.
           Checklists meeting the requirements for listing receive further consideration and are referred
           to as “candidate checklists.” Section 2 discusses screening criteria and procedures. Section
           1d discusses issue resolution processes.
        3. NIST lists the candidate on the repository for a public review period of typically 30 to 60
           days, as discussed in Section 3.
        4. NIST forwards comments from public reviewers to the developer. When all issues are
           addressed, the checklist is listed on the FCL, as discussed in Section 4.
        5. The developer contacts NIST on typically an annual basis to determine whether the listing
           should continue, be updated, or archived, as discussed in Section 5.

(b) Intellectual Property Rights: Developers retain intellectual property rights in their checklists.

(c) Confidential Information: NIST does not anticipate the need to receive confidential information
    from checklist developers. If it becomes necessary to disclose confidential information to NIST,
    NIST and the developer must enter into a separate confidentiality agreement prior to such disclosure.

(d) Independent Qualified Reviewers: NIST may decide to seek technical advice from independent
    qualified experts who will review checklist submissions to determine whether they meet the program
    requirements. The reviewers are tasked with making a recommendation to NIST regarding a
    subsequent public review or final listing of the checklist. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for
    using independent reviewers include the following:

        1. NIST does not possess the expertise to determine whether issues have been addressed
           satisfactorily.
        2. NIST disagrees with proposed issue resolutions.

(e) Terminating Consideration of a Checklist Submission: NIST or the developer may terminate
    consideration of checklist submissions at any time. If NIST terminates consideration, the points of
    contact are asked to respond within 10 business days. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for
    terminating consideration of checklist submissions are the following:

        1. The submission package does not meet the screening criteria.
        2. The developer fails to address issues raised at other times.
        3. The developer violates the terms and conditions of participation in the program.

2. Checklist Submission and Screening

This section outlines the procedures and requirements for submitting checklists to NIST and the process
by which NIST determines that checklists are suitable for public review. When checklists meet the
screening requirements, they receive further consideration in a public review and are referred to as
“candidate checklists”. NIST then follows the subsequent procedures.

(a) Notification of Checklist Program Requirements: NIST maintains on the repository a complete set
    of information for developers. The information outlines the requirements for participation in the
    program and describes materials and timeframes.

(b) Materials Required from the Developer: Developers provide the following information, all in the
    English language:

         1. Contact information for an individual from the submitting organization who will serve as the
            point of contact for questions and comments pertaining to the checklist, and contact
            information for a backup or deputy point of contact. The information must include postal
            address, direct telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address.
         2. The checklist, documentation, and description template.
         3. The participation agreement, which must be printed, signed, and sent to NIST. NIST accepts
            e-mailed PDF copies of the participation agreement, facsimiles, or copies via regular mail.
         4. Participation fees. Currently, there is no fee to checklist developers. NIST reserves the right
            to charge fees for participation in the future. Fees are not retroactive.

(c) Preliminary Screening Checklist Contents: NIST performs a preliminary screening to verify that
    checklists meet the program requirements. The following paragraphs summarize the screening
    criteria, which is described more fully in NIST Special Publication 800-70.

         1. The checklist settings reflect consideration of recommended security and engineering
            practices.
         2. The checklist contains a complete, clear, and concise description of the configuration settings.
         3. The checklist has been tested and configuration or compatibility issues have been identified.
         4. The documentation explains how to install or uninstall the checklist.
         5. Checklist-related help is available.

3. Candidate Checklist Public Review

NIST follows the subsequent procedures when listing candidate checklists for public review.

(a) Public Review Period: NIST typically lists candidates for a 30 to 60 day comment period. NIST
    reserves the right to extend the review cycle, particularly for long or complicated checklists. NIST
    uses the following disclaimer (or very similar words) in conjunction with candidate checklists:

         NIST does not guarantee or warrant the checklist’s accuracy or completeness. NIST is not
         responsible for loss, damage, or problems that may be caused by using the checklist.


                                                           C-4

(b) Accepting Comments from Reviewers: Public reviewers complete a web-based feedback form to
    capture their comments as well as other information regarding the reviewer’s test environment,
    procedures, and other relevant information. The contents of the feedback forms are considered public
    records.

(c) Maintaining Records: NIST maintains copies of all correspondence and feedback between the
    public and developers by creating a unique e-mail address for each checklist. NIST will archive the
    information.

(d) Addressing Comments: At the end of the public review period, NIST announces that the comment
    period is closed. Depending upon the number of comments received and the ramifications of those
    comments to the checklist settings, NIST determines a timeframe in which the developer must
    respond to comments. This typically ranges from 15 to 30 days from the date the comments were
    submitted or from the end of the review period. At no time will this period be less than 15 days.

4. Final Checklist Listing

After NIST determines that checklists and associated developers have met all requirements for final
listing, NIST lists checklists in the FCL and refers to them as “final checklists.” NIST then follows the
subsequent procedures.

(a) Finalizing Checklists: NIST lists the checklist in the FCL. NIST may send announcements to
    various e-mail lists maintained by NIST or other organizations. NIST uses the following disclaimer
    (or very similar words) for final checklists:

        NIST does not guarantee or warrant the checklist’s accuracy or completeness. NIST is not
        responsible for loss, damage, or problem, that may be caused by using the checklist.

(b) Handling Comments: NIST continues to accept comments regarding final checklists by maintaining
    a central electronic mailing address on the repository. NIST lists the procedures for contacting the
    developer, along with information for contacting the developer, such as e-mail addresses or URLs.

(c) Scheduling Periodic Reviews: NIST determines whether a final checklist should be reviewed
    periodically and typically sets the review timeframe for one year. NIST may request that a checklist
    be reviewed sooner for reasons such as new vulnerabilities or threats. NIST schedules reviews with
    the developer’s points of contact. If at any time the point of contact changes, NIST must be notified
    immediately.

5. Final Checklist Update, Archival, and Delisting

NIST follows the subsequent procedures for periodic update, archival, and delisting of final checklists.

(a) Periodic Reviews: Developers contact NIST at least annually to determine changes in the status of
    checklists. NIST may contact developers, as appropriate, to determine changes in the status of a
    checklist, in which case developers have 30 days to respond and indicate whether checklists should be
    updated, archived, or delisted.

SP 800-70: SECURITY CONFIGURATION CHECKLISTS PROGRAM FOR IT PRODUCTS




(b) Updates: NIST may indicate on the FCL when checklists are under periodic review. Developers
    have 60 days in which to submit the updated material to NIST. Depending on the magnitude of
    updates, NIST may screen the checklist and schedule a public review.

(c) Archival: When a developer no longer provides support for the checklist, at the developer and
    NIST’s discretion, the checklist can remain in the repository but reclassified as an archive. Typical
    reasons would include that the product is no longer supported or is obsolete, or that the developer no
    longer wishes to provide support for the checklist.

(d) Delisting: NIST removes the checklist from the FCL. NIST may send announcements to various e-
    mail lists maintained by NIST or other organizations.

(e) Automatic Delisting: If a final checklist is not reviewed annually, it is removed from the FCL. At
    the developer and NIST’s discretion, it can be reclassified as an archive.

6. Record Keeping

NIST maintains information associated with the program and requires that participants in the checklist
program also maintain certain records, as follows.

(a) NIST Records: During the period that a checklist has been submitted to NIST, and during the period
    that a checklist is listed on the FCL as a final or archived checklist, and for three years thereafter,
    NIST will maintain the following:

         1. The checklist description template, as listed on the repository
         2. The checklist and checklist description, as listed on the repository
         3. All comments submitted as part of the public review
         4. All comments submitted to NIST regarding the checklist.

(b) Developer Records: During the period that a checklist has been submitted to NIST, and during the
    period that a checklist is listed on the FCL as a final or archived checklist, the developer will maintain
    the following:

         1. The checklist description template, as listed on the repository
         2. The checklist and checklist description, as listed on the repository
         3. Test reports and other evidence of checklist testing.
