103   Reports on Computer Systems Technology

104   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
105   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
106   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
107   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
108   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
109   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
110   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
111   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
112   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
113   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
114   and academic organizations.

115   Abstract

116   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
117   identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards
118   outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the enrollment and verification of an
119   identity for use in digital authentication. Central to this is a process known as identity
120   proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP)
121   reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at a
122   useful identity assurance level. This document defines technical requirements for each of
123   three identity assurance levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication
124   (SP) 800-63A.

128   Note to Reviewers

129   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
130   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
131   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines, intends to
132   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
133   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
134   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
135   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
136   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
137   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.

      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


138   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
139   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
140   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
141      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
142         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
143         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
144         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
145         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
146         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
147         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
148         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
149         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
150         recognition.
151      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
152         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
153         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
154         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
155         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
156         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
157         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
158         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
159      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
160         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
161         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
162         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
163         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
164         verifiable credentials.
165      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
166         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
167         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
168         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on Trusted Referees,
169         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
170         confirmation requirements.
171   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
172   topics:
173   Identity Proofing and Enrollment
174       • NIST sees a need for inclusion of an unattended, fully remote Identity Assurance
175         Level (IAL) 2 identity proofing workflow that provides security and convenience,
176         but does not require face recognition. Accordingly, NIST seeks input on the
177         following questions:

                                                   ii
      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


178             – What technologies or methods can be applied to develop a remote, unattended
179               IAL2 identity proofing process that demonstrably mitigates the same risks as
180               the current IAL2 process?
181             – Are these technologies supported by existing or emerging technical standards?
182             – Do these technologies have established metrics and testing methodologies to
183               allow for assessment of performance and understanding of impacts across user
184               populations (e.g., bias in artificial intelligence)?
185      • What methods exist for integrating digital evidence (e.g., Mobile Driver’s Licenses,
186        Verifiable Credentials) into identity proofing at various identity assurance levels?
187      • What are the impacts, benefits, and risks of specifying a set of requirements
188        for CSPs to establish and maintain fraud detection, response, and notification
189        capabilities?
190             – Are there existing fraud checks (e.g., date of death) or fraud prevention
191               techniques (e.g., device fingerprinting) that should be incorporated as baseline
192               normative requirements? If so, at what assurance levels could these be
193               applied?
194             – How might emerging methods such as fraud analytics and risk scoring be
195               further researched, standardized, measured, and integrated into the guidance in
196               the future?
197             – What accompanying privacy and equity considerations should be addressed
198               alongside these methods?
199      • Are current testing programs for liveness detection and presentation attack
200        detection sufficient for evaluating the performance of implementations and
201        technologies?
202      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for identity
203        proofing have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
204   General
205      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
206      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
207        definitions or additional context to any language?
208      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
209      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
210             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
211               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
212               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
213               technologies or processes?

225   Call for Patent Claims

226   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
227   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
228   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
229   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
230   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
231   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
232   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
233   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
234   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
235      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
236         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
237     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
238        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
239        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
240            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
241               discrimination; or
242           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
243               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
244   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
245   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
246   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the

352   1.   Purpose
353   This section is informative.
354   This publication and its companion volumes, [SP800-63], [SP800-63B], and
355   [SP800-63C], provide technical guidelines to organizations for the implementation of
356   digital identity services.
357   This document provides requirements for the identity proofing of individuals at each
358   Identity Assurance Level (IAL) for the purposes of enrolling them into an identity
359   service or providing them access to online resources. It applies to the identity proofing of
360   individuals over a network or in person. Verifying the identities of people calling into a
361   customer support service or a call center is out of scope for this document.

362   2.   Introduction
363   This section is informative.
364   One of the challenges of providing online services is being able to associate a set of
365   activities with a single, specific individual. While there are situations where this is
366   not necessary - such as when anonymity or pseudonymity is desirable - there are other
367   situations where it is important to reliably establish an association with a real-life
368   subject. Examples of this include accessing some government services or executing
369   financial transactions. There are also situations where association with a real-life
370   subject is required by regulations (e.g., the financial industry’s ‘Know Your Customer’
371   requirements) or to establish accountability for high-risk actions (e.g., changing the
372   release rate of water from a dam).
373   This guidance defines identity proofing as the process of establishing, to some degree
374   of certainty or assurance, a relationship between a subject accessing online services and
375   a real-life person. This document provides guidance for Federal Agencies, third-party
376   Credential Service Providers (CSP), and other organizations that provide identity proofing
377   services.
378   The following list states which sections of this document contain normative language
379   and which contain non-normative, informative language. Where needed to help clarify
380   specific requirements, normative sections often include informative explanations. See the
381   “Requirements Notation and Conventions” section of this document for clarification on
382   which statements are normative and which are not.

393   2.1. Expected Outcomes of Identity Prooﬁng
394   The expected outcomes of identity proofing include:
395       • Identity resolution: determine that the claimed identity corresponds to a single,
396         unique individual within the context of the population of users the CSP serves;
397       • Evidence validation: confirm that all supplied evidence is genuine, authentic, and
398         unexpired;
399       • Attribute validation: confirm the accuracy of core attributes;
400       • Identity verification: verify that the claimed identity is associated with the real-life
401         person supplying the identity evidence; and
402       • Fraud Prevention: mitigate attempts to gain fraudulent access to benefits, services,
403         data, or assets.

404   2.2. Identity Assurance Levels
405   Assurance in a subscriber’s identity is described using one of the following Identity
406   Assurance Levels (IAL). Each successive IAL builds on the requirements of lower IALs
407   in order to achieve greater assurance.
408   No identity proofing (IAL0): There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific,
409   real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the subject’s activities are
410   self-asserted and are treated as self-asserted. Self-asserted attributes at IAL0 are neither
411   validated nor verified.
412   IAL1: The identity proofing process supports the real-world existence of the claimed
413   identity. Core attributes are obtained from identity evidence or asserted by the applicant.
414   All core attributes are validated against authoritative or credible sources and steps are
415   taken to link the attributes to the person undergoing the identity proofing process.
416   IAL2: IAL2 adds additional rigor to the identity proofing process by requiring the
417   collection of stronger types of evidence and a more rigorous process for validating the
418   evidence and verifying the identity.
419   IAL3: IAL3 adds the requirement for a trained CSP representative to interact directly
420   with the applicant during the entire identity proofing session, either in person or via a
421   supervised remote identity proofing session.

429   claimed by an applicant. It also provides guidelines on additional aspects of the identity
430   proofing process. These requirements are intended to ensure that the claimed identity
431   exists in the real world and that the applicant is the individual associated with that identity.
432   Collectively, the elements of the identity proofing process are designed to ensure that
433   attacks against a CSP’s identity service that affect a large number of enrolled subscribers
434   require greater time and cost than the value of the data being protected.
435   Additionally, these guidelines provide for multiple methods by which resolution,
436   validation, and verification can be completed as well as multiple types of identity
437   evidence that may support the identity proofing process. To the extent practical, CSPs
438   and organizations SHOULD enable optionality when implementing their identity proofing
439   services and processes to promote access for those with different means, capabilities,
440   and technology access. At a minimum, this SHOULD include accepting multiple types
441   and combinations of identity evidence, supporting multiple data validation sources,
442   enabling multiple methods for verifying identity (e.g., use of trusted referees), multiple
443   channels for engagement (e.g., in-person, remote), and offering assistance mechanisms
444   for applicants (e.g., applicant references).

445   4.1. Identity Prooﬁng and Enrollment
446   This document describes the common pattern in which an applicant undergoes an identity
447   proofing and enrollment process whereby their identity evidence and attributes are
448   collected, uniquely resolved to a single identity within a given population or context, then
449   validated and verified. See [SP800-63] for details on how to choose the most appropriate
450   IAL. A CSP can then bind these attributes to an authenticator (described in [SP800-63B]).
451   The objective of identity proofing is to ensure, to a stated level of certainty, the applicant
452   is who they claim to be. Identity proofing is not conducted to determine suitability or
453   entitlement to benefits. The identity proofing process involves the presentation and
454   validation of the minimum attributes necessary to accomplish identity proofing. There
455   can be many different sets of attributes that suffice as the minimum, so CSPs choose this
456   set by considering applicants’ privacy and the usability, as well as the likely attributes
457   needed in future uses of the digital identity. For example, such attributes, to the extent
458   they are the minimum necessary, could include:
459        1. Full name
460        2. Date of birth
461        3. Home address

462   This document also provides requirements for CSPs collecting additional information
463   used for purposes other than identity proofing.

464   4.1.1. Process Flow
465   This section is informative.
466   Figure 1 outlines the basic flow for identity proofing and enrollment.




                                     Figure 1. Identity Prooﬁng Process

467   The following provides an example of how a CSP and an applicant might interact during a
468   remote identity proofing process at IAL2:
469      1. Resolution
470           a) The CSP collects attributes from the applicant, such as name, address, date of
471              birth, email, and phone number.
472           b) The CSP also collects one or more pieces of identity evidence, such as a
473              driver’s license or a passport.
474      2. Validation
475           a) The CSP validates the attributes obtained in steps 1a by checking them against
476              authoritative or credible sources.
477           b) The CSP validates the authenticity, accuracy, and currency of the presented
478              evidence.
479      3. Verification
480           a) The CSP asks the applicant to take a photo of themself, with liveness checks.
481           b) The CSP compares the pictures on the license and the passport to the photo of
482              the live applicant’s photo from the previous step and determines they match.

      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


483           c) The CSP sends an enrollment code to the validated phone number of the
484              applicant, the applicant provides the enrollment code to the CSP, and the CSP
485              confirms they match, verifying they the applicant is in possession and control
486              of the validated phone number.
487           d) The applicant has been successfully identity proofed and can be enrolled into
488              a subscriber account.

489   4.2. Identity Resolution
490   The goal of identity resolution is to use the smallest set of attributes to uniquely
491   distinguish an individual within a given population or context. While identity resolution
492   is the starting point in the overall identity proofing process, to include the initial detection
493   of potential fraud, it in no way represents a complete and successful identity proofing
494   transaction.

495   4.3. Identity Validation and Identity Evidence Collection
496   The goal of identity validation is to collect the most appropriate identity evidence and
497   attribute information from the applicant and determine it is authentic, accurate, current,
498   and unexpired. Identity validation is made up of three process steps: 1) collecting the
499   appropriate identity evidence; 2) confirming the evidence is authentic; and, 3) confirming
500   key data contained on the identity evidence is valid, current, and related to a real-life
501   subject.
502   Identity evidence collection supports the identity validation process and consists of two
503   steps: 1) presentation of identity evidence by the identity proofing applicant to the CSP
504   and 2) determination by the CSP that the presented evidence is acceptable. Evidence can
505   be presented as a physical document or a copy, photograph, or scan of a document, or
506   as a digital record. The characteristics for acceptable physical (documentary) identity
507   evidence are presented in Sec. 4.3.1 and the characteristics for acceptable digital evidence
508   are provided in Sec. 4.3.2.
509   The CSP SHALL determine the acceptability of presented identity evidence for identity
510   proofing based on the evidence characteristics in this section.
511   The characteristics presented in this section are intended to guide CSPs in determining
512   what is acceptable as identity evidence for the identity proofing process and are not an
513   indication of strength of evidence. Once a CSP determines a particular type of evidence is
514   acceptable, a determination must be made as to its strength, as provided in Sec. 4.3.3.

515   4.3.1. Characteristics of Acceptable Physical Evidence
516   Acceptable physical evidence SHALL contain all of the following characteristics:

517      1. The presented document contains the printed name of the applicant. (See Sec. 10.1
518         - Equity and Resolution - for guidance on dealing with a printed name that varies
519         from the applicant’s claimed identity.)
520      2. The presented document contains at least one printed reference number.
521      3. The presented document contains the printed name of the issuer of the document.
522      4. The issuer of the document performed identity proofing of the applicant prior to
523         issuing the document.
524      5. There is reasonable assurance that the document was delivered to the intended
525         person.

526   4.3.2. Characteristics of Acceptable Digital Evidence
527   Acceptable digital evidence SHALL contain all of the following characteristics:
528      1. The presented digital evidence contains the name of the applicant as the subject
529         of the digital information or account. (See Sec. 10.1 - Equity and Resolution
530         - for guidance on dealing with a name on digital evidence that varies from the
531         applicant’s claimed identity.)
532      2. The presented digital evidence contains at least one reference (e.g., account
533         number) or sufficient attributes to bind the digital information to the applicant.
534      3. The presented digital evidence contains the name of the issuer of the digital
535         information.
536      4. The issuer of the digital evidence performed identity proofing of the applicant prior
537         to issuing the digital evidence.
538      5. There is reasonable assurance that the digital evidence was delivered or made
539         accessible to intended person.
540      6. If applicable, the presented digital evidence can be verified through authentication
541         at an AAL or FAL commensurate with the assessed IAL.

542   4.3.3. Evidence Strength Requirements
543   This section defines the requirements for identity evidence at each strength. Strength of
544   identity evidence is determined by three aspects: 1) the issuing rigor; 2) the ability to
545   provide confidence in validation, including accuracy and integrity of attributes; and 3) the
546   ability to provide confidence in the verification of the applicant presenting the evidence.
547   Evidence at all levels of strength must be current and unexpired.

548   4.3.3.1. Fair Evidence Requirements
549   In order to be considered FAIR, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
550   requirements:
551     1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity through an
552        identity proofing process.
553     2. It can be reasonably assumed that the evidence issuing process would result in the
554        delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates.
555     3. The evidence contains at least one reference number, a facial portrait, or sufficient
556        attributes to uniquely identify the person to whom it relates.
557     4. The evidence has not expired or it expired within the previous six (6) months, or it
558        was issued within the previous six (6) months if it does not contain an expiration
559        date.

560   4.3.3.2. Strong Evidence Requirements
561   In order to be considered STRONG, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
562   requirements:
563     1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity through written
564        procedures designed to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the real-
565        life identity of the person. Such procedures are subject to recurring oversight
566        by regulatory or publicly-accountable institutions. For example, the Customer
567        Identification Program guidelines established in response to the USA PATRIOT
568        Act of 2001 or the [RedFlagsRule], under Sec. 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit
569        Transaction Act of 2003 (FACT Act).
570     2. There is a high likelihood that the evidence issuing process would result in the
571        delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates.
572     3. The evidence contains a reference number or other attributes that uniquely identify
573        the person to whom it relates.
574     4. The evidence contains a facial portrait or other biometric characteristic of the
575        person to whom it relates.
576     5. The evidence includes physical security features that make it difficult to copy or
577        reproduce.
578     6. The evidence includes an expiration date and is unexpired.

579   4.3.3.3. Superior Evidence Requirements
580   In order to be considered SUPERIOR, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
581   requirements:
582      1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by following
583         written procedures designed to enable it to have high confidence that the source
584         knows the real-life identity of the subject. Such procedures are subject to recurring
585         oversight by regulatory or publicly accountable institutions.
586      2. The issuing source visually identified the applicant and performed further checks to
587         confirm the existence of that person.
588      3. The issuing process for the evidence ensured that it was delivered into the
589         possession of the person to whom it relates.
590      4. The evidence contains at least one reference number that uniquely identifies the
591         person to whom it relates.
592      5. The evidence contains a facial portrait or other biometric characteristic of the
593         person to whom it relates.
594      6. The evidence includes digital information that is cryptographically signed.
595      7. The evidence includes physical security features that make it difficult to copy or
596         reproduce.
597      8. The evidence includes an expiration date and is unexpired.

598   4.3.4. Identity Evidence and Attribute Validation
599   The CSP SHALL validate all identity evidence collected to meet evidence collection
600   requirements and all core attribute information required by the CSP identity service.

601   4.3.4.1. Evidence Validation
602   The CSP SHALL validate the authenticity, accuracy, and currency of presented evidence
603   by:
604       • Confirming the evidence is in the correct format and includes complete information
605         for the identity evidence type.
606       • Confirming the evidence is not counterfeit and that it as not been tampered with.
607       • Confirming any security features.
608   The CSP SHALL validate that the evidence is current through confirmation that its
609   expiration date has not passed or that evidence without an expiration date was issued
610   within the previous six (6) months.
611   The authenticity and accuracy of identity evidence or attribute information that is
612   cryptographically protected can be validated through verification of the digital signature

613   on the evidence or the attribute data objects. The CSP SHALL use the public key of
614   the issuing authority of the evidence to verify digitally signed evidence or attribute data
615   objects.

616   4.3.4.2. Attribute Validation
617   All core attributes, whether obtained from identity evidence or applicant self-assertion,
618   must be validated. This subsection provides guidance on acceptable methods for
619   validating evidence and collected attributes.

620   4.3.4.3. Evidence and Attribute Validation Methods
621   Acceptable methods for validating presented evidence include:
622       • Visual and tactile inspection by trained personnel for in-person identity proofing,
623       • Visual inspection by trained personnel for remote identity proofing,
624       • Automated document validation processes using appropriate technologies,
625       • Validation of attributes contained on the evidence with an authoritative or credible
626         source.
627       • Verification of the digital signature protecting digital evidence or attribute data
628         objects using the public key of the issuing authority of the evidence.

629   4.3.4.4. Validation Sources
630   Core attributes that are contained on identity evidence that has been validated according
631   to Sec. 4.3.4.1 can be considered validated, in which case no further validation is
632   required.
633   An authoritative source is an entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of
634   identity attribute information through one or more of the following characteristics. An
635   authoritative source:
636       • Is the original source of the identity attribute(s); or
637       • Is the issuer of identity evidence containing identity attribute information and
638         the issuer confirmed the claimed identity through documented identity proofing
639         processes that are subject to recurring oversight by regulatory or publicly
640         accountable institutions, such as the Customer Identification Program guidelines
641         established under the [PatriotAct]; or
642       • Collected and validated attribute information through an identity proofing process
643         that can confirm the claimed identity through direct interaction with individuals
644         (either in-person or remotely); or
645       • Has access to evidence and attribute information that can be traced to the issuing
646         source of a piece of identity evidence.

647   A credible source is an entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of identity
648   evidence and attribute information through one or more of the following characteristics. A
649   credible source:
650       • Has access to attribute information that was validated through an identity proofing
651         process; or
652       • Has access to attribute information that can be traced to an authoritative source; or
653       • Maintains identity attribute information obtained from multiple sources that is
654         checked for data correlation for accuracy, consistency, and currency.

655   4.4. Identity Veriﬁcation
656   The goal of identity verification is to confirm and establish a linkage between the claimed
657   identity and the real-life existence of the applicant engaged in the identity proofing
658   process.

659   4.4.1. Identity Veriﬁcation Methods
660   The CSP SHALL verify the linkage of the claimed identity to the applicant engaged in
661   the identity proofing process through one or more of the following methods, depending
662   on the IAL identity verification requirements presented in Sec. 5.
663       • Enrollment code verification as specified in Sec. 5.1.6.
664       • In-person physical comparison. The CSP operator and applicant interact in person
665         for the identity proofing event. The CSP operator performs a physical comparison
666         of the facial portrait presented on identity evidence to the face of the applicant
667         engaged in the identity proofing event.
668       • Remote (attended and unattended) physical facial image comparison. The CSP
669         operator performs a physical comparison of the facial portrait presented on identity
670         evidence to the facial image of the applicant engaged in the identity proofing event.
671         The CSP operator may interact directly with the applicant during some or all of the
672         identity proofing event (attended) or may conduct the comparison at a later time
673         (unattended) using a captured video or photograph and the uploaded copy of the
674         evidence. If the comparison is performed at a later time, steps are taken to ensure
675         the captured video or photograph was taken from the live applicant present during
676         the identity proofing event.
677       • Automated biometric comparison. Biometric system comparison may be
678         performed for in-person or remote identity proofing events. The facial portrait,
679         or other biometric characteristic, contained on identity evidence is compared by
680         an automated biometric comparison system to the facial image photograph of the
681         live applicant or other biometric live sample submitted by the applicant during
682         the identity proofing event. The automated biometric comparison system uses a
683         mathematical algorithm for the comparison.

684      • Control of a digital account. An individual is able to demonstrate control of
685        a digital account (e.g., online bank account) or signed digital assertion (e.g.,
686        verifiable credentials) through the use of authentication or federation protocols.
687        This may be done in person through presentation of the credential to a device or
688        reader, but is more likely to be done during remote identity proofing sessions.

690   This section is normative.
691   This section provides requirements for CSPs that operate identity proofing and enrollment
692   services, including requirements for identity proofing at each of the IALs. This section
693   also includes additional requirements for Federal Agencies regardless of whether they
694   operate their own identity service or use an external CSP.

695   5.1. General Requirements
696   The requirements in this section apply to all CSPs performing identity proofing at any
697   IAL.

698   5.1.1. Identity Service Documentation and Records
699   The CSP SHALL conduct its operations according to a practice statement that details
700   all identity proofing processes as they are implemented to achieve the defined IAL. The
701   practice statement SHALL include, at a minimum:
702        1. A complete service description including the particular steps the CSP follows to
703           identity proof applicants at each offered assurance level;
704        2. Types of identity evidence the CSP accepts to meet the evidence strength
705           requirements;
706        3. If applicable, alternative ways for an individual applicant who does not possess the
707           required identity evidence to complete the identity proofing process1 ;
708        4. The attributes the CSP considers to be core attributes. Core attributes include the
709           minimum set of attributes the CSP needs to perform identity resolution as well as
710           any additional attributes the CSP collects and validates for the purposes of identity
711           proofing, fraud mitigation, complying with laws or legal process, or conveying to
712           relying parties (RPs) through attribute assertions;
713        5. The CSP’s policy and process for dealing with identity proofing errors;
714        6. The CSP’s policy and process for identifying and communicating suspected or
715           confirmed fraudulent accounts to RPs and affected individuals;
716        7. The CSP’s policy for managing and communicating service changes (e.g., change
717           in data sources, integrated vendors, or biometric algorithms) to RPs;
718        8. The CSP’s policy for conducting privacy risk assessments, including the timing of
719           its periodic reviews and specific conditions that will trigger an updated privacy risk
720           assessment (see Section 5.1.2);

      1 Options include using a Trusted Referee, with or without an Applicant Representative; see Sec. 5.1.9 for

       supplemental identity evidence types.

721      9. The CSP’s policy for conducting assessments to determine potential equity impacts,
722         including the timing of its periodic reviews and any specific conditions that will
723         trigger an out-of-cycle review (see Section 5.1.3); and

724   5.1.1.1. Ceasing Operations
725      1. The CSP SHALL document its policy and plan for when it ceases its operations.
726      2. This plan SHALL include whether the CSP’s identity service is subject to retention
727         requirements and how it will protect any sensitive data (including identity attributes,
728         and information contained in subscriber accounts and audit logs) during the period
729         of retention.
730      3. At the end of any required retention period, the CSP SHALL be responsible for
731         fully disposing of or destroying all sensitive data.

732   5.1.1.2. Fraud Mitigation Measures
733      1. The CSP SHOULD obtain additional confidence in identity proofing using fraud
734         mitigation measures (e.g., examining the device characteristics of the applicant,
735         evaluating behavioral characteristics, and checking vital statistic repositories such
736         as the Death Master File ([DMF]).
737      2. In the event the CSP uses fraud mitigation measures, the CSP SHALL conduct a
738         privacy risk assessment for these mitigation measures.
739      3. Such assessments SHALL include any privacy risk mitigations (e.g., risk
740         acceptance or transfer, limited retention, use limitations, notice) or other
741         technological mitigations (e.g., cryptography), and be documented per these
742         guidelines.

743   5.1.2. General Privacy Requirements
744   The following privacy requirements apply to all CSPs providing identity services at any
745   IAL.

746   5.1.2.1. Privacy Risk Assessment
747      1. The CSP SHALL conduct and document a privacy risk assessment for the
748         processes used for identity proofing and enrollment.2 At a minimum, the privacy
749         risk assessment SHALL assess the risks associated with:
750            a) Any processing of PII for the purpose of identity proofing and enrollment,
751               including identity attributes, biometrics, images, video, scans, or copies of
752               identity evidence;

753           b) Any additional steps the CSP takes to verify the identity of an applicant
754              beyond the mandatory requirements specified herein;
755           c) Any processing of PII for purposes outside the scope of identity proofing and
756              enrollment except to comply with law or legal process;
757           d) The retention schedule for identity records and PII; and,
758           e) Any PII that is processed by a third party service on behalf of the CSP.
759      2. Based on the results of its privacy risk assessment, the CSP SHALL document the
760         measures it takes to maintain the disassociability, predictability, manageability,
761         confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the PII it processes. In determining
762         such measures, the CSP SHALL consult the NIST Privacy Framework
763         [NIST-Privacy] and NIST Special Publication [SP800-53].
764      3. The CSP SHALL re-assess privacy risks and update its privacy risk assessment any
765         time it makes changes to its identity service that affect the processing of PII.
766      4. The CSP SHALL review its privacy risk assessment periodically, as documented
767         in its practice statement, to ensure it accurately reflects the current risks associated
768         with the processing of PII.
769      5. The CSP SHALL make a summary of its privacy risk assessment available to any
770         organizations that use its services. The summary SHALL be in sufficient detail to
771         enable such organizations to do due dilligence.

772   5.1.2.2. Additional Privacy Protective Measures
773      1. Processing of PII SHALL be limited to the minimum necessary to validate the
774         existence of the claimed identity, associate the claimed identity with the applicant,
775         and provide RPs with attributes they may use to make authorization decisions.
776      2. The CSP MAY collect the Social Security Number (SSN) as an attribute when
777         necessary for identity resolution, in accordance with the privacy requirements in
778         Sec. 5.1.2. Additionally, CSPs SHALL implement privacy protective techniques
779         (e.g., transmitting and accepting derived attribute values rather than full attribute
780         values themselves) to limit the proliferation and retention of SSN data. Knowledge
781         of the SSN SHALL NOT be considered identity evidence.
782      3. At the time of collection, the CSP SHALL provide explicit notice to the applicant
783         regarding the purpose for collecting attributes necessary for identity proofing,
784         including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory to complete the
785         identity proofing process, the specific attributes and other sensitive data that
786         the CSP intends to store in the applicant’s subsequent subscriber account, the
787         consequences for not providing the attributes, and the details of any records
788         retention requirement if one is in place.

789      4. The CSP SHALL provide mechanisms for redress of applicant complaints and for
790         problems arising from the identity proofing. These mechanisms SHALL be easy
791         for applicants to find and use. The CSP SHALL assess the mechanisms for their
792         efficacy in achieving resolution of complaints or problems.

793   5.1.3. General Equity Requirements
794   In support of the goal of improved equity, and as part of its overall risk assessment
795   process, the CSP SHALL assess the elements of its identity service to identify processes
796   or technologies that can possibly result in inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes for
797   members of one group as compared to others. See Sec. 10 for a non-exhaustive list of
798   identity proofing processes and technologies that may be subject to inequitable access or
799   outcomes.
800   Note that executive order 13985 [EO13985], Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
801   Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, requires each federal
802   agency to assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate
803   systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved
804   groups.
805   When assessing the risk of inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes, the following
806   requirements apply:
807      1. Based on the results of its risk assessment, the CSP SHALL document the
808         measures it takes to mitigate the possibility of inequitable access, treatment, or
809         outcomes.
810      2. The CSP SHALL re-assess the risks to equitable access, treatment, or outcomes
811         any time it makes changes to its identity service that affect the processes or
812         technologies.
813      3. The CSP SHALL re-assess the risks to equitable access, treatment, or outcomes
814         periodically to ensure it accurately reflects the current risks associated with its
815         service.
816      4. The CSP SHALL NOT make applicant participation in these risk assessments
817         mandatory.
818      5. The CSP SHALL make the results of its assessment of risks associated with
819         inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes, and any associated mitigations,
820         available to any organizations or individuals that use its service.
821      6. The CSP SHALL also make the results of its assessment publicly available.

822   5.1.4. General Security Requirements
823      1. Each online transaction within the identity proofing process, including transactions
824         that involve third parties, SHALL occur over an authenticated protected channel.
825      2. All PII, in the form of identity attributes, collected as part of the identity proofing
826         process SHALL be protected to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the
827         information.
828      3. The CSP SHALL assess the risks associated with operating its identity service,
829         according to the NIST risk management framework [NIST-RMF], and apply an
830         appropriate baseline security controls.

831   5.1.5. Additional Requirements for Federal Agencies
832   The following requirements apply to federal agencies, regardless of whether they operate
833   their own identity service or use an external CSP as part of their identity service:
834      1. The agency SHALL consult with their Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)
835         to conduct an analysis determining whether the collection of PII, including
836         biometrics, to conduct identity proofing triggers Privacy Act requirements.
837      2. The agency SHALL consult with their SAOP to conduct an analysis determining
838         whether the collection of PII, including biometrics, to conduct identity proofing
839         triggers E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov] requirements.
840      3. The agency SHALL publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) to cover such
841         collection, as applicable.
842      4. The agency SHALL publish a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to cover such
843         collection, as applicable.
844      5. The agency SHALL consult with the senior official, office, or governance body
845         responsible for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) for their
846         agency to determine how the identity proofing service should be designed,
847         resourced, and administered to meet the needs of all served populations.
848      6. The agency SHOULD consult with public affairs and communications
849         professionals within their organization to determine if a communications or public
850         awareness strategy should be developed to accompany the roll-out of any new
851         process, or an update to an existing process, including requirements associated
852         with identity proofing. This may include materials detailing information about how
853         to use the technology associated with the service, a Frequently Asked Questions
854         (FAQs) page, prerequisites to participate in the identity proofing process (such as
855         required evidence), webinars or other live or pre-recorded information sessions,
856         or other media to support adoption and provide applicants with a mechanism to
857         communicate questions, issues, and feedback.

858      7. If the agency uses a third-party CSP, the agency SHALL be responsible for
859         conducting its own privacy risk assessments or doing due diligence before relying
860         on the CSP’s privacy risk assessment as part of its PIA process.
861      8. If the agency uses a third-party CSP, the agency SHALL incorporate the CSP’s
862         assessment of equity risks into its own assessment of equity risks.

863   5.1.6. Requirements for Enrollment Codes
864   Enrollment codes are used to confirm an applicant has access to a validated address. If
865   identity proofing and enrollment are not completed in a single session, an enrollment code
866   can also be used to re-establish an applicant’s binding to their enrollment record for the
867   purposes of completing the enrollment process.
868   The following requirements apply to all CSPs that employ enrollment codes at any IAL:
869      1. Enrollment codes SHALL be sent to a validated address (e.g., postal address,
870         telephone number, or email address).
871      2. The applicant SHALL present a valid enrollment code to complete the identity
872         proofing process.
873      3. Enrollment codes SHALL be comprised of one of the following:
874           a) A random six digit number generated by an approved random number
875              generator with at least 20 bits of entropy;
876           b) A secure link delivered to a uniquely identified address containing an
877              appropriately constructed session ID (at least 64 bits of entropy); or
878           c) A machine readable optical label (such as a QR code) that contains a random
879              secret with at least 20 bits of entropy.
880      4. Enrollment codes SHALL be valid for at most:
881           a) 21 days, when sent to a validated postal address within the contiguous United
882              States;
883           b) 30 days, when sent to a validated postal address outside the contiguous United
884              States;
885           c) 10 minutes, when sent to a validated telephone number (SMS or voice); or
886           d) 24 hours, when sent to a validated email address.

888   5.1.7. Requirements for Notiﬁcations of Identity Prooﬁng
889   Notifications of proofing are sent to the applicant’s validated address notifying them that
890   they have been successfully identity proofed. These notices provide added assurance that
891   the person who underwent identity proofing is the owner of the claimed identity.
892   The following requirements apply to all CSPs that send notifications of proofing as part of
893   their identity proofing processes at any IAL.
894   Notifications of proofing:
895      1. SHALL be sent to a validated address (e.g., postal address, telephone number, or
896         email address) of record. Whenever possible, CSPs SHOULD send notifications of
897         proofing and enrollment codes to different validated addresses.
898      2. SHALL include details about the identity proofing event, such as the name of the
899         identity service and the date the identity proofing was completed.
900      3. SHALL provide clear instructions, including contact information, on actions to take
901         in the case the recipient repudiates the identity proofing event.
902      4. SHOULD provide additional information, such as how the organization or
903         CSP protects the security and privacy of the information it collects and any
904         responsibilities the recipient has as a subscriber of the identity service.

905   5.1.8. Requirements for Use of Biometrics
906   Biometrics is the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and
907   behavioral characteristics such as, but not limited to, fingerprints, iris structures, or
908   facial features that can be used to recognize an individual. As used in these guidelines,
909   biometric data refers to any analog or digital representation of biological and behavioral
910   characteristics at any stage of their capture, storage, or processing. This includes live
911   biometric samples from applicants (e.g., facial images, fingerprint), as well as biometric
912   references obtained from evidence (e.g., facial image on a driver’s license, fingerprint
913   minutiae template on identification cards). As applied to the identity proofing process,
914   CSPs may use biometrics to uniquely resolve an individual identity within a given
915   population or context, verify that an individual is the rightful subject of identity evidence,
916   and/or bind that individual to a new piece of identity evidence or credential.
917   The following requirements apply to CSPs that employ biometric mechanisms as part of
918   their identity proofing process:
919      1. CSPs SHALL provide clear, publicly available information about all uses of
920         biometrics, what biometric data is collected, how it is stored, and information
921         on how to remove biometric information consistent with applicable laws and
922         regulations.
923      2. CSPs SHALL collect an explicit biometric consent from all applicants before
924         collecting biometric information.

925     3. CSPs SHALL store the biometric consent with the subscriber’s account.
926     4. CSPs SHALL have a documented, and publicly available, deletion process and
927        default retention period for all biometric information.
928     5. CSPs SHALL allow individuals to request deletion of their biometric information
929        at any time, except where otherwise restricted by regulation, law, or statute.
930     6. CSPs SHALL have all biometric algorithms tested by an independent entity
931        (e.g., accredited laboratory or research institution) for performance, including
932        performance across demographic groups.
933     7. Testing of all algorithms SHALL be consistent with published ISO/IEC standards
934        for the given modality.
935     8. CSPs SHALL meet the minimum performance thresholds for biometric usage:
936            • False match rate: 1:10,000 or better; and
937            • False non-match rate: 1:100 or better
938     9. CSPs SHALL employ biometric technologies that provide similar performance
939        characteristics for applicants of different demographic groups (racial background,
940        gender, ethnicity, etc.). If performance differences across demographic groups are
941        discovered, CSPs SHALL act expeditiously to provide redress options to affected
942        individuals and to close performance gaps.
943    10. CSPs SHALL make all performance and operational test results publicly available.
944    11. CSPs SHALL assess the performance and demographic impacts of employed
945        biometric technologies in conditions substantially similar to the operational
946        environment and user base of the system. When such assessments include real-
947        world users, participation by users SHALL be voluntary.
948    12. CSPs SHALL make all performance and operational test results publicly available.
949   The following requirements apply to CSPs who collect biometric characteristics from
950   applicants:
951     1. CSP SHALL collect biometrics in such a way that ensures that the biometric is
952        collected from the applicant, and not another subject.
953     2. When collecting and comparing biometrics remotely, the CSP SHALL implement
954        liveness detection capabilities to confirm the genuine presence of a live human
955        being and to mitigate spoofing and impersonation attempts.
956     3. When collecting biometrics in person, the CSP SHALL have the operator view
957        the biometric source (e.g., fingers, face) for presence of non-natural materials and
958        perform such inspections as part of the proofing process.

      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


959   5.1.9. Trusted Referees and Applicant References
960   To increase accessibility and promote equal access to online government services, CSPs
961   provide trusted referees. Trusted referees are used to facilitate the identity proofing
962   and enrollment of individuals who are otherwise unable to meet the requirements for
963   identity proofing to a specific IAL. Examples of such individuals and demographic
964   groups include: individuals who do not possess and cannot obtain the required identity
965   evidence; persons with disabilities; older individuals; persons experiencing homelessness;
966   individuals with little or no access to online services or computing devices; persons
967   without a bank account or with limited credit history; victims of identity theft; individuals
968   displaced or affected by natural disasters; and children under 18.
969   Trusted referees are agents of the CSP or its partners who are trained and authorized to
970   make risk-based decisions to facilitate the identity proofing and enrollment of individuals
971   who are unable to complete the identity proofing process on their own or meet the
972   specified requirements for a given IAL.
973   Additionally, there may be circumstances that encumber or preclude the active
974   participation of an applicant in the identity proofing process. Such circumstances may
975   be due to physical or mental limitations, disabilities, hospitalization, or other temporary or
976   permanent conditions that make active participation in the identity proofing difficult. An
977   applicant reference may vouch for an applicant’s particular circumstances and may also
978   actively assist the applicant in the identity proofing process.
979   Applicant references are individuals who participate in the identity proofing of an
980   applicant in order to assist the applicant in meeting the identity proofing requirements.
981   Such assistance may include vouching for the applicant’s circumstances and actively
982   assisting the applicant in completing the identity proofing process. Applicant references
983   are not agents of the CSP but they would typically work in conjunction with a trusted
984   referee to facilitate the identity proofing and enrollment of an applicant. Since
985   information provided by the applicant reference may be used and relied upon in the
986   identity proofing of the applicant, the applicant reference is identity proofed to the same
987   or higher IAL as the applicant. The role of applicant reference is limited to facilitating
988   the identity proofing process and applicant references are not authorized to represent
989   subscribers in transactions with RPs. Persons who simply provide physical, technical,
990   language translation or other similar assistance to an applicant who is otherwise able to
991   meet the requirements for identity proofing to the specified IAL are not considered to be
992   applicant references and do not require identity proofing.

993   5.1.9.1. Requirements for Trusted Referees
994   CSPs SHALL provide the option for the use of trusted referees for remote identity
995   proofing at IALs 1 and 2.
996   Where trusted referees are offered, the following requirements apply to their use:

997       1. The CSP SHALL establish written policies and procedures for the use of trusted
998          referees as part of its practice statement, as specified in Sec. 5.1.1.
999       2. The CSP SHALL train its trusted referees to make risk-based decisions that allow
1000         applicants to be successfully identity proofed based on their unique circumstances.
1001      3. The CSP SHALL provide notification to the public of the availability of trusted
1002         referee services and how such services are obtained.

1003   5.1.9.2. Requirements for Applicant References
1004   CSPs SHOULD allow the use of applicant references.
1005   The following requirements apply to the use of applicant references at any IAL:
1006      1. The CSP SHALL establish written policies and procedures for the use of applicant
1007         references as part of its practice statement, as specified in Sec. 5.1.1.
1008      2. The CSP SHALL identity proof an applicant reference to the same or higher IAL
1009         intended for the applicant.
1010      3. If the CSP allows for the use of applicant references, it SHALL provide notification
1011         to the public of the allowability of applicant references and any requirements for the
1012         relationship between the reference and the applicant.

1013   5.1.10. Requirements for Interacting with Minors
1014   The following requirements apply to all CSPs providing identity proofing services to
1015   minors at any IAL.
1016      1. The CSP SHALL establish written policy and procedures as part of its practice
1017         statement for identity proofing minors who may not be able to meet the evidence
1018         requirements for a given IAL.
1019      2. When interacting with persons under the age of 13, the CSP SHALL ensure
1020         compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 [COPPA].
1021      3. CSPs SHALL support the use of applicant references when interacting with
1022         individuals under the age or 18.

1023   5.2. Identity Prooﬁng Process
1024   This document provides requirements that apply to several different identity proofing
1025   methods. These possible methods include:
1026       • A fully automated, remote process;
1027       • A CSP operator-assisted remote process;
1028       • A combination of automated and operator-assisted remote process;


                                                   25
       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1029       • An in-person, physical interaction with the applicant process; and
1030       • An IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing process.
1031   Identity proofing at IAL1 and IAL2 allow for any of the these processes to be used, while
1032   IAL3 requires in-person, physical interaction with the applicant or IAL3 Supervised
1033   Remote Identity Proofing.
1034   The following sections provide requirements for identity proofing at each IAL.

1035   5.3. Identity Assurance Level 1
1036   IAL1 permits both remote and in-person identity proofing. Identity proofing processes
1037   at IAL1 allow for a range of acceptable techniques in order to detect the presentation of
1038   fraudulent identities by a malicious actor while facilitating user adoption and minimizing
1039   false negatives and application departures (legitimate applicants who do not successfully
1040   complete identity proofing). Notably, the use of biometric matching, such as the
1041   automated comparison of a facial portrait to supplied evidence, at IAL1 is optional,
1042   providing pathways to proofing and enrollment where such collection may not be viable
1043   or where privacy and equity risks outweigh security considerations.
1044   The following requirements apply to all CSPs providing identity proofing and enrollment
1045   services at IAL1.

1046   5.3.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1047   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1048   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1049   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1050   settings; and traffic analysis.

1051   5.3.2. Evidence and Core Attributes Collection Requirements
1052   5.3.2.1. Evidence Collection
1053   For remote or in-person identity proofing, the CSP SHALL collect one of the following
1054   from the applicant:
1055      1. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence, or
1056      2. One piece of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1057   5.3.2.2. Collection of Additional Attributes
1058   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1059   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1060   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.

1061   5.3.3. Evidence and Core Attributes Validation Requirements
1062   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of SUPERIOR and STRONG
1063   evidence by one of the following:
1064      1. Visual inspection by trained personnel
1065      2. The use of technologies that can confirm the integrity of physical security features
1066         or detect if the evidence is fraudulent or has been inappropriately modified
1067      3. If present, confirming the integrity of digital security features
1068   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of FAIR evidence by visual
1069   inspection by trained personnel.
1070   The CSP SHALL validate all core attributes by both:
1071      1. Validating the accuracy of attributes (such as account or reference number,
1072         name, and date of birth) obtained from pieces of evidence by comparison with
1073         authoritative or credible sources, and
1074      2. Validating the accuracy of self-asserted attributes by comparison with authoritative
1075         or credible sources.
1076   For added assurance, the CSP SHALL evaluate the core attributes, as validated by various
1077   sources, for overall consistency.

1078   5.3.4. Identity Veriﬁcation Requirements
1079   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by one of the
1080   following:
1081      1. Physical comparison of the applicant’s face or biometric comparison of the facial
1082         image of the applicant to the facial portrait included on a piece of SUPERIOR or
1083         STRONG evidence, or
1084      2. Demonstrated association with a digital account through an AAL1 authentication or
1085         an AAL1 and FAL1 federation protocol, or
1086      3. Verification of the applicant’s return of a valid enrollment code Sec. 5.1.6

1087   5.3.5. Notiﬁcation of Prooﬁng Requirement
1088   Upon the successful completion of identity proofing at IAL1, the CSP SHOULD send a
1089   notification of proofing to a validated address for the applicant, as specified in Sec. 5.1.7.

1090   5.4. Identity Assurance Level 2
1091   Like IAL1, IAL2 identity proofing allows for both remote and in-person identity proofing
1092   processes in order to maximize accessibility while still mitigating against impersonation
1093   attacks and other identity proofing errors. Remote IAL2 identity proofing can be
1094   accomplished by the CSP via a fully automated process, a CSP operator attended process,
1095   or a combination of the two.

1096   5.4.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1097   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1098   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1099   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1100   settings; and traffic analysis.

1101   5.4.2. Evidence and Core Attribute Collection Requirements
1102   5.4.2.1. Evidence Collection
1103   For remote or in-person identity proofing, the CSP SHALL collect one of the following
1104   from the applicant:
1105      1. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence
1106      2. One piece of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1107   5.4.2.2. Collection of Attributes
1108   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1109   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1110   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.

1111   5.4.3. Evidence and Core Attributes Validation Requirements
1112   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of SUPERIOR and STRONG
1113   evidence by one of the following:
1114      1. Visual inspection by trained personnel
1115      2. The use of technologies that can confirm the integrity of physical security features
1116         or detect if the evidence is fraudulent or has been inappropriately modified
1117      3. If present, confirming the integrity of digital security features
1118   The CSP SHALL validate all core attributes by:
1119      1. Validating the accuracy of attributes (such as account or reference number,
1120         name, and date of birth) obtained from pieces of evidence by comparison with
1121         authoritative or credible sources, and

1122      2. validating the accuracy of self-asserted attributes by comparison with authoritative
1123         or credible sources
1124   For added assurance, the CSP SHALL evaluate the core attributes, as validated by various
1125   sources, for overall consistency.

1126   5.4.4. Identity Veriﬁcation Requirements
1127   5.4.4.1. Remote Identity Prooﬁng
1128   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by one of the
1129   following:
1130      1. Comparison of a collected biometric characteristic, such as a facial image, to the
1131         associated reference biometric contained on a piece of presented SUPERIOR or
1132         STRONG evidence
1133      2. Demonstrated association with a digital account through an AAL2 authentication or
1134         an AAL2 and FAL2 federation protocol

1135   5.4.4.2. In-person Identity Prooﬁng
1136   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by physical or
1137   biometric comparison of the facial image of the applicant to the facial portrait contained
1138   on a piece of presented SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence.

1139   5.4.5. Notiﬁcation of Prooﬁng Requirement
1140   Upon the successful completion of identity proofing at IAL2, the CSP SHALL send a
1141   notification of proofing to a validated address for the applicant, as specified in Sec. 5.1.7.

1142   5.5. Identity Assurance Level 3
1143   IAL3 adds additional rigor to the steps required at IAL2 and is subject to additional and
1144   specific processes (including the use of biometric information comparison, collection,
1145   and retention) to further protect the identity and RP from impersonation, fraud, or other
1146   significantly harmful damages. In addition, identity proofing at IAL3 is performed in
1147   person (to include supervised remote identity proofing defined in Sec. 5.5.8).

1148   5.5.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1149   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1150   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1151   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1152   settings; and traffic analysis.

1153   5.5.2. Evidence and Core Attributes Collection Requirements
1154   5.5.2.1. Evidence Collection
1155   The CSP SHALL collect evidence from the applicant according to one of the following
1156   options:
1157      1. Two pieces of SUPERIOR evidence, or
1158      2. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence and one piece of STRONG evidence, or
1159      3. Two pieces of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1160   5.5.2.2. Collection of Attributes
1161   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1162   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1163   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.

1164   5.5.3. Validation Requirements
1165   5.5.3.1. Evidence Validation Requirements
1166   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of SUPERIOR evidence by
1167   confirming the integrity of its cryptographic security features and validating any digital
1168   signatures.
1169   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of STRONG evidence by one of
1170   the following:
1171      1. Visual inspection by trained personnel
1172      2. The use of technologies that can confirm the integrity of physical security features
1173         and detect if the evidence is fraudulent or has been inappropriately modified
1174      3. If present, confirming the integrity of digital security features, including the validity
1175         of the issuer’s digital signature

1176   5.5.3.2. Core Attribute Validation Requirements
1177   The CSP SHALL validate all core attributes by both:
1178      1. Validating the accuracy of attributes obtained from pieces of evidence or applicant
1179         self-assertion by comparison with authoritative or credible sources
1180      2. Validating the cryptographic features of any presented digital evidence, as described
1181         above
1182   For added assurance, the CSP SHALL evaluate the core attributes, as validated by various

1184   5.5.4. Identity Veriﬁcation Requirements
1185   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by one of the
1186   following:
1187      1. Comparison of a collected biometric characteristic, such as a facial image, to the
1188         associated reference biometric characteristic contained on a piece of presented
1189         SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence
1190      2. Demonstrated association with a digital account through, at a minimum, an AAL2
1191         authentication or an AAL2 and FAL2 federation protocol

1192   5.5.5. Notiﬁcation of Prooﬁng Requirement
1193   Upon the successful completion of identity proofing at IAL3, the CSP SHALL send a
1194   notification of proofing to a validated address for the applicant, as specified in Sec. 5.1.7.

1195   5.5.6. Biometric Collection
1196   The CSP SHALL collect and record a biometric sample at the time of proofing (e.g.,
1197   facial image, fingerprints) for the purposes of non-repudiation and re-proofing.

1198   5.5.7. In-person Prooﬁng Requirements
1199   In-person proofing at IAL3 SHALL be conducted in one of two ways:
1200       • An in-person interaction between the applicant and a CSP operator, or
1201       • A remote interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator, based on the
1202         requirements in Sec. 5.5.8, IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing.
1203   Regardless of which of the two methods the CSP employs, the following requirements
1204   apply to identity proofing at IAL3:
1205      1. The CSP SHALL have the operator view the biometric source (e.g., fingers, face)
1206         for the presence of any non-natural materials.
1207      2. The CSP SHALL collect biometrics in such a way that ensures that the biometric is
1208         collected from the applicant, and not another subject.

1209   5.5.8. Requirements for IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Prooﬁng
1210   IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing is intended to achieve comparable levels of
1211   confidence and security to an in-person interaction with the applicant.
1212   The following requirements apply to all IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing
1213   sessions:
1214      1. The CSP SHALL monitor the entire identity proofing session, and SHALL ensure
1215         the applicant is continuously present during the entire identity proofing session —
1216         for example, by a continuous high-resolution video transmission of the applicant.

1217      2. The CSP SHALL have a live operator participate remotely with the applicant for
1218         the entirety of the identity proofing session.
1219      3. The CSP SHALL require all actions taken by the applicant during the identity
1220         proofing session to be clearly visible to the remote operator.
1221      4. The CSP SHALL require that all digital verification of evidence (e.g., via chip
1222         or wireless technologies) be performed by integrated scanners and sensors (e.g.,
1223         embedded fingerprint reader).
1224      5. The CSP SHALL require operators to have undergone a training program to detect
1225         potential fraud and to properly perform a supervised remote proofing session.
1226      6. The CSP SHALL employ physical tamper detection and resistance features
1227         appropriate for the environment in which it is located. For example, a kiosk located
1228         in a restricted area or one where it is monitored by a trusted individual requires less
1229         tamper detection than one that is located in a semi-public area such as a shopping
1230         mall concourse.
1231      7. The CSP SHALL ensure that all communications occur over a mutually
1232         authenticated protected channel.

1235   6.   Subscriber Accounts
1236   This section is normative.

1237   6.1. Subscriber Accounts
1238   With the exception of identity proofing for the purposes of providing one-time access
1239   to an online service, or when an applicant declines enrollment into an account, the CSP
1240    SHALL enroll the applicant as a subscriber into its identity service and establish a unique
1241   subscriber account for that subscriber following the successful identity proofing of an
1242   applicant.
1243   The CSP SHALL assign a unique identifier to each subscriber account.
1244   At a minimum the CSP SHALL include the following information in each subscriber
1245   account:
1246        • Unique identifier established for the subscriber
1247        • A record of the identity proofing steps completed for the subscriber in accordance
1248          with Sec. 5.1.1
1249        • Maximum IAL successfully achieved for the identity proofing of the subscriber
1250        • Subscriber consent provided for the processing, retention, or disclosure of any
1251          personal or sensitive information maintained in the subscriber account
1252        • All authenticators currently bound to the subscriber account, whether registered at
1253          enrollment or subsequent to enrollment
1254        • All attributes that were validated during the identity proofing process or in
1255          subsequent transactions to support RP access
1256   The CSP SHALL record information in the subscriber account that was collected during
1257   the identity proofing process or subsequently updated for each subscriber, including:
1258        • Validated identity evidence
1259        • Validated attribute information
1260        • Attribute information that was collected for enrollment in the CSP identity service
1261          that was not validated for identity proofing purposes
1262   The CSP SHALL perform a privacy risk assessment for the processing, retention, or
1263   disclosure of any personal information maintained in the subscriber account in accordance
1264   with Sec. 5.1.2.

1265   6.2. Subscriber Account Access
1266   In order to meet the requirement that accounts containing PII be protected by multi-
1267   factor authentication (MFA), the CSP SHALL provide a way for subscribers to access the
1268   information in their subscriber account through AAL2 or AAL3 authentication processes
1269   using authenticators registered to the subscriber account.
1270   The CSP SHALL provide the capability for subscribers to change or update the personal
1271   information contained in their subscriber account.

1272   6.3. Subscriber Account Lifecycle
1273   6.3.1. Subscriber Account Activity
1274   The CSP SHALL establish and maintain a unique subscriber account for each active
1275   subscriber in the CSP identity system from the time of enrollment to the time of account
1276   closure, as described below. Until the account is closed, the CSP SHALL provide for
1277   the use of the subscriber account, information contained in the account, and registered
1278   authenticators.

1279   6.3.2. Subscriber Account Termination
1280   The CSP SHALL terminate the subscriber account and discontinue its use when one of
1281   the following occur:
1282       • The subscriber elects to terminate their subscriber account with the CSP.
1283       • The CSP determines, following any due notice period and requirements established
1284         by the CSP, that the subscriber account has been compromised.
1285       • The CSP determines, following any due notice period and requirements established
1286         by the CSP, that the subscriber has violated the policies or rules for participation in
1287         the CSP identity service.
1288       • The CSP determines, following any due notice period and requirements established
1289         by the CSP, that the subscriber account is inactive in accordance with the policies or
1290         rules established by the CSP.
1291       • The CSP ceases identity system and services operations.
1292   The CSP SHALL delete any personal or sensitive information from the subscriber
1293   account records following account termination in accordance with the record retention
1294   and disposal requirements.

1295   7.   Threats and Security Considerations
1296   This section is informative.
1297   Effective protection of identity proofing processes requires the layering of security
1298   controls and processes throughout a transaction with a given applicant. To achieve this, it
1299   is necessary to understand where and how threats can arise and compromise enrollments.
1300   There are three general categories of threats to the identity proofing process:
1301        • Impersonation: where an attacker attempts to pose as another, legitimate,
1302          individual (e.g., identity theft)
1303        • False or Fraudulent Representation: where an attacker may create a false identity
1304          or false claims about an identity (e.g., synthetic identity fraud)
1305        • Infrastructure: where attackers may seek to compromise confidentiality,
1306          availability, and integrity of the infrastructure, data, software, or people supporting
1307          the CSPs identity proofing process (e.g., distributed denial of service, insider
1308          threats)
1309   This section focuses on impersonation and false or fraudulent representation threats,
1310   as infrastructure threats are addressed by traditional computer security controls (e.g.,
1311   intrusion protection, record keeping, independent audits) and are outside the scope of this
1312   document. For more information on security controls, see [SP800-53], Recommended
1313   Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.

1320   7.2. Collaboration with Adjacent Programs
1321   Identity proofing services typically serve as the front door for critical business or
1322   service functions. Accordingly, these services should not operate in a vacuum. Close
1323   coordination of identity proofing and CSP functions with cybersecurity teams, threat
1324   intelligence teams, and program integrity teams can enable a more complete protection
1325   of business capabilities while constantly improving identity proofing capabilities.
1326   For example, payment fraud data collected by program integrity teams could provide
1327   indicators of compromised subscriber accounts and potential weaknesses in identity
1328   proofing implementations. Similarly, threat intelligence teams may receive indications of
1329   new tactics, techniques, and procedures that may impact identity proofing processes.
1330   CSPs and RPs should seek to establish consistent mechanisms for the exchange of
1331   information between critical security and fraud stakeholders. Where the CSP is external,
1332   this may be complicated, but should be considered in contractual and legal mechanisms.
1333   All data collected, transmitted, or shared should be minimized and subject to a detailed
1334   privacy and legal assessment.

1343   Collecting unnecessary PII can create confusion regarding why information not being
1344   used for the identity proofing service is being collected. This leads to invasiveness or
1345   overreach concerns, which can lead to loss of applicant trust. Further, PII retention can
1346   become vulnerable to unauthorized access or use. Data minimization reduces the amount
1347   of PII vulnerable to unauthorized access or use, and encourages trust in the identity
1348   proofing process.

1349   8.1.1. Social Security Numbers
1350   These guidelines permit the CSP collection of the SSN as an attribute for use in identity
1351   resolution. However, over-reliance on the SSN can contribute to misuse and place the
1352   applicant at risk of harm, such as through identity theft. Nonetheless, the SSN may
1353   facilitate identity resolution for CSPs, in particular federal agencies that use the SSN
1354   to correlate an applicant to agency records. This document recognizes the role of the SSN
1355   as an attribute and makes appropriate allowance for its use. Knowledge of the SSN is not
1356   sufficient to serve as identity evidence.
1357   Where possible, CSPs and agencies should consider mechanisms to limit the proliferation
1358   and exposure of SSNs during the identity proofing process. This is particularly pertinent
1359   where the SSN is communicated to third party providers during attribute validation
1360   processes. To the extent possible, privacy protective techniques and technologies should
1361   be applied to reduce the risk of an individual’s SSN being exposed, stored, or maintained
1362   by third party systems. Examples of this could be the use of attribute claims (e.g., yes/no
1363   responses from a validator) to confirm the validity of a SSN without requiring it to be
1364   unnecessarily transmitted and stored by the third party. As with all attributes in the
1365   identity proofing process, the value and risk of each attribute being processed is subject
1366   to a privacy risk assessment and for federal agencies the PIA and SORN. The SSN
1367   should only be collected where it is necessary to support resolution associated with the
1368   applications assurance and risk levels.

1369   8.2. Notice and Consent
1370   The guidelines require the CSP to provide explicit notice to the applicant at the time of
1371   collection regarding the purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes

                                                   40
       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1372   necessary for identity proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or
1373   mandatory in order to complete the identity proofing transactions, and the consequences
1374   for not providing the attributes.
1375   An effective notice will take into account user experience design standards and research,
1376   and an assessment of privacy risks that may arise from the collection. Various factors
1377   should be considered, including incorrectly inferring that applicants understand why
1378   attributes are collected, that collected information may be combined with other data
1379   sources, etc. An effective notice is never only a pointer leading to a complex, legalistic
1380   privacy policy or general terms and conditions that applicants are unlikely to read or
1381   understand.

1382   8.3. Use Limitation
1383   The guidelines require CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability
1384   (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and
1385   its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability
1386   for granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective
1387   disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of
1388   attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or
1389   attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process
1390   [NISTIR8062].
1391   CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing
1392   non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes
1393   than those disclosed to a subject can create additional privacy risks. CSPs can determine
1394   appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional
1395   processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be
1396   necessary to get consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services
1397   requested by subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable
1398   assumptions about the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may
1399   carry different privacy risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more
1400   control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber
1401   consent needs to be meaningful; therefore, when CSPs do use consent measures, they
1402   cannot make acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing the
1403   identity service.
1404   Consult your SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls
1405   outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation
1406   measures.

1407   8.4. Redress
1408   The guidelines require the CSP to provide effective mechanisms for redressing applicant
1409   complaints or problems arising from the identity proofing, and make the mechanisms easy

                                                  41
       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1410   for applicants to find and access.
1411   The Privacy Act requires federal CSPs that maintain a system of records to follow
1412   procedures to enable applicants to access and, if incorrect, amend their records. Any
1413   Privacy Act Statement should include a reference to the applicable SORN(s) (see
1414   Sec. 5.1.2), which provide the applicant with instructions on how to make a request for
1415   access or correction. Non-federal CSPs should have comparable procedures, including
1416   contact information for any third parties if they are the source of the information.
1417   CSPs should make the availability of alternative methods for completing the process clear
1418   to applicants (e.g., in person at a customer service center) in the event an applicant is
1419   unable to establish their identity and complete the registration process online.
1420         Note: If the identity proofing process is not successful, CSPs should inform
1421         the applicant of the procedures to address the issue but should not inform the
1422         applicant of the specifics of why the registration failed (e.g., do not inform
1423         the applicant, “Your SSN did not match the one that we have on record for
1424         you”), as doing so could allow fraudulent applicants to gain more knowledge
1425         about the accuracy of the PII.

1426   8.5. Privacy Risk Assessment
1427   The guidelines require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment. In conducting a
1428   privacy risk assessment, CSPs should consider:
1429      1. The likelihood that the action it takes (e.g., additional verification steps or records
1430         retention) could create a problem for the applicant, such as invasiveness or
1431         unauthorized access to the information; and
1432      2. The impact if a problem did occur. CSPs should be able to justify any response it
1433         takes to identified privacy risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk,
1434         and sharing the risk. The use of applicant consent should be considered a form
1435         of sharing the risk, and therefore should only be used when an applicant could
1436         reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept the shared risk.

1437   8.6. Agency-Speciﬁc Privacy Compliance
1438   The guidelines cover specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical
1439   to involve your agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system
1440   development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance
1441   requirements, such as whether or not the PII collection to conduct identity proofing
1442   triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 [PrivacyAct] or the E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov]
1443   requirement to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. For example, with respect to
1444   identity proofing, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and
1445   require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records due to the


                                                    42
       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1446   collection and maintenance of PII or other attributes necessary to conduct identity
1447   proofing.
1448   The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.
1449   These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN
1450   or PIA for identity proofing alone; in many cases it will make the most sense to draft
1451   a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity lifecycle or includes the
1452   identity proofing process as part of a larger, programmatic PIA that discusses the program
1453   or benefit to which the the agency is establishing online access.
1454   Due to the many components of the digital identity lifecycle, it is important for the
1455   SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For
1456   example, other privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using proofing
1457   services such as Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements, etc. The SAOP
1458   can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a
1459   thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable
1460   the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance
1461   processes or by other means.

1462   9.   Usability Considerations
1463   This section is informative.
1464         Note: In this section, the term “users” means “applicants” or “subscribers.”
1465   This section is intended to raise implementers’ awareness of the usability considerations
1466   associated with enrollment and identity proofing (for usability considerations for typical
1467   authenticator usage and intermittent events, see [SP800-63B] Sec. 10.
1468   [ISO/IEC9241-11] defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product, or service
1469   can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency
1470   and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals,
1471   and context of use as the necessary elements for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and
1472   satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve
1473   usability.
1474   The overarching goal of usability for enrollment and identity proofing is to promote a
1475   smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimizing user burden (e.g., time and
1476   frustration) and enrollment friction (e.g., the number of steps to complete and amount
1477   of information to track). To achieve this goal, organizations have to first familiarize
1478   themselves with their users.
1479   The enrollment and identity proofing process sets the stage for a user’s interactions with a
1480   given CSP and the online services that the user will access; as negative first impressions
1481   can influence user perception of subsequent interactions, organizations need to promote a
1482   positive user experience throughout the process.
1483   Usability cannot be achieved in a piecemeal manner. Performing a usability evaluation on
1484   the enrollment and identity proofing process is critical. It is important to conduct usability
1485   evaluation with representative users, realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of
1486   use. The enrollment and identity proofing process should be designed and implemented
1487   so it is easy for users to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover
1488   when the wrong thing happens.
1489   From the user’s perspective, the three main steps of enrollment and identity proofing are
1490   pre-enrollment preparation, the enrollment and proofing session, and post-enrollment
1491   actions. These steps may occur in a single session or there could be significant time
1492   elapsed between each one (e.g., days or weeks).
1493   General and step-specific usability considerations are described in sub-sections below.
1494   Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.
1495   Accessibility differs from usability and is out of scope for this document. [Section508]
1496   was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require federal agencies
1497   to make their electronic and information technology public content accessible to people
1498   with disabilities. Refer to Section 508 law and standards for accessibility guidance.

1499   9.1. General User Considerations During Enrollment and Identity Prooﬁng
1500   This sub-section provides usability considerations that are applicable across all steps of
1501   the enrollment process. Usability considerations specific to each step are detailed in Secs.
1502   9.2 to 9.4.
1503       • To avoid user frustration, streamline the process required for enrollment to make
1504         each step as clear and easy as possible.
1505       • Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example,
1506         provide helpful information such as a link to online self-service feature, chat
1507         sessions, and a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, sufficient information
1508         should be provided to enable users to answer their own enrollment preparation
1509         questions without outside intervention.
1510       • Clearly explain who is collecting their data and why. Also indicate the path their
1511         data will take, in particular where the data is being stored.
1512       • Ensure all information presented is usable.
1513            – Follow good information design practice for all user-facing materials (e.g.,
1514              data collection notices and fillable forms).
1515            – Write materials in plain language and avoid technical jargon. If appropriate,
1516              tailor language to the literacy level of the intended population. Use active
1517              voice and conversational style, logically sequence main points, use the same
1518              word consistently rather than synonyms to avoid confusion, and use bullets,
1519              numbers, and formatting where appropriate to aid readability.
1520            – Consider text legibility, such as font style, size, color, and contrast with
1521              surrounding background. The highest contrast is black on white. Text
1522              legibility is important because users have different levels of visual acuity.
1523              Illegible text will contribute to user comprehension errors or user entry errors
1524              (e.g., when completing fillable forms). Use sans serif font styles for electronic
1525              materials and serif fonts for paper materials. When possible, avoid fonts that
1526              do not clearly distinguish between easily confusable characters (such as the
1527              letter “O” and the number “0”). This is especially important for enrollment
1528              codes. Use a minimum font size of 12 points, as long as the text fits the
1529              display.
1530       • Perform a usability evaluation for each step with representative users. Establish
1531         realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use for the usability evaluation.

1532   9.2. Pre-Enrollment Preparation
1533   This section describes an effective approach to facilitate sufficient pre-enrollment
1534   preparation so users can avoid challenging, frustrating enrollment sessions. Ensuring

       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1535   users are as prepared as possible for their enrollment sessions is critical to the overall
1536   success and usability of the enrollment and identity proofing process.
1537   Such preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., required
1538   documentation) in a usable format in an appropriate timeframe. This includes making
1539   users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know
1540   anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is scored as “fair,” “strong,”
1541   or “superior,” whereas organizations need to know what IAL is required for access to a
1542   particular system.
1543   To ensure users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with
1544   the enrollment process, and what will be needed for their session, provide users:
1545       • Information about the entire process, such as what to expect in each step.
1546            – Clear explanations of the expected timeframes to allow users to plan
1547              accordingly.
1548       • Explanation of the need for — and benefits of — identity proofing to allow users to
1549         understand the value proposition.
1550       • Information on the monetary amount and acceptable forms of payment, and if
1551         there is an enrollment fee. Offering a larger variety of acceptable forms of payment
1552         allows users to choose their preferred payment operation.
1553       • Information on whether the user’s enrollment session will be in-person or in-person
1554         over remote channels, and whether a user can choose. Only provide information
1555         relevant to the allowable session option(s).
1556            – Information on the location(s), whether a user can choose their preferred
1557              location, and necessary logistical information for in-person or in-person over
1558              remote channels session. Note that users may be reluctant to bring identity
1559              evidence to certain public places (bank versus supermarket), as it increases
1560              exposure to loss or theft.
1561            – Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet
1562              access) for remote sessions.
1563            – An option to set an appointment for in-person or in-person over remote
1564              channels identity proofing sessions to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are
1565              allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an
1566              appointment.
1567                 * Provide clear instructions for setting up an enrollment session
1568                   appointment, reminders, and how to reschedule existing appointments.
1569                 * Offer appointment reminders and allow users to specify their preferred
1570                   appointment reminder format(s) (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text
1571                   message). Users need information such as date, time, location, and a
1572                   description of required identity evidence.

1573       • Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether
1574         each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the
1575         complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of
1576         identity evidence, including requirements specific to a piece of identity evidence
1577         (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to
1578         potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.
1579            – Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary
1580              identity evidence.
1581            – Inform users of any special requirements for minors and people with unique
1582              needs. For example, provide users with the information on whether applicant
1583              reference and/or trusted referee processes are available and information
1584              necessary to use those processes (see Sec. 5.1.9).
1585            – If forms are required:
1586                * Provide fillable forms before and at the enrollment session. Do not
1587                  require users to have access to a printer.
1588                * Minimize the amount of information users must enter on a form, as users
1589                  are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms. Where
1590                  possible, pre-populate forms.

1591   9.3. Enrollment and Prooﬁng Session
1592   Usability considerations specific to the enrollment session include:
1593       • At the start of the identity proofing session, remind users of the procedure. Do
1594         not expect them to remember the procedures described during the pre-enrollment
1595         preparation step. If the enrollment session does not immediately follow pre-
1596         enrollment preparation, it is especially important to clearly remind users of the
1597         typical timeframe to complete the proofing and enrollment phase.
1598       • Provide rescheduling options for in-person or in-person over remote channels.
1599       • Provide a checklist with the allowed and required identity evidence to ensure
1600         users have the requisite identity evidence to proceed with the enrollment session,
1601         including enrollment codes, if applicable. If users do not have the complete set of
1602         identity evidence, they must be informed regarding whether they can complete a
1603         partial identity proofing session.
1604       • Notify users regarding what information will be destroyed, what, if any, information
1605         will be retained for future follow-up sessions, and what identity evidence they will
1606         need to bring to complete a future session. Ideally, users can choose whether they
1607         would like to complete a partial identity proofing session.

       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                               Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1608      • Set user expectations regarding the outcome of the enrollment session as prior
1609        identity verification experiences may drive their expectations (e.g., receiving a
1610        driver’s license in person, receiving a passport in the mail).
1611      • Clearly indicate whether users will receive an authenticator immediately at the end
1612        of a successful enrollment session, if users have to schedule an appointment to pick
1613        it up in person, or if users will receive it in the mail and when they can expect to
1614        receive it.
1615      • During the enrollment session, there are several requirements to provide users with
1616        explicit notice at the time of identity proofing, such as what data will be retained on
1617        record by the CSP (see Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 8 for detailed requirements on notices). If
1618        CSPs seek consent from a user for additional attributes or uses of their attributes for
1619        any purpose other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization or attribute
1620        assertions, per 4.2 requirement (5), make CSPs aware that requesting additional
1621        attributes or uses may be unexpected or may make users uncomfortable. If users
1622        do not perceive benefit(s) to the additional collection or uses, but perceive extra
1623        risk, they may be unwilling or hesitant to provide consent or continue the process.
1624        Provide users with explicit notice of the additional requirements.
1625      • If an enrollment code is issued:
1626           – Notify users in advance that they will receive an enrollment code, when to
1627             expect it, the length of time for which the code is valid, and how it will arrive
1628             (e.g., physical mail, SMS, landline telephone, email, or physical mailing
1629             address).
1630           – When an enrollment code is delivered to a user, include instructions on how
1631             to use the code, and the length of time for which the code is valid. This
1632             is especially important given the short validity timeframes specified in
1633             Sec. 5.1.6.
1634           – If issuing a machine-readable optical label, such as a QR Code (see
1635             Sec. 5.1.6), provide users with information on how to obtain QR code
1636             scanning capabilities (e.g., acceptable QR code applications).
1637           – Inform users that they will be required to repeat the enrollment process if
1638             enrollment codes expire or are lost before use.
1639           – Provide users with alternative options as not all users are able to access and
1640             use technology equitably. For example, users may not have the technology
1641             needed for this approach to be feasible.
1642      • At the end of the enrollment session,
1643           – If enrollment is successful, send users confirmation regarding the successful
1644             enrollment and information on next steps (e.g., when and where to pick up
1645             their authenticator, when it will arrive in the mail).

       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1646           – If enrollment is partially complete (due to users not having the complete set
1647             of identity evidence, users choosing to stop the process, or session timeouts),
1648             communicate to users:
1649               * what information will be destroyed;
1650               * what, if any, information will be retained for future follow-up sessions;
1651               * how long the information will be retained; and
1652               * what identity evidence they will need to bring to a future session.
1653           – If enrollment is unsuccessful, provide users with clear instructions for
1654             alternative enrollment session types, for example, offering in-person proofing
1655             for users that can not complete remote proofing.
1656      • If users receive the authenticator during the enrollment session, provide users
1657        information on the use and maintenance of the authenticator. For example,
1658        information could include instructions for use (especially if there are different
1659        requirements for first-time use or initialization), information on authenticator
1660        expiration, how to protect the authenticator, and what to do if the authenticator
1661        is lost or stolen.
1662      • For both in-person and remote identity proofing, additional usability considerations
1663        apply:
1664           – At the start of the enrollment session, operators or attendants need to explain
1665             their role to users (e.g., whether operators or attendants will walk users
1666             through the enrollment session or observe silently and only interact as
1667             needed).
1668           – At the start of the enrollment session, inform users that they must not depart
1669             during the session, and that their actions must be visible throughout the
1670             session.
1671           – When biometrics are collected during the enrollment session, provide users
1672             clear instructions on how to complete the collection process. The instructions
1673             are best given just prior to the process. Verbal instructions with corrective
1674             feedback from a live operator are the most effective (e.g., instruct users where
1675             the biometric sensor is, when to start, how to interact with the sensor, and
1676             when the biometric collection is completed).
1677      • Since remote identity proofing is conducted online, follow general web usability
1678        principles. For example:
1679           – Design the user interface to walk users through the enrollment process.
1680           – Reduce users’ memory load.
1681           – Make the interface consistent.

       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1682            – Clearly label sequential steps.
1683            – Make the starting point clear.
1684            – Design to support multiple platforms and device sizes.
1685            – Make the navigation consistent, easy to find, and easy to follow.

1686   9.4. Post-Enrollment
1687   Post-enrollment refers to the step immediately after enrollment but prior to typical usage
1688   of an authenticator (for usability considerations for typical authenticator usage and
1689   intermittent events, see [SP800-63B], Sec. 10. As described above, users have already
1690   been informed at the end of their enrollment session regarding the expected delivery (or
1691   pick-up) mechanism by which they will receive their authenticator.
1692   Usability considerations for post-enrollment include:
1693       • Minimize the amount of time that users wait for their authenticator to arrive.
1694         Shorter wait times will allow users to access information systems and services
1695         more quickly.
1696       • Inform users whether they need to go to a physical location to pick up their
1697         authenticators. The previously identified usability considerations for appointments
1698         and reminders still apply.
1699       • Along with the authenticator, give users information relevant to the use and
1700         maintenance of the authenticator; this may include instructions for use, especially
1701         if there are different requirements for first-time use or initialization, information on
1702         authenticator expiration, and what to do if the authenticator is lost or stolen.

1703   10.   Equity Considerations
1704   This section is informative.
1705   This section is intended to provide guidance to CSPs for assessing the risks associated
1706   with inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes for individuals using its identity services,
1707   as required in Sec. 5.1.3. It provides a non-exhaustive list of potential areas in the identity
1708   proofing process that may be subject to inequities, as well as possible mitigations that can
1709   be applied. CSPs can use this section as a starting point for considering where the risks
1710   for inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes exist within its identity service. It is not
1711   intended that the below guidance be considered a definitive, all-inclusive list of associated
1712   equity risks to identity services.
1713   In assessing equity risks, a CSP starts by considering the overall user population served
1714   by its identity proofing and enrollment service. Additionally, the CSP further identifies
1715   groups of users within the population whose shared characteristic(s) can cause them to
1716   be subject to inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes when using that service. CSPs
1717   are encouraged to assess the effectiveness of any mitigations by evaluating their impacts
1718   on the affected user group(s). The usability considerations provided in Sec. 9 should also
1719   be considered when applying equity risk mitigations to help improve the overall usability
1720   and equity for all persons using an identity service.

1721   10.1. Equity and Identity Resolution
1722   Identity resolution involves collecting the minimum set of attributes to be able to
1723   distinguish the claimed identity as a single, unique individual within the population
1724   served by the identity service. Attributes are obtained from presented identity evidence,
1725   applicant self-assertion, and/or back-end attribute providers.
1726   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1727   access, treatment, or outcomes associated with the identity resolution process:
1728   Description: The identity service design requires an applicant to enter their name
1729   using a Western name format (e.g., first name, last name, optional middle name).
1730   Possible mitigations include:
1731      1. Analyzing possible name configurations and determine how all names can be
1732         accurately accommodated using the name fields
1733      2. Providing easy-to-find and use guidance to users on how to enter all names using
1734         the name fields
1735   Description: The identity service cannot accommodate applicants whose name,
1736   gender, or other attributes have changed and are not consistently reflected on the
1737   presented identity evidence or match what is in the attribute verifier’s records.
1738   Possible mitigations include:

                                                     51
       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines

1739      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1740         on the specific applicant circumstances
1741      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1742         difference in attributes

1743   10.2. Equity and Identity Validation
1744   Identity evidence and core attribute validation involves confirming the genuineness,
1745   currency, and accuracy of presented identity evidence and the accuracy of any additional
1746   attributes. These outcomes are accomplished by comparison of the evidence and attributes
1747   against data held by authoritative or credible sources. When considered together with the
1748   identity resolution phase, the result of successful validation phase is the confirmation, to
1749   some level of confidence, that the claimed identity exists in the real world.
1750   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1751   access, treatment, or outcomes associated with the evidence and attribute validation
1752   process:
1753   Description: Certain user groups do not possess the necessary minimum evidence to
1754   meet the requirements of a given IAL.
1755   Possible mitigations include:
1756      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1757         on the specific applicant circumstances
1758      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1759         applicant
1760   Description: Records held by authoritative and credible sources (e.g., mobile
1761   network operators and phone number verifiers) are insufficient to support the
1762   validation of core attributes or presented evidence for applicants belonging to
1763   certain user groups.
1764   Possible mitigations include:
1765      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1766         on the specific applicant circumstances
1767      2. Employing alternative authoritative or credible sources
1768   Description: Records held by authoritative and credible sources may include
1769   inaccurate or false information about persons who are the victims of identity fraud.
1770   Possible mitigations include:
1771      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1772         on the specific applicant circumstances
1773      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2) who can vouch for the
1774         difference in attributes

1775   10.3. Equity and Identity Veriﬁcation
1776   Identity verification involves proving the binding between the applicant undergoing the
1777   identity proofing process and the validated, real-world identity established through the
1778   identity resolution and validation steps. It most often involves collecting a picture (facial
1779   image capture) of the applicant taken during the identity proofing event and comparing it
1780   a photograph contained on a presented and validated piece of identity evidence.
1781   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1782   treatment or outcomes associated with the identity verification phase:
1783   Description: Image capture technologies lack the ability to capture certain skin
1784   tones or facial features of sufficient quality to perform a comparison.
1785   Possible mitigations include:
1786      1. Employing robust image capture technologies that are able to accommodate
1787         different skin tones, facial features, and lighting situations
1788      2. Conducting operational testing to determine if the image capture technologies have
1789         introduced unintentional biases
1790      3. Providing risk-based alternative processes that compensate for residual bias and
1791         technological limitations
1792   Description: Facial coverings worn for religious purposes impede the ability to
1793   capture a facial image of an applicant.
1794   Possible mitigations include:
1795      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1796         on the specific applicant circumstances.
1797      2. Providing alternative ways to accomplish identity verification, such as an in-person
1798         proofing.
1799   Description: When using 1:1 facial image comparison technologies, biased facial
1800   comparison algorithms may result in false non-matches.
1801   Possible mitigations include:
1802      1. Using algorithms that are independently tested for consistent performance across
1803         demographic groups and image types
1804      2. Supporting alternative processes to compensate for residual bias and technological
1805         limitations
1806      3. Conducting ongoing quality monitoring and operational testing to identify
1807         performance variances are identified across demographic groups and implementing
1808         corrective actions as needed (e.g., updated algorithms, machine learning, etc.)

1809   Description: When employing physical facial image comparison performed by CSP
1810   operators, human biases and inconsistencies in making facial comparisons may
1811   result in false non-matches.
1812   Possible mitigations include:
1813      1. Defining policy and procedures aimed at reducing/eliminating the inequitable
1814         treatment of applicants by CSP operators/agents
1815      2. Rigorously training and certifying of operators
1816      3. Conducting ongoing quality monitoring and taking corrective actions when biases,
1817         or inequitable treatments or outcomes, are identified

1818   10.4. Equity and User Experience
1819   The Usability Considerations section of this document (Sec. 9) provides CSPs with
1820   guidance on how to provide applicants with a smooth, positive identity proofing
1821   experience. In addition to the specific considerations provided in Sec. 9, this section
1822   provides CSPs with additional considerations when considering the equity of their user
1823   experience.
1824   Description: Lack of access to needed technology (e.g. connected mobile device or
1825   computer), or difficulties in using required technologies, unduly burdens some user
1826   groups.
1827   Possible mitigations include:
1828      1. Allowing the use of helpers who assist applicants, who are otherwise able to meet
1829         the identity proofing requirements, in the use of the required technologies and
1830         activities
1831      2. Allowing the use of publicly-available devices (e.g., computers or tablets) and
1832         providing online help resources for completing the identity proofing process on a
1833         non-applicant-owned computer or device
1834      3. Providing in-person proofing options
1835   Description: The remote or in-person identity proofing process presents challenges
1836   for persons with disabilities.
1837   Possible mitigations for remote identity proofing include:
1838      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who are trained to communicate and
1839         assist people with a variety of needs or disabilities (e.g., fluent in sign language)
1840      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2)
1841      3. Supporting the use of accessibility and other technologies, such as audible
1842         instructions, screen readers and voice recognition technologies

1843   Possible mitigations for in-person identity proofing include:
1844      1. Providing trained operators who are trained to communicate and assist people with
1845         a variety of needs or disabilities (e.g., fluent in sign language)
1846      2. Choosing equipment and workstations that can be adjusted to different heights and
1847         angles
1848      3. Selecting locations that are convenient and comply with ADA accessibility
1849         guidelines
