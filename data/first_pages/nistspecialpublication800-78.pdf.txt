1.    Introduction

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 mandated the creation of new
standards for interoperable identity credentials for physical and logical access to Federal
government locations and systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201),
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to
establish standards for identity credentials [FIPS201]. This document, Special Publication 800-
78 (SP 800-78), specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems and is a
companion document to FIPS 201.

1.1 Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This recommendation is
consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-
130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV:
Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-
governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this
document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding
on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this
recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary
of Commerce, Director of OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2 Purpose

FIPS 201 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing,
registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also defines the structure of an
identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical
specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201
as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201 and the related Special Publications
800-73 (SP 800-73), Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and the forthcoming SP 800-
76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification, [SP800-76] that rely on
cryptographic functions.

1.3 Scope

The scope of this recommendation encompasses the PIV Card, infrastructure components that
support issuance and management of the PIV Card, and applications that rely on the credentials
supported by the PIV Card to provide security services. The recommendation identifies


                                                                                  Page 1
Special Publication 800-78                    Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


acceptable symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, and
message digest algorithms, and specifies mechanisms to identify the algorithms associated with
PIV keys or digital signatures.

Algorithms and key sizes have been selected for consistency with applicable Federal standards
and to ensure adequate cryptographic strength for PIV applications. All cryptographic
algorithms employed in this specification provide at least 80 bits of security strength. For
detailed guidance on the strength of cryptographic algorithms, see the forthcoming [SP800-57],
Recommendation on Key Management.

1.4 Audience and Assumptions

2.       Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201

FIPS 201 employs cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate cardholders, secure information
stored on the PIV Card, and secure the supporting infrastructure.

FIPS 201 and its supporting documents specify a suite of keys to be stored on the PIV Card for
personal identity verification, digital signature generation, and key management. The PIV
cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201 are:

     +    The asymmetric PIV authentication key;
     +    A card authentication key, which may be symmetric or asymmetric;
     +    An asymmetric digital signature key for signing documents and messages; and
     +    An asymmetric key management key, supporting key establishment or key transport.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used for these keys are
specified in Section 3.1. PIV Cards must implement private key computations for one or more
of the algorithms identified in this section.

Cryptographically protected objects specified in FIPS 201, SP 800-73, and the forthcoming SP
800-76 include:

     +    The X.509 certificates for each asymmetric key on the PIV Card;
     +    A digitally signed Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID);
     +    Digitally signed biometrics using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
          (CBEFF) signature block; and
     +    The SP 800-73 Security Object, which is a digitally signed hash table. [SP800-73]
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to protect these
objects are specified in Section 3.2. Certificate Authorities (CAs) and card management systems
that protect these objects must support one or more of the cryptographic algorithms, key sizes,
and parameters specified in Section 3.2.

Applications may be designed to use any or all of the cryptographic keys and objects stored on
the PIV Card to authenticate cardholders. Where maximum interoperability is required,
applications should support all of the identified algorithms, key sizes, and parameters specified
in Section 3.2.

FIPS 201 requires CAs and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders to generate
and distribute digitally signed Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and OCSP status messages.
These revocation mechanisms support validation of the PIV Card, the PIV cardholder, the
cardholder’s digital signature key, and the cardholder’s key management key.




                                                                                  Page 3
Special Publication 800-78                    Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


The signed revocation mechanisms specified in FIPS 201 are:

   +   X.509 CRLs that specify the status of a group of X.509 certificates; and
   +   OCSP status response messages that specify the status of a particular X.509 certificate.
The cryptographic algorithms and key sizes, and parameters that may be used to sign these
mechanisms are specified in Section 4. Section 4 also describes rules for encoding the signatures
to ensure interoperability.

FIPS 201 permits optional card management operations. These operations may only be
performed after the PIV Card authenticates the card management system. Card management
systems are authenticated through the use of card management keys. The cryptographic
algorithms and key sizes that may be used for these keys are specified in Section 5.




                                                                                  Page 4

3.       On Card Cryptographic Requirements

FIPS 201 identifies a suite of objects that are stored on the PIV Card for use in authentication
mechanisms or in other security protocols. These objects may be divided into three classes:
cryptographic keys, signed authentication information stored on the PIV Card, and message
digests of information stored on the PIV Card. Cryptographic requirements for PIV keys are
detailed in Section 3.1. Cryptographic requirements for other stored objects are detailed in
Section 3.2.

3.1 PIV Cryptographic Keys

FIPS 201 specifies four different classes of cryptographic keys to be used as credentials by the
PIV cardholder:

     +    The mandatory PIV authentication key;
     +    An optional card authentication key;
     +    An optional digital signature key; and
     +    An optional key management key.
Table 3-1 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for each
key type. Table 3-1 also specifies two time periods with different sets of acceptable algorithms
for each key type. Note that digital signature and key management keys must transition to larger
key sizes by 2008, while authentication keys must transition by 2010. This requirement
anticipates that digital signature and key management keys will be used to protect data for longer
periods of time, while data enciphered with authentication is generally not retained, and should
not include private or secret information.

In addition to the key sizes, keys must be generated using secure parameters. Rivest, Shamir,
Adleman (RSA) keys must be generated using appropriate exponents, as specified in Table 3-2.
Elliptic curve keys must correspond to one of the following recommended curves from
[FIPS186-3]:

     +    Curve P-224;
     +    Curve K-233;
     +    Curve B-233;
     +    Curve P-256;
     +    Curve K-283; or
     +    Curve B-283.
A PIV Card that supports elliptic curve cryptography must support private key computations for
one or more of the listed curves. Applications that rely upon the PIV Card to authenticate users
may select which curves to implement based on the community of users.



                                                                                  Page 5
Special Publication 800-78                             Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV


Note that the NIST recommended curves of 163 and 192 bits in [FIPS186-3] are not supported
by this specification. While these curves have equivalent strength with 1024 bit RSA, FIPS 201
implementations supporting elliptic curve should implement algorithms that will still be secure
after 2010.1

                                                      283 bits)


This specification also restricts the size of the RSA exponent. Implementations of this
specification must choose an exponent greater than or equal to 65,357. Upper bounds for the
exponent are based on key length; see Table 3-2 for complete details.

Note that SP 800-73 specifies mechanisms that indicate the algorithm and key size for
asymmetric private keys and symmetric secret keys stored on the PIV Card. For elliptic curve
keys, these mechanisms also indicate which curve is associated with the private key. The
mechanisms specified in SP 800-73 must be used to indicate the algorithm associated with
private and secret keys stored on the PIV Card.

 Note that 1024 bit RSA is permitted to leverage current products and promote efficient adoption of FIPS 201, but
must be phased out by 2010 for authentication keys and 2008 for digital signatures and key management.

This specification requires that the Key Management key must be an RSA key transport key, an
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key, or an elliptic curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV)
key. The specification for RSA key transport is [PKCS1]; the specification for ECDH and
elliptic curve MQV is the forthcoming [SP800-57].

3.2 Authentication Information Stored on the PIV Card

3.2.1   Specification of Digital Signatures on Authentication Information

FIPS 201 requires the use of digital signatures to protect the integrity and authenticity of
information stored on the card. FIPS 201 and SP 800-73 require digital signatures on the
following objects stored on the PIV Card:

   +    The CHUID;
   +    Biometric information (e.g., fingerprints);
   +    the SP 800-73 Security Object; and
   +    X.509 public key certificates.
Table 3-3 provides specific guidance for digitally signed information stored on the PIV Card.
The first column specifies two time periods; the remaining columns specify public key
algorithms and hash algorithms for generating digital signatures. For signatures on the CHUID,
800-73 Security Object, and stored biometrics, the size of the public key and the hash algorithm
that must be used to generate the signature is determined by the expiration date of the PIV Card.
For X.509 certificates stored on the card, the size of the public key and the hash algorithm used
to generate the signature is determined by the expiration date associated with the certificate.
Agencies are cautioned that generating digital signatures with SHA-224 and SHA-256 may
initially limit interoperability.

FIPS 201, SP 800-73, and the forthcoming SP 800-76 specify formats for the CHUID, the
Security Object, the biometric information, and X.509 public key certificates which rely on
object identifiers (OID) to specify which signature algorithm was used to generate the digital
signature. The object identifiers specified in Table 3-4, below, must be used in FIPS 201
implementations to identify the signature algorithm. Note that RSA digital signatures may be
generated using either the PKCS #1 v.1.5 padding scheme or the Probabilistic Signature Scheme
(PSS) padding. Most current implementations of RSA use the padding scheme defined in PKCS
#1 v.1.5. The PSS padding scheme OID is independent of the hash algorithm; the hash
algorithm is specified as a parameter (for details, see [PKCS1]). Implementations of this
specification must use the SHA-256 hash algorithm when generating RSA-PSS signatures.
Agencies may wish to transition to the PSS padding scheme as they transition to SHA-256.

3.2.2    Specification of Public Keys In X.509 Certificates

FIPS 201 requires generation and storage of an X.509 certificate to correspond with each
asymmetric private key contained on the PIV Card. X.509 certificates include object identifiers
to specify the cryptographic algorithm associated with a public key. Table 3-5, below, specifies
the object identifiers that may be used in certificates to indicate the algorithm for a subject public
key. Note that symmetric key algorithms are omitted from this table; in these cases there is no
need for an X.509 certificate.



                                                                                         Page 8

additional object identifier must be supplied in a parameters field to indicate the elliptic curve
associated with the key.2 Table 3-6 below identifies the named curves and associated OIDs.
(RSA exponents are encoded with the modulus in the certificate’s subject public key, so the OID
is not affected.)

3.2.3    Specification of Message Digests in the SP 800-73 Security Object

SP 800-73 mandates inclusion of a Security Object consistent with the Authenticity/Integrity
Code defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in [MRTD]. This object
contains message digests of other digital information stored on the card (e.g., the cryptographic
keys and biometric information) and is digitally signed. Table 3-7 identifies the hash algorithms
that may be used to compute the message digests. The set of acceptable algorithms depends
upon the expiration date of the PIV Card, since the hash algorithm must protect the data during
the entire card lifetime. The Security Object format identifies the hash algorithm used when
computing the message digests by inclusion of an object identifier; the appropriate object
identifiers are identified in Table 3-8.

 Note that the parameters may be specified in the cardholder’s public key certificate, or inherited from the issuer’s
certificate. Regardless of source, the OIDs specified in Table 3-5 apply.

4.       Certificate Status Information

The FIPS 201 functional component PIV Card Issuance and Management Subsystem generates
and distributes status information for PIV asymmetric keys. FIPS 201 mandates two formats for
certificate status information:

     +    X.509 CRLs; and
     +    OCSP status response messages.
The CRLs and OCSP status responses are digitally signed to support authentication and integrity.

Table 4-1 below provides specific guidance for digital signatures on PIV status information. For
signatures on the CRLs or OCSP status response messages, the size of the public key and the
hash algorithm used to generate the signature may be determined by the date the CRL or OCSP
message was generated.

                          RSA (1024, 2048, or 3072 bits)   SHA-256                    PSS
                          ECDSA (Recommended Curves,       SHA-224 or SHA-256         N/A

     After 12/31/2010     RSA (2048 or 3072 bits)          SHA-256                    PKCS #1 v.1.5, PSS

                          224 – 283 bits)


CRLs and OCSP messages rely on object identifiers to specify which signature algorithm was
used to generate the digital signature. The algorithms and key sizes specified in Table 3-3 must
be used to sign CRLs and OCSP responses. The object identifiers specified in Table 3-4 must be
used in CRLs and OCSP messages to identify the signature algorithm.




                                                                                         Page 11

5.     PIV Card Management Keys

PIV Cards may support card activation by the card management system to support card
personalization and post-issuance card update. PIV Cards that support card personalization and
post-issuance perform a challenge response protocol using a symmetric cryptographic key (i.e.,
the PIV Card Management Key) to authenticate the card management system. After successful
authentication, the card management system can modify information stored the PIV Card. Table
5-1 below, establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV
Card Management keys according to the card expiration date.
