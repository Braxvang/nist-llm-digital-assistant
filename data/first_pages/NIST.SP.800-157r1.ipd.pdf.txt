85    Reports on Computer Systems Technology

86    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
87    Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
88    leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
89    tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
90    analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
91    responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
92    physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
93    than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
94    Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
95    information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
96    and academic organizations.

97    Abstract

98    This recommendation provides technical guidelines for the implementation of standards-
99    based, secure, reliable credentials that are issued by federal departments and agencies
100   to individuals who possess and prove control of their valid PIV Card. These credentials
101   can be either public key infrastructure (PKI)-based like the PIV Card or non PKI-based
102   but verified by the individual’s home agency. The scope of this document includes
103   requirements for the initial issuance and maintenance of these credentials, certificate
104   policies as applicable, cryptographic specifications, technical specifications for permitted
105   authenticator types, and the command interfaces for removable implementations of such
106   PKI-based credentials.

107   Keywords

108   authentication; credentials; derived PIV credentials; electronic authentication; electronic
109   credentials; mobile devices; personal identity verification; PIV

110   Note to Reviewers

111   Public draft SP 800-157r1 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
112   Credentials expands the use of derived PIV credentials beyond mobile devices to include
113   non-PKI-based phishing resistant multi-factor credentials. The draft details the expanded
114   set of derived PIV credentials in a variety of form factors and authenticator types as
115   envisioned in OMB Memoranda M-19-22, M-22-09, and subsequently outlined in
116   FIPS 201-3. The cross-domain and interagency use of these credentials is provided by
117   federation protocols outlined in public draft SP 800-217 Guidelines for PIV Federation.
118   Both documents are closely aligned with draft release SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity
119   Guidelines. NIST hopes that the draft document enables a close alignment with new

120   and emerging digital authentication and federation technologies employed in the federal
121   government, while maintaining a strong security posture.
122   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
123   topics:
124     1. Are the new controls for issuance, use, maintenance, and termination of non-PKI-
125        based derived PIV credentials clear and practical to implement?
126     2. Are phishing-resistant authenticators available to meet agency use cases as well as
127        the requirements for derived PIV authentication?
128     3. Are the new controls sufficient to provide comparable assurance to PIV Cards and
129        other derived PIV credentials?
130   Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or part of both SP 800-157r1 and SP 800-
131   217. NIST requests that all comments be submitted by 11:59pm Eastern Time on March
132   24, 2023. Please submit your comments to piv comments@nist.gov. NIST will review
133   all comments and make them available at the NIST Computer Security Resource Center
134   (CSRC) website. Commenters are encouraged to use the comment template provided on
135   the NIST Computer Security Resource Center website.

136   Call for Patent Claims

137   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
138   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
139   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
140   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
141   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
142   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
143   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
144   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
145   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
146      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
147         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
148     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
149        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
150        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
151            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
152               discrimination; or
153           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
154               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
155   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
156   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
157   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
158   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
159   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
160   successor-in-interest.
161   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
162   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
163   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:piv comments@nist.gov.

227   1.   Introduction
228   This section is informative.
229   [FIPS 201] specifies a common set of identity credentials to satisfy the requirements of
230   [HSPD-12] in a smart card form factor known as the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
231   Card. This publication is a companion document to FIPS 201 that specifies the use of
232   additional common identity credentials, known as derived PIV credentials, that are issued
233   by a federal department or agency and may be used when the use of a PIV Card is not
234   practical. Consistent with the goals of HSPD-12, derived PIV credentials are designed to
235   serve as a Federal Government-wide standard for a secure and reliable identity credential
236   that supports interoperability across agencies.

237   1.1. Background
238   FIPS 201 originally required that the PIV credential and associated keys be stored in a
239   PIV Card. While the use of the PIV Card for electronic authentication works well with
240   many traditional desktop and laptop computers, it is not well-suited to other devices, such
241   as mobile devices. In response to the growing use of mobile endpoints within the Federal
242   Government, FIPS 201-2 permitted the issuance of additional PKI-based credentials,
243   referred to as derived PIV credentials, for which the corresponding private key is stored
244   in a cryptographic module within a mobile device, such as a smartphone. PKI-based
245   derived PIV credentials use the Federal PKI Infrastructure to securely establish the
246   binding between the credential and the PIV identity account. PKI-based derived PIV
247   credentials are typically integrated into user endpoints, such as mobile devices, although
248   they are not limited to use in these devices.
249   In order to provide additional flexibility for federal departments and agencies, FIPS 201-3
250   expands the set of credentials beyond those that are PKI-based and broadens their use
251   to other types of devices in addition to mobile devices. The technical details for the
252   expanded set of derived PIV credentials is specified in this revision of SP 800-157 (SP
253   800-157, Revision 1) in a variety of form factors. Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials
254   are authenticators (as defined in [SP800-63B]) that may be separate from the endpoint
255   being authenticated and, if so, are connected to the endpoint for that purpose. Since there
256   is no PKI infrastructure to validate and supply attributes for non-PKI-based derived PIV
257   credentials, non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are always used to authenticate to the
258   home agency of the PIV cardholder from which the cardholder’s PIV identity account
259   is accessed. When access to the PIV identity account is needed outside of the home
260   agency — particularly when a non-PKI-based derived PIV credential is presented in
261   authentication — federation allows connection across security domains as detailed in
262   [SP800-217].
263   Derived PIV credentials leverage the current investment in the PIV infrastructure
264   for electronic authentication and build upon the solid foundation of the well-vetted
265   and trusted identity of the PIV cardholder as represented in the PIV identity account,

266   achieving substantial cost savings by leveraging the identity proofing results that were
267   already performed to issue PIV Cards. This document provides technical guidelines for
268   the implementation of derived PIV credentials.

269   1.2. Purpose and Scope
270   This document provides guidelines for cases in which the use of PIV Cards is deemed
271   impractical for authentication. This guideline specifies the use of authenticators with
272   alternative form factors to the PIV Card that may be inserted into endpoints, such as USB
273   authenticators, authenticators that are connected wirelessly to endpoints, or authenticators
274   that are embedded in endpoints. Authenticators used as derived PIV credentials must
275   meet the requirements for either hardware or software cryptographic authenticators. The
276   use of alternative form factors greatly improves the usability of electronic authentication
277   to remote IT resources while simultaneously maintaining the goals of HSPD-12 for
278   common identification that is secure, reliable, and has government-wide interoperability.
279   The purpose of the derived PIV credential is to provide PIV-enabled authentication
280   services on alternative endpoints in order to authenticate the credential holder to remote
281   systems.
282   To achieve interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, two
283   approaches to derived PIV credentials have been selected:
284      1. Use of public key infrastructure (PKI) technology. PKI-based derived PIV
285         credentials rely on the same infrastructure as that used for authentication with a
286         PIV Card.
287      2. Use of non-PKI-based authenticators. When non-PKI-based authenticators are used,
288         derived PIV credentials are only used to authenticate with the home agency of the
289         associated PIV Card. Interoperability with other agencies is achieved through the
290         use of federation protocols, as specified in [SP800-217].
291   The derived PIV credentials specified in this document are issued at authentication
292   assurance level (AAL) 2 or 3.
293   Derived PIV credentials are based on the general concept of post-enrollment authenticator
294   binding in [SP800-63B], which leverages identity proofing and vetting associated with
295   an existing subscriber account using current and valid authenticators to bind additional
296   authenticators to that account. Identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be
297   repeated to issue a derived PIV credential. Instead, the user proves possession and control
298   of a valid PIV Card to bind a derived PIV credential to their PIV identity account. While
299   the PIV Card may be used as the basis for issuing other types of derived credentials, the
300   issuance of these other credentials is outside of the scope of this document.
301   Derived PIV credentials are:
302       • Issued based on possession and control of the PIV Card,

364   2.       Lifecycle Activities and Related Requirements
365   This section is normative.
366   The lifecycle activities for a derived PIV credential are initial issuance, maintenance, and
367   termination. At a more detailed level, the lifecycle activities for PKI-based and non-PKI-
368   based derived PIV credentials differ considerably from each other. This section describes
369   these lifecycle activities and provides requirements and recommendations as appropriate.
370   Issuers of derived PIV credentials SHALL document the process for each of the lifecycle
371   activities described below. In accordance with [HSPD-12], the reliability of the derived
372   PIV credential issuer SHALL be established through an official accreditation process.

373   2.1. Derived PIV Credential Lifecycle Activities
374   The derived PIV credential lifecycle consists of the three classes of activities described
375   above. The activities that take place at the manufacturer during fabrication and pre-
376   personalization of the authenticator (as applicable) are not considered part of this lifecycle
377   model. Figure 1 presents the PKI-based derived PIV credential activities alongside the
378   PIV Card lifecycle activities. Figure 2 presents the corresponding lifecycle activities for
379   non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials.

380   The lifecycle of a derived PIV credential begins with the issuance of a derived PIV
381   credential on an approved device or authenticator associated with the applicant. This
382   may be part of the process of issuing a PIV Card or a subsequent process. Mobile devices
383   with derived PIV credentials are managed as described in [SP800-124].
384   The maintenance activities for a PKI-based derived PIV credential are the same as
385   for other X.509 public key certificates. Certificate re-key is typically used to replace

386   a certificate that is nearing expiration. Certificate modification is used to replace a
387   certificate if information about the subscriber that appears in the certificate, such as their
388   name, needs to be changed.
389   While non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are not typically re-keyed and do not
390   contain PII about the subscriber, they may require maintenance, such as replacing the
391   activation secret or biometric factor used to activate the physical authenticator. Instead
392   of re-keying, the current non-PKI-based derived PIV credential SHALL be invalidated
393   and the initial issuance process (except for the device or authenticator approval process)
394   repeated to bind a new derived PIV credential. When a non-PKI-based derived PIV
395   credential is lost, stolen, or damaged, the issuer SHALL invalidate the credential to
396   prevent its further use.
397   When an authenticator that contains the private key corresponding to a PKI-based derived
398   PIV credential is lost, stolen, or damaged, the issuer SHALL prevent further use of the
399   affected credential by either collecting and destroying the associated private key or by
400   revoking the associated certificate. These processes are described in Sec. 2.4. If the
401   subscriber becomes ineligible to possess a PIV Card, all derived PIV credentials for that
402   subscriber are revoked or otherwise invalidated.

403   2.2. Initial Issuance
404   The issuance of a derived PIV credential is an instance of the post-enrollment binding
405   of an authenticator described in [SP800-63B]. Issuance SHALL be performed in
406   accordance with the requirements that apply to cryptographic authenticators as well as
407   the requirements in this section. The term issuance is used in cases where the device or
408   authenticator is provided to the subscriber as well as when the device or authenticator is

                                                                                                 6
      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                           Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)

409   already in the subscriber’s possession. Appendix C provides sample issuance processes
410   for derived PIV credentials.
411   Derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued only by the home agency of the associated
412   PIV identity account. Derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued only to devices (such as
413   mobile devices) or authenticators that are approved by the home agency. Agencies MAY
414   establish blanket approvals for particular device types or MAY individually authorize
415   specific devices or authenticators for issuance and use by a cardholder. Authorization
416   policies for issuance SHALL be documented by each issuer.
417   Derived PIV credentials MAY be issued remotely or in person. At the time of issuance,
418   the applicant SHALL authenticate to the derived PIV credential issuer using their PIV
419   Card. This authentication SHALL be performed using the PKI-AUTH authentication
420   mechanism described in Sec. 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201]. This authentication MAY be
421   performed remotely. In addition to authenticating the cardholder, performing the PKI-
422   AUTH authentication mechanism verifies that the applicant is currently eligible to
423   possess a PIV Card. All derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued in accordance with
424   [SP800-63B] Sec. 6.1.2.1.
425   All derived PIV credentials for use at AAL3 SHALL be issued in accordance with the
426   following additional requirements. The applicant SHALL identify themself using a
427   biometric sample that can be verified against their PIV Card or against the biometric
428   information in their enrollment record. If the issuance process consists of two or more
429   transactions, the applicant SHALL identify themself using a biometric sample that can
430   be verified against either their PIV Card or against a biometric that was recorded in a
431   previous transaction. The issuer SHALL retain the biometric sample used to verify the
432   applicant for future reference.
433   After the applicant has been authenticated, a derived PIV credential MAY be issued and
434   associated with the cardholder’s PIV identity account. The newly issued derived PIV
435   credential SHALL be represented in the cardholder’s PIV identity account.
436   When a new derived PIV credential is associated with a PIV identity account, the issuer
437    SHALL promptly notify the PIV cardholder of the binding of a derived PIV credential
438   through an independent means that would not afford an attacker the opportunity to
439   interfere with the notification. More than one independent notification method MAY
440   be used to ensure prompt receipt by the cardholder.
441   Derived PIV credentials SHALL meet the requirements for authentication assurance
442   level (AAL) 2 or 3 specified in [SP800-63B]. Derived PIV credentials that meet AAL3
443   requirements also fulfill the requirements of AAL2 and can be used in circumstances that
444   require authentication at AAL2. All derived PIV credentials at both AAL2 and AAL3
445    SHALL meet the requirements for phishing resistance defined in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.5.

446   This guideline does not preclude the issuance of multiple derived PIV credentials to the
447   same applicant on the basis of the same PIV Card. This could increase the risk that one of

                                                  7
      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


448   the derived PIV credentials will be lost/stolen without the loss being reported or that the
449   subscriber will inappropriately provide one of them to someone else. Accordingly, issuers
450    MAY place a limit on the number of active derived PIV credentials that a subscriber may
451   have.

452   2.2.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Issuance
453   Issuance of a PKI-based derived PIV credential requires the generation of a public/private
454   keypair followed by the creation of a corresponding authentication certificate by the
455   CSP. For a derived PIV credential capable of being used at AAL3, the keypair SHALL
456   be generated in the device (authenticator or endpoint) that will house the derived PIV
457   credential. The device SHALL send the certificate signing request that contains the
458   public key to the CSP, which SHALL return an X.509 authentication certificate that
459    SHALL be stored on the credential. The CSP SHALL retain a copy of the issued
460   certificate for use should revocation be required. For a derived PIV credential that is
461   issued for use only at AAL2, the same procedure MAY be used, or the CSP MAY
462   generate a keypair and corresponding certificate and send the certificate and private key
463   to the device over an authenticated protected channel for installation. The CSP SHALL
464   immediately and securely delete its copy of the private key.
465   The private key SHALL be stored on the device in a manner that makes it accessible
466   only upon entry of the correct activation secret or presentation of a biometric factor that
467   matches a stored biometric image or template. This SHALL be accomplished either
468   through the use of strong access controls for the stored private key or through decryption
469   of the private key using an encryption key that is derived from the activation secret.

470   2.2.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Issuance
471   The applicant SHALL be provided with or supply an approved physical authenticator
472   for the highest AAL that the derived PIV credential will be used to authenticate. If the
473   authenticator is not directly provided by the issuer (i.e., the home agency), the issuer
474    SHALL verify that the authenticator’s characteristics (e.g., single-factor or multi-factor)
475   meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] for the highest authentication assurance level at
476   which it will be used (AAL2 or AAL3), including [FIPS140] requirements.
477   The issuance process for a multi-factor authenticator SHALL prompt the applicant to
478   establish a memorized secret or biometric activation factor (or both) for the authenticator
479   and successfully authenticate using that authenticator. The issuance process with a single-
480   factor authenticator SHALL prompt the applicant to register a memorized secret that
481   meets the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.1 and that will be verified along with the
482   physical authenticator in the authentication process.

      January 2023


483   2.3. Maintenance
484   The maintenance activities required for derived PIV credentials depend on the type of
485   derived PIV credential (PKI-based or non-PKI-based) being used. Maintenance activities
486   include rekeying, modification of certificates, and replacement of an activation factor
487   (biometric or memorized secret) as appropriate.
488   Derived PIV credentials are unaffected when the subscriber replaces their PIV Card with
489   a new one (reissuance) or when the PIV Card is lost, stolen, or damaged. The ability for
490   the subscriber to use a derived PIV credential is especially useful while waiting for a
491   new PIV Card to be issued. In such circumstances, the subscriber continues to be able
492   to use the derived PIV credential to gain logical access to remote federally controlled
493   information systems from their endpoint.
494   Updating the activation data (biometric or memorized secret, such as a PIN) or resetting
495   the activation retry count for a derived PIV credential SHALL be performed in
496   accordance with Sec. 3.1.4 for PKI-based derived PIV credentials or Sec. 3.2.3 for non-
497   PKI-based derived PIV credentials.

498   2.3.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Maintenance
499   PKI-based derived PIV credentials require typical maintenance activities applicable
500   to asymmetric cryptographic credentials, including rekeying and modification. These
501   activities MAY be performed either remotely or in person and SHALL be performed
502   in accordance with the certificate policy under which the derived PIV authentication
503   certificate is issued. When certificate rekeying or modification is performed remotely
504   for a derived PIV credential, communication between the issuer and the cryptographic
505   module in which the derived PIV authentication private key is stored SHALL only occur
506   over mutually authenticated secure sessions between tested and validated cryptographic
507   modules.
508   Some maintenance activities for the subscriber’s PIV Card may trigger corresponding
509   maintenance activities for the derived PIV credential since the derived PIV credential will
510   need to be reissued if any information about the subscriber that appears in the credential
511   changes. For example, if the subscriber’s PIV Card is reissued as a result of a change in
512   the subscriber’s name and the subscriber’s name appears in the derived PIV authentication
513   certificate, a new derived PIV authentication certificate with the new name SHALL be
514   issued and the previous certificate invalidated.

515   2.3.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Maintenance
516   The maintenance activities for non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are somewhat
517   simpler than for PKI-based derived PIV credentials since the former do not contain
518   information about the cardholder and do not carry a specific expiration date. Identity
519   information SHALL be maintained in the PIV identity account and SHALL be updated
520   when needed.

                                                  9

      January 2023


521   Updating a separate memorized secret used with a single-factor authenticator for use
522   at AAL2 SHALL be performed in a mutually authenticated protected session with the
523   home agency. The update SHALL require the entry of the current memorized secret
524   used for activation. If resetting the memorized secret is required because the subscriber
525   has forgotten the memorized secret or has reached the retry limit, it SHALL be done in
526   accordance with Sec. 3.2.3.

527   2.4. Invalidation
528   When an authenticator associated with a derived PIV credential is compromised (e.g.,
529   lost, stolen, or damaged), that derived PIV credential SHALL be invalidated as described
530   below.
531   All derived PIV credentials associated with a given PIV Card SHALL be invalidated
532   when the associated PIV identity account is terminated, typically due to the cardholder’s
533   loss of PIV Card eligibility. Issuers of derived PIV credentials SHALL continuously
534   monitor the associated PIV identity account to determine its termination status. Meeting
535   this requirement is simplified because the subject’s PIV Card, cardholder eligibility, and
536   all derived PIV credentials are maintained in one account — the PIV identity account —
537   and maintained by the home agency.
538   The issuer of the derived PIV credential SHALL NOT solely rely on tracking the
539   revocation status of the PIV authentication certificate as a means of tracking the
540   termination status of the PIV Card. This is because there are situations in which the PIV
541   authentication certificate is not revoked even though the PIV Card has been terminated
542   and subsequently replaced with a new card. This may happen, for example, when a
543   terminated PIV Card is collected and either zeroized or destroyed by an agency. In this
544   case and in accordance with [FIPS201], the corresponding PIV authentication certificate
545   does not need to be revoked.

546   2.4.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Invalidation
547   If the derived PIV authentication private key was created and stored on a hardware
548   module that does not permit export of the private key and the token is collected and
549   either zeroized or destroyed, then the derived PIV authentication certificate SHOULD be
550   revoked. In all other cases, the derived PIV authentication certificate SHALL be revoked.

551   2.4.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Invalidation
552   Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are always directly verified by the home agency
553   of the associated PIV Card. Therefore, termination of a non-PKI-based derived PIV
554   credential SHALL be accomplished by invalidating the reference to the associated
555   authenticator in the PIV identity account so that the authenticator cannot be used to
556   authenticate to the home agency. Separate hardware-based authenticators MAY be
557   collected from the subscriber, but this is not required.

558   3.   Technical Requirements
559   This section is normative.
560   This section describes technical requirements for both PKI-based and non-PKI-based
561   derived PIV credentials and associated authenticators.
562   While the following sections focus on credential and authenticator requirements, the
563   verifier is required to meet the corresponding verifier requirements in [SP800-63B] Sec.
564   5.1.

565   3.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credentials
566   A PKI-based derived PIV credential is a derived PIV authentication certificate, which is
567   an X.509 public key certificate that has been issued in accordance with the requirements
568   of this document and [COMMON]. All derived PIV credentials created under previous
569   revisions of these guidelines are PKI-based and remain valid implementations under this
570   revision of SP 800-157. Additional requirements for PKI-based derived PIV credentials
571   that are removable or wireless are found in Appendix B.
572   Authentication using PKI-based derived PIV credentials SHALL include a check to
573   determine that the authentication certificate is valid and current (e.g., that the certificate is
574   unexpired and not revoked).

575   3.1.1. Certiﬁcate Policies for Derived PIV Credentials
576   Derived PIV authentication certificates SHALL be issued under either the id-fpki-
577   common-derived-pivAuth-hardware policy (satisfying [SP800-63B] AAL3) or the
578   id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth policy (satisfying AAL2) of [COMMON]. All
579   derived PIV credentials SHALL be deemed to satisfy [SP800-63A] IAL3 since that is the
580   identity proofing and issuance level associated with the PIV Card and bound to the PIV
581   identity account.
582   Derived PIV authentication certificates SHALL comply with the Derived PIV
583   Authentication Certificate profile in [PROF].
584   The expiration date of a derived PIV authentication certificate is based on the certificate
585   policy of the issuer. There is no requirement to align the expiration date of a derived PIV
586   authentication certificate with the expiration date of the PIV authentication certificate or
587   the expiration of the PIV Card. However, in many cases, aligning the expiration dates will
588   simplify lifecycle management.

589   3.1.2. Cryptographic Speciﬁcations
590   The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements for the derived PIV authentication
591   certificates and private keys are the same as the requirements for the PIV authentication
592   certificate and private key, as specified in [SP800-78].

      January 2023


593   For derived PIV authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-
594   derived-hardware (AAL3), the derived PIV authentication key pair SHALL be
595   generated within a hardware cryptographic module that meets the requirements of
596   [SP800-63B] Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to [FIPS140] Level 2 or higher with
597   Level 3 physical security to protect the derived PIV authentication private key while in
598   storage and not permitting export of the private key.
599   For derived PIV authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-
600   derived (AAL2), the derived PIV authentication key pair SHALL be generated within a
601   cryptographic module that has been validated to [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher. If the key
602   pair is generated outside of the authenticator itself, the private key SHALL be transferred
603   via an authenticated protected channel as defined in [SP800-63B], and the authenticator
604    SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to
605   [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.

606   3.1.3. Allowable Authenticator Types
607   Phishing-resistant multi-factor cryptographic authenticators SHALL be used for PKI-
608   based derived PIV authentication. A multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator as
609   specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.9.1 SHALL be used for derived PIV authentication
610   at AAL3. Either a multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator or a multi-factor
611   cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.8.1 SHALL be
612   used for derived PIV authentication at AAL2.

613   3.1.4. Activation Data
614   Activation of the derived PIV authenticator using a memorized secret SHALL meet the
615   requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.11. Activation using a biometric characteristic
616    SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.3. Unlocking the device that
617   houses a derived PIV authenticator (e.g., mobile phone) SHALL NOT be considered
618   activation of the authenticator. Separate entry of the activation secret or presentation
619   of a biometric factor SHALL be performed to use the authenticator. The same secret or
620   biometric factor used to unlock the device MAY be used to activate the authenticator.
621   If the memorized secret used for activation or the biometric activation factor needs to
622   be changed, entry of the current memorized secret SHALL be required to change the
623   value. If the activation secret has been forgotten or the permitted number of consecutive
624   wrong attempts has been reached, the home agency SHALL be required to input the PIN
625   unblocking key (PUK). If the PUK is not implemented by the authenticator or cannot
626   be provided, either the authenticator certificates SHALL be revoked or the associated
627   private keys SHALL be destroyed or zeroized. A new derived PIV credential MAY then
628   be obtained.

      January 2023


629   3.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credentials
630   When used, non-PKI-based credentials SHALL be used to authenticate only to the home
631   agency of the associated PIV Card.

632   3.2.1. Allowable Authenticator Types
633   Phishing-resistant multi-factor or single-factor cryptographic authenticators SHALL be
634   used for non-PKI-based derived PIV authentication. A multi-factor cryptographic device
635   authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.9.1 or a single-factor cryptographic
636   device authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.7.1 SHALL be used for derived
637   PIV authentication at AAL3. Either a cryptographic device authenticator or a multi-factor
638   cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.8.1 or a single-
639   factor cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.6.1
640    SHALL be used for derived PIV authentication at AAL2. All single-factor authenticators
641    SHALL be used in conjunction with a memorized secret that meets the requirements of
642   [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.1.1.

643   3.2.2. Cryptographic Speciﬁcations
644   Authenticators used as non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials SHALL meet the
645   cryptographic requirements specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1 for the corresponding
646   authenticator type.

647   3.2.3. Activation Data
648   Activation of a multi-factor authenticator being used as a derived PIV credential using a
649   memorized secret SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.11. Activation
650   using a biometric characteristic SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B]
651   Sec. 5.2.3. Unlocking the device that houses the authenticator (e.g., mobile phone)
652    SHALL NOT be considered activation of the authenticator. Separate entry of the
653   activation secret or presentation of a biometric factor SHALL be performed to use the
654   authenticator. The same activation secret or biometric factor used to unlock the device
655    MAY be used to activate the authenticator.

656   If the memorized secret used for activation or the biometric activation factor needs to be
657   changed, entry of the current activation secret SHALL be required to change the value.
658   If the activation secret has been forgotten or the permitted number of consecutive wrong
659   attempts has been reached, the activation secret and attempt counter MAY be reset by
660   centralized management by the home agency. If centralized reset is not available, the
661   authenticator SHALL be reset and require re-binding to the PIV identity account, as
662   described in Sec. 3.3.

663   3.3. Binding Derived PIV Credentials
664   Binding a derived PIV credential to a PIV identity account can be accomplished through
665   a connection to a PIV-authenticated endpoint, a direct connection to the PIV Card, or the
666   use of the external authenticator binding procedure, as described in [SP800-63B] Sec.
667   6.1.2.4. In all cases, binding SHALL require the use of the PIV-AUTH authentication
668   mechanism specified in [FIPS201].

721   Appendix A.      Digital Signature and Key Management Keys
722   This appendix is informative.
723   In addition to the PIV authentication keys, [FIPS201] also requires each PIV Card to
724   have a digital signature key and a key management key unless the cardholder does not
725   have a government-issued email account at the time of credential issuance. A subscriber
726   who has been issued a derived PIV credential may also need a digital signature and key
727   management key.
728   For most subscribers, it will be necessary to store a copy of the PIV Card’s key
729   management private key and certificate in the keystore that hosts the derived PIV
730   credential. Similarly, copies of some or all of the PIV Card’s retired key management
731   private keys and certificates should be stored in the derived PIV credential keystore.
732   Neither [FIPS201] nor [COMMON] precludes a key management private key from being
733   used on more than one device (e.g., the PIV Card and a derived PIV credential keystore)
734   as long as all of the requirements of the policy under which the key management
735   certificate was issued are satisfied. This means that in order to use a copy of a key
736   management private key in a [FIPS140] Level 1 software cryptographic module, the
737   corresponding certificate would have to be issued under a certificate policy, such
738   as id-fpki-common-policy, that does not require the use of a [FIPS140] Level 2
739   hardware cryptographic module. This should be taken into account at the time that the
740   key management certificate that will be placed on the PIV Card is issued. Key recovery
741   mechanisms are encouraged for key management keys that will be used on derived PIV
742   credential keystores.
743   As the digital signature key on a PIV Card cannot be copied, a new digital signature
744   private key will need to be generated and a corresponding certificate will need to be
745   issued for the derived PIV credential keystore. The issuance of this private key and
746   certificate is independent of the issuance of the PIV Card. As the certificate policies
747   associated with digital signature certificates in [COMMON] (id-fpki-common-policy,
748   id-fpki-common-hardware, and id-fpki-common-High) are not limited to use with
749   PIV Cards, a digital signature certificate for a derived PIV credential keystore may be
750   issued under one of these policies as long as all of the policy requirements are satisfied.

751   Appendix B.      Data Model and Interfaces for Removable or Wireless PKI-based
752                    Hardware Cryptographic Devices
753   This appendix is normative.
754   This appendix provides data model and interface requirements for PKI-based derived
755   PIV applications that are implemented on removable or wireless hardware cryptographic
756   tokens.

757   B.1. Derived PIV Application Data Model and Representation
758   The data model and representation requirements for derived PIV applications are based
759   on the requirements for PIV Card applications, as described in [SP800-73] Part 1. The
760   specifications for the mandatory and optional data objects listed below are the same as the
761   specifications for the corresponding data objects on a PIV Card application, as described
762   in [SP800-73] Part 1.

763   B.1.1. Derived PIV Application Identiﬁer
764   The application identifier (AID) of the derived PIV application SHALL be (in
765   hexadecimal):
766    A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00
767   The derived PIV application can be selected as the current application on the removable
768   hardware cryptographic token by providing the full AID listed above or by providing the
769   right truncated version, as follows (hexadecimal):
770    A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00

771   B.1.2. Derived PIV Application Data Model Elements
772   The derived PIV application SHALL contain the following mandatory interoperable data
773   object:
774   X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication
775      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for derived PIV authentication
776      and the PKI cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key
777      are as described for the X.509 certificate for PIV authentication in Sec. 3.1.3 of
778      [SP800-73] Part 1.
779   The following data objects MAY also be present:
780   X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature
781      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for digital signature and the PKI
782      cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key are as described
783      in Sec. 3.2.1 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

784   X.509 Certificate for Key Management
785      The read access control rule for the X.509 certificate for key management and the PKI
786      cryptographic function access rule for the corresponding private key are as described
787      in Sec. 3.2.2 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

788   Discovery Object
789      The requirements for the discovery object are as described in Sec. 3.3.2 of [SP800-73]
790      Part 1, except for the following:
791          • References to “PIV card application AID” are replaced by “derived PIV
792            application AID.”
793          • References to “PIV card application PIN” are replaced by “derived PIV
794            activation secret.”
795          • The first byte of the PIN usage policy SHALL be set to 0x40 to indicate that
796            the virtual contact interface (VCI) is not implemented, 0x48 to indicate that a
797            pairing code is required to establish a VCI, or 0x4C to indicate that no pairing
798            code is required to establish a VCI. This also means that neither the global
799            PIN nor the on-card biometric comparison (OCC) satisfies the access control
800            rules for command execution and data object access within the derived PIV
801            application.

802   Key History Object
803      Up to 20 retired key management private keys MAY be stored in the derived
804      PIV application. The Key History Object SHALL be present in the derived PIV
805      application if the derived PIV application contains any retired key management
806      private keys but MAY be present even if no such keys are present in the derived PIV
807      application. The requirements for the key history object are as described in Sec. 3.3.3
808      of [SP800-73] Part 1, except for the following:
809          • References to keysWithOnCardCerts SHOULD be interpreted as keys for which
810            the corresponding certificate is populated within the derived PIV application.
811          • References to keysWithOffCardCerts SHOULD be interpreted as keys for which
812            the corresponding certificate is not populated within the derived PIV application.
813          • References to offCardCertURL SHOULD be interpreted as a URL that points
814            to a file containing the certificates that correspond to all of the retired key
815            management private keys within the derived PIV application, including those for
816            which the corresponding certificate is stored within the derived PIV application.

817   Retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management
818      The read access control rules for the retired X.509 certificates for key management
819      and the PKI cryptographic function access rules for corresponding private keys are as
820      described in Sec. 3.3.4 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

821   Security Object
822      The security object SHALL be present in the derived PIV application if the discovery
823      object, the key history object, or the optional pairing code reference data container
824      is present. The requirements for the security object are as described in Sec. 3.1.7 of
825      [SP800-73] Part 1, except for the following:
826         • The security object for a derived PIV application is signed using a private key
827           whose corresponding public key is contained in a PIV content signing certificate
828           that satisfies the requirements for certificates used to verify signatures on
829           cardholder unique identifiers (CHUID), as specified in Sec. 4.2.1 of [FIPS201].
830         • The signature field of the Security Object, tag 0xBB, SHALL include the derived
831           PIV credential issuer’s certificate.
832         • All unsigned data objects (i.e., the discovery object, the key history object, and
833           the pairing code reference data container) within the derived PIV application
834            SHALL be included in the security object.


835   Secure Messaging Certificate Signer
836      Derived PIV credential applications that support the virtual contact interface (VCI)
837      capability SHALL include the secure messaging certificate signer object described in
838      Sec. 3.3.7 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

839   Pairing Code Reference Data Container
840      Derived PIV credential applications that support the virtual contact interface (VCI)
841      using a pairing code SHALL include the pairing code reference data container
842      described in Sec. 3.3.8 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

848   The detailed data model specifications for each of the data objects of the derived PIV
849   application are the same as the specifications for the corresponding data objects (mapped
850   per Table 1) of the PIV Card application as described in Appendix A of [SP800-73] Part 1,
851   except for the following:
852       • The security object for the derived PIV application is optional. It is required if the
853         optional discovery object, the optional key history object, or the optional pairing
854         code reference data container is present.
855       • The minimum capacity for the security object container SHALL be 3000 bytes in
856         order to allow space for the derived PIV credential issuer’s certificate.

857   B.1.3. Derived PIV Application Data Objects Representation
858   The ASN.1 object identifiers (OID) and “basic encoding rules – tag length value” (BER-

869   The key reference specifications in Sec. 5.1 of [SP800-73] Part 1 are applicable to the
870   corresponding keys included in the derived PIV application (mapped per Table 2), except
871   for the following:
872       • References to “PIV Card application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
873       • References in the “Security Condition for Use” column to “PIN or OCC” are
874         replaced with “derived PIV activation secret.”

875   B.1.4.2. Derived PIV Application Cryptographic Algorithm and Mechanism Identiﬁers
876   The algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that MAY be recognized on
877   the derived PIV application interfaces are the symmetric and asymmetric identifiers
878   specified in Table 6-2 and Table 6-3 of [SP800-78]. The cryptographic mechanism
879   identifiers that MAY be recognized on the derived PIV application interfaces are those
880   specified in Table 5 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

881   B.1.4.3. Derived PIV Application Status Words
882   The status words that MAY be returned on the derived PIV application command
883   interface are as specified in Sec. 5.6 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

884   B.1.5. Derived PIV Authentication Mechanisms
885   The derived PIV application supports the following validation steps:
886       • Credential validation (CredV) is established by verifying the certificates retrieved
887         from the derived PIV application and checking the validity and revocation status of
888         these certificates.

      January 2023


889       • Derived PIV application holder validation (HolderV) is established when the
890         authenticator holder proves knowledge of the derived PIV activation secret
891         associated with the derived PIV credential that contains valid and unrevoked
892         certificates.
893   The derived PIV application facilitates a single authentication mechanism, which is a
894   cryptographic challenge and response authentication protocol that uses the derived PIV
895   authentication private key as described in Appendix B.1.2 of [SP800-73] Part 1 with the
896   following translations:
897       • References to “PIV application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
898       • References to “PIV auth certificate” are replaced with “derived PIV authentication
899         certificate.”
900       • References to “PIV Card app ID” are replaced with “derived PIV application ID.”
901   The authentication can also be performed wirelessly over a virtual contact interface (VCI)
902   if a VCI has been established with the derived PIV application.

903   B.2. Derived PIV Application Token Command Interface
904   This appendix contains the technical specifications for the command interface to the
905   derived PIV application surfaced by the card edge of the integrated circuit card (ICC) that
906   represents the removable hardware cryptographic token. The command interface for the
907   derived PIV application SHALL implement all of the card commands supported by the
908   PIV Card application as described in [SP800-73] Part 2, which include:
909       • SELECT
910       • GET DATA
911       • VERIFY
912       • CHANGE REFERENCE DATA
913       • RESET RETRY COUNTER
914       • GENERAL AUTHENTICATE
915       • PUT DATA
916       • GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR
917   The specifications for the token command interface SHALL be the same as the
918   specifications for the corresponding card edge commands for a PIV Card as described
919   in [SP800-73] Part 2, except for the following deviations:
920       • References to “PIV Card application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
921       • References to “PIV data objects” are replaced with “derived PIV data objects.”

922       • References to “PIV authentication key” are replaced with “derived PIV
923         authentication key.”
924       • The derived PIV activation secret SHALL satisfy the criteria specified in Appendix
925         B.2.1 of this document rather than Sec. 2.4.3 of [SP800-73] Part 2.
926       • In Appendix A:
927           – References to “PIV Card application administrator” are replaced with “derived
928             PIV application administrator.”
929           – References to “card management key” are replaced with “derived PIV token
930             management key.”
931   The token platform SHALL support a default selected application, which is the selected
932   application that immediately following a cold or warm reset. This default application may
933   be the derived PIV application or another application.

934   B.2.1. Authentication of an Individual
935   Knowledge of a memorized secret (specifically the derived PIV activation secret) is the
936   means by which an individual can be authenticated to the derived PIV application.
937   The derived PIV activation secret SHALL be between 6 and 8 bytes in length. If the
938   actual length of the derived PIV activation secret is less than 8 bytes, it SHALL be
939   padded to 8 bytes with 0xFF when presented to the token command interface. The 0xFF
940   padding bytes SHALL be appended to the actual value of the secret. The bytes that
941   comprise the derived PIV activation secret SHALL be limited to values 0x30 – 0x39,
942   0x41 – 0x5A, and 0x61 – 0x7A: the ASCII values for the decimal digits ‘0’ – ‘9’; upper
943   case characters ‘A’ – ‘Z’; and lower case characters ‘a’ – ‘z’. For example,
944       • Actual derived PIV activation secret: “Part21” or (hexadecimal) 50 61 72 74 32
945         31
946       • Padded derived PIV activation secret presented to the card command interface
947         (hexadecimal): 50 61 72 74 32 31 FF FF
948 The derived PIV application SHALL enforce the minimum length requirement of 6 bytes
949 for the derived PIV activation secret (i.e., SHALL verify that at least the first 6 bytes of
950 the value presented to the card command interface are in the range 0x30 – 0x39, 0x41
951 – 0x5A, or 0x61 – 0x7A) as well as the other formatting requirements specified in this

952 section.

      January 2023


953   Appendix C.      Example Issuance Processes
954   This appendix is informative.
955   The issuance process for a derived PIV credential varies depending on whether the
956   derived PIV credential is being issued at AAL2 or AAL3. Section 2.2 specifies the
957   requirements for initial issuance. This appendix provides two example issuance processes
958   that satisfy those requirements: one at AAL2 and another at AAL3.

959   C.1. Example Issuance of a Derived PIV Credential at AAL2
960   The following is an example of a PKI-based derived PIV credential.
961   An employee requires a mobile device for work. The mobile device is ordered, and a
962   request for the issuance of a derived PIV credential is submitted to the agency’s approval
963   authority.
964   Following receipt of the device and approval, the employee starts the binding process
965   remotely — such as from their home — by visiting a derived PIV credential website
966   operated by or on behalf of their PIV Card’s home agency. The website requires TLS
967   client authentication using the PIV authentication certificate on the employee’s PIV Card.
968   The employee performs this step from a desktop computer since they cannot use their PIV
969   Card on a mobile device. By requiring and validating a PIV Authentication certificate
970   when connecting to the website, the server authenticates the employee and verifies
971   that the employee is still eligible to possess a PIV Card. If the employee successfully
972   authenticates to the server, the issuer generates and displays a binding secret to the
973   employee.
974   The employee then runs a provisioning application on the mobile device. The application
975   asks the employee to identify themself and enter the binding secret that was previously
976   provided from the desktop website to create an activation secret, which will subsequently
977   be used to authenticate to the cryptographic module. The application generates a key
978   pair within the device’s cryptographic module and submits the binding secret and
979   newly generated public key to the PIV issuer as part of a certificate request. The PIV
980   issuer authenticates the employee by verifying that the binding secret in the certificate
981   request matches the one that it previously issued and forwards the public key to the CA,
982   which signs and issues the derived PIV credential (i.e., the derived PIV authentication
983   certificate). The provisioning application loads the derived PIV authentication certificate
984   on the mobile device. The PIV Card issuer enters information about the new derived PIV
985   credential into the subscriber’s PIV identity account. The cardholder is notified of the
986   binding of the new derived PIV credential.
987   Normative requirements for this process are given in [SP800-63B] Sec. 6.1.2.4 and in
988   Sec. 2.2 of this document.

       January 2023


989    C.2. Example Binding of a Derived PIV Credential at AAL3
990    An employee requires a derived PIV credential to access a relying party using one or
991    more endpoints that do not accommodate the direct use of a PIV Card. The employee
992    requests a non-PKI-based authenticator capable of authentication at AAL3 and approval
993    to use that authenticator as a derived PIV credential. The request is approved by the
994    agency’s approval authority.
995    After receiving the approval and authenticator, the employee starts the binding process
996    by authenticating with their PIV Card at a derived PIV credential website operated by
997    or on behalf of the PIV cardholder’s home agency. The employee additionally provides
998    a biometric sample that can be verified against their PIV Card. The website requires
999    TLS client authentication using the PIV authentication certificate on the employee’s PIV
1000   Card. The employee then inserts (connects) the authenticator to be used as a derived
1001   PIV credential and registers (binds) that credential, including establishing a second
1002   authentication factor (activation secret or biometric characteristic) if that has not already
1003   been done. The website determines whether the authenticator meets AAL3 requirements.
1004   Upon successful registration, the subscriber’s key and appropriate metadata are stored
1005   for use by the home agency’s endpoint for non-PKI-based PIV authentication. The PIV
1006   Card issuer enters information about the new derived PIV credential into the subscriber’s
1007   PIV identity account. The cardholder is notified of the binding of the new derived PIV
1008   credential.
1009   If the authenticator uses verifier name binding as described in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.5.2,
1010   the website used to register the authenticator has to share the same domain name as will
1011   be used by the home agency to authenticate the subscriber so that the same keys are used
1012   for registration and authentication.
