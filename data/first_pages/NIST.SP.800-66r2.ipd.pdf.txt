100   The HIPAA Security Rule focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information
101   (ePHI) held or maintained by regulated entities. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates,
102   receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats,
103   hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. This publication provides practical guidance
104   and resources that can be used by regulated entities of all sizes to protect ePHI and better
105   understand the security concepts discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule.

166                                        Call for Patent Claims

167   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
168   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
169   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
170   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
171   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
172   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

173   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
174   in written or electronic form, either:

175      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
176         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or

177      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
178         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
179         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:

180             i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
181                  discrimination; or
182            ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
183                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

184   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
185   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
186   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
187   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
188   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

189   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
190   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

191   Such statements should be addressed to sp800-66-comments@nist.gov with the Subject: “SP
192   800-66 Call for Patent Claims.”

194   Executive Summary

195   This publication aims to help educate readers about the security standards included in the Health
196   Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule [Sec. Rule], as amended by
197   the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules
198   Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [HITECH] and
199   the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to the HIPAA Rules
200   [Omnibus Rule] 1 and assist regulated entities 2 in their implementation of the Security Rule. It
201   includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for regulated entities
202   on assessing and managing risks to electronic protected health information (ePHI), identifies
203   typical activities that a regulated entity might consider implementing as part of an information
204   security program, and lists additional resources that regulated entities may find useful in
205   implementing the Security Rule.

206   The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and
207   availability of ePHI, as defined in the Security Rule. All HIPAA regulated entities must comply
208   with the requirements of the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives,
209   maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and
210   impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and
211   implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following regulated entities:

212        •    Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or
213             supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a
214             transaction for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has
215             adopted a standard.
216        •    Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical
217             care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).
218        •    Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s
219             healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa.
220        •    Business Associate – A person or entity 3 that performs certain functions or activities that
221             involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides
222             services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for their own HIPAA
223             violations.

224   The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards that a
225   regulated entity must address. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An
226   implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach that
227   regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. Implementation specifications are either
228   required or addressable. Regulated entities must comply with required implementation
229   specifications. Regulated entities must perform an assessment to determine whether each


      1 For the remainder of this document, references to and discussions about the Security Rule will be to the Security Rule as

       amended by the Omnibus Rule unless otherwise specified.
      2 A “regulated entity” refers to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the Security Rule. Business associates

       also includes business associates’ subcontractors who have access to ePHI.
      3 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or

       healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.

                                                                       vi

230   addressable implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for
231   implementation in the regulated entity’s environment.

234   reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
235   does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. Section 3
236   and Section 4 provide background information about risk assessment and risk management
237   processes, as well as approaches that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing and
238   managing risk to ePHI.

239   Many regulated entities may benefit from more specific guidance concerning how to comply
240   with the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule. To that end, Section 5
241   highlights considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. Key
242   activities, descriptions, and sample questions are provided for each standard. The key activities
243   suggest actions that are often associated with the security function or functions suggested by that
244   standard. Many of these key activities are often included in a robust security program and may
245   be useful to regulated entities. The descriptions provide expanded explanations about each of the
246   key activities, as well as the types of activities that a regulated entity may pursue in
247   implementing the standard. The sample questions are a non-exhaustive list of questions that a
248   regulated entity may ask itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately
249   implemented.

250   Regulated entities may implement the Security Rule more effectively if they are shown controls
251   catalogs and cybersecurity activities that align with each standard. To assist regulated entities,
252   this publication includes mappings of the Security Rule’s standards and implementation
253   specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and to applicable security
254   controls detailed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls
255   for Information Systems and Organizations [SP 800-53]. The mapping also lists additional NIST
256   publications relevant to each Security Rule standard. Readers may draw upon these NIST
257   publications and mappings for assistance in implementing the Security Rule.

258   Additionally, the publication lists a wide variety of resources (e.g., guidance, templates, tools)
259   that regulated entities may find useful in complying with the Security Rule and improving the
260   security posture of their organizations. For ease of use, the resources are organized by topic.
261   Regulated entities could consult these resources when they need additional information or
262   guidance about a particular topic. The resource topics include:

263      •   Risk Assessment and Risk Management
264      •   Documentation Templates
265      •   Small Regulated Entities
266      •   Telehealth/Telemedicine Guidance

361   1       Introduction

362   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule [Sec. Rule]
363   specifically focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI). All HIPAA-
364   covered entities and business associates must comply with the requirements of the Security Rule.
365   Throughout this publication, covered entities and business associates will be referred to as
366   “regulated entities.” Whenever the term regulated entity or regulated entities appears, it is to
367   be understood as applying to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the
368   Security Rule.

369   1.1     Purpose and Scope

370   NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-66 aims to help educate readers about the security standards
371   included in the HIPAA Security Rule and assist regulated entities in their implementation of the
372   Security Rule. It includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for
373   regulated entities in assessing and managing risk to ePHI, identifies typical activities that a
374   regulated entity should consider when implementing an information security program, and lists
375   additional resources that regulated entities might find useful in implementing the Security Rule.

376   This publication is intended to be an aid to understanding the HIPAA Security Rule and does not
377   supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the Security Rule itself. Anyone seeking clarifications
378   of the HIPAA Security Rule should contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
379   (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the
380   HHS Security Rule website. 4

381   The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66, Rev. 2, were used in
382   preparing this document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and guidelines or updates
383   existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To remain current with the latest
384   available list of NIST security publications, the reader should periodically visit the NIST
385   Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC 5).

386   1.2     Applicability

387   The guidance provided in this publication is applicable to all covered entities and their business
388   associates of all sizes throughout the world that store, process, or transmit ePHI. While the
389   Security Rule requires regulated entities to protect ePHI, covered entities are required by the
390   Privacy Rule 6 to protect all forms of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA Privacy
391   Rule at 164.530(c)(1) states, “A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative,
392   technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.”
393   Essentially, this covers all PHI – oral, written, and electronic (to the extent not covered by the
394   Security Rule). This part of the Privacy Rule applies to covered entities, not business associates.
395   However, the business associate agreement (BAA) in place between a covered entity and
396   business associate would cover protections for all PHI. Additionally, business associates are

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                              A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

397   directly liable for impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI (i.e., a breach). A summary of a
398   business associate’s direct HIPAA liability 7 is available. Federal, state, local, and tribal
399   governments and private-sector organizations that compose the critical health infrastructure of
400   the United States are encouraged to consider using the guidance in this publication, as
401   appropriate.

402   NIST publications may be useful to any entity seeking to understand the security issues raised by
403   the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of that entity’s size, structure, or distribution of security
404   responsibilities. However, specific organizational missions, resources, and structures vary
405   greatly, and entities’ approaches to implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge
406   significantly. NIST SP 800-66 aims to assist all entities seeking further information on the
407   security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of the particular structures,
408   methodologies, and approaches used to address its requirements.

409   The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of industry-
410   developed guidelines and/or models. Organizations that choose to use this publication must
411   determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards in their
412   environments. The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not ensure or
413   guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule. This document
414   addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other provisions adopted or
415   raised by the HIPAA Rules, such as 45 CFR § 164.105. This document also does not directly
416   address provisions in the HIPAA Privacy, Breach Notification, or Enforcement Rules.

441              Subcategories and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to
442              other relevant NIST publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing
443              the Security Rule.
444         •    Appendix F – HIPAA Security Rule Resources provides an annotated, topical listing of
445              additional resources that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the
446              standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule.

447   1.4       How to Use this Document

448   Readers are encouraged to use this document as a resource for concepts and tools to assist
449   regulated entities in complying with the HIPAA Security Rule. Risk assessment and risk
450   management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s compliance with the Security Rule
451   and the protection of ePHI. For that reason, regulated entities may benefit from an initial focus
452   on Section 3 and Section 4 to build fundamental risk management processes. Section 5 may be
453   useful to regulated entities seeking activities to implement for each of the Security Rule
454   standards or for regulated entities that want sample questions to self-evaluate their protection of
455   ePHI. Regulated entities may also find value in the appendices that provide an annotated listing
456   of relevant resources, discussions of relevant topics, and a crosswalk to controls and practices
457   that may help in implementing the Security Rule.

458   This resource guide can support the compliance efforts of regulated entities in many ways,
459   including:

460         •    Ensuring that each organization is selecting security practices and controls that
461              adequately protect ePHI of which they are the steward,
462         •    Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the size and

469   2         HIPAA Security Rule

470   The HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality,
471   integrity, and availability of ePHI as defined in the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated
472   entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated
473   threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements,
474   standards, and implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following
475   regulated entities:

476         •    Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or
477              supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a
478              transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.
479         •    Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical
480              care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).
481         •    Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s
482              healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa.
483         •    Business Associate – A person or entity 9 that performs certain functions or activities that
484              involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides
485              services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for its own HIPAA Security
486              Rule violations.

487   2.1       Security Rule Goals and Objectives

488   As required by the “Security standards: General rules” section of the HIPAA Security Rule, each
489   regulated entity must:

490         •    Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI that it creates, receives,
491              maintains, or transmits;
492         •    Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity
493              of ePHI;
494         •    Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not
495              permitted by the Privacy Rule; and
496         •    Ensure compliance with the Security Rule by its workforce.

497   Regulated entities are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. Cybersecurity
498   practices will vary across organizations, depending on levels of technical understanding,
499   financial and human resources, and risk tolerance. This flexibility allows regulated entities to
500   customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements. In complying with this
501   section of the Security Rule, regulated entities must be aware of the definitions provided for
502   confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304:

503         •    Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or
504              disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.”


      9 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or

       healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.

                                                                      4

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                                A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

505         •    Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in
506              an unauthorized manner.”
507         •    Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon
508              demand by an authorized person.”

509   2.2       Security Rule Organization

510   To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar with the
511   basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards. By understanding the
512   requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it becomes easier to see which
513   resources might assist in Security Rule implementation and where to find more information. The
514   Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards and
515   implementation specifications that a regulated entity must address. 10 The six sections are listed
516   below.

517         1. Security Standards: General Rules – Includes the general requirements that all
518            regulated entities must meet, establishes flexibility of approach, identifies standards and
519            implementation specifications (both required and addressable), outlines decisions that a
520            regulated entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications, and
521            requires the maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate
522            protection of electronic protected health information.
523         2. Administrative Safeguards – Defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative actions
524            and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development, implementation, and
525            maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and
526            to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of
527            that information.”
528         3. Physical Safeguards – Defined as the “physical measures, policies, and procedures to
529            protect a covered entity’s electronic information systems and related buildings and
530            equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.”
531         4. Technical Safeguards – Defined as the “the technology and the policy and procedures
532            for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.”
533         5. Organizational Requirements – Includes standards for business associate contracts and
534            other arrangements between a covered entity and a business associate and between a
535            business associate and a subcontractor, as well as requirements for group health plans.
536         6. Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements – Requires the
537            implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the
538            standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the Security Rule;
539            the maintenance of written (may be electronic) documentation and/or records that include
540            the policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required by the Security Rule;
541            and retention, availability, and update requirements related to the documentation.



      10 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and, therefore, addressed in this document but do not

      have their own modules are Part 160 – General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164 – Security and
      Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements (discussed in Section 4 of this
      document); 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards: General rules (discussed in Section 3.1 of
      this document); and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation of the security standards.

                                                                      5
      NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd                                                          IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                               A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

542   Within the Security Rule’s sections are standards and implementation specifications. Each
543   HIPAA Security Rule standard is required. A regulated entity is required to comply with all of
544   the standards of the Security Rule with respect to all ePHI. Many of the standards contain
545   implementation specifications. See Table 1 for a listing of the Security Rule’s standards and
546   implementation specifications. An implementation specification is a more detailed description of
547   the method or approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. 11
548   Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. However, regardless of whether
549   a standard includes implementation specifications, regulated entities must comply with each
550   standard.

551       •    A required implementation specification is similar to a standard in that a regulated entity
552            must comply with it.
553       •    To meet the addressable implementation specifications, a regulated entity must (i) assess
554            whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in
555            its environment, when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting the
556            ePHI; and (ii) as applicable to the regulated entity:
557                 o (A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or
558                 o (B) if implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and
559                    appropriate—(1) document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to
560                    implement the implementation specification; and (2) implement an equivalent
561                    alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate.

562   Regulated entities are required to document these assessments and all decisions. For federal
563   agencies, all of the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most
564   likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes, missions,
565   and resources.

566   Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular
567   standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation” standards,
568   compliance with the standard itself is required.

569   Appendix E of this document provides a mapping of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and
570   implementation specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and the
571   security controls detailed in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to other relevant NIST
572   publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing the Security Rule.

577   3         Risk Assessment Guidance

578   Risk assessment and risk management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s
579   compliance with the Security Rule [Sec. Rule] and the protection of ePHI. Readers are reminded
580   of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk
581   assessment or risk management methodology. This section provides foundational information
582   about risk assessment and an approach that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing risk
583   to ePHI. Regulated entities are free to use another risk assessment methodology 13 that provides a
584   comprehensive assessment of risk to ePHI.

585   This section incorporates the risk assessment concepts and processes described in the NISTIR
586   8286 [IR 8286] series (specifically NISTIR 8286A [IR 8286A], Identifying and Estimating
587   Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management); NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Effective Use of
588   Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk [SP 800-30]; and NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk
589   Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle
590   Approach for Security and Privacy [SP 800-37]. It is intended to assist regulated entities in
591   identifying risks to ePHI.

592   The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where ePHI could be used or disclosed
593   without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed. The
594   results of the risk assessment are used to make risk management decisions on the implementation
595   of security measures required by the Security Rule to bring risk to ePHI into an organizationally
596   established risk tolerance range (i.e., reasonable and appropriate level), or if additional security
597   controls are necessary.

598   Key Terms Defined

599   When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be clearly understood. This subsection
600   defines important terms associated with risk assessment and risk management.

601         •    Threat events are circumstances or events that can have a negative impact on ePHI.
602              Threat events can be:
603                 o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent)
604                 o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error)
605         •    Threat sources refers to the intent and method targeted at causing harm to ePHI. Threat
606              sources can be:
607                 o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados),
608                 o Human (e.g., intentional, such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware authors;
609                     unintentional, such as data entry error, accidental deletions), or
610                 o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination,
611                     environmental pollution).
612         •    Vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in a system, system security procedures, internal
613              controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat event.


      13 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series of publications for more comprehensive risk assessment

          methodologies, including how to integrate ePHI risk assessment with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).

                                                                   10
      NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd                                             IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

614         •    Likelihood refers to the probability that a given threat event is capable of exploiting a
615              given vulnerability to cause harm.
616         •    Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the loss of
617              confidentiality, integrity, and/or the availability of ePHI.
618         •    Risk refers to the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or
619              event. Risk is typically a function of the likelihood and impact calculations.

620   It can be easy to confuse some of these terms, including vulnerabilities and threats. An
621   organization may determine that it is vulnerable to damage from power surges. The threat
622   sources that could exploit this vulnerability may include overloaded circuits or too much load on
623   the local grid. Other threat sources (e.g., a data entry error) may not be able to exploit this
624   vulnerability. In this example of power surges, recommended security controls could range from
625   installing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, additional fuse boxes, standby
626   generators, or even rewiring the office. These additional security controls may help to mitigate
627   the vulnerability.

628   3.1       HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements

629   Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to:

630              Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security
631              violations.

632   The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation
633   specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management:

634         1. Risk Analysis (R 14) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough
635            assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and
636            availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or
637            business associate.
638         2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to
639            reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with
640            Section 164.306(a).

641   Section 3.2 will provide a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to
642   utilize in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Section 4 will provide risk management
643   guidance.

644   3.2       How to Conduct the Risk Assessment

645   Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies. There is no single
646   methodology that will work for all regulated entities and all situations. The following steps
647   represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment process and provide an example of
648   the risk assessment methodology described in [IR 8286A] and [SP 800-30]. It is expected that


      14 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.




                                                                  11
      NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd                                                           IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:
      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                                A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

649   these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for a regulated entity. The steps
650   listed are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps could be
651   conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.

652       1. Prepare for the Assessment. Before beginning the risk assessment, the regulated entity
653          should understand where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.
654          Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where and how it enters the
655          organization (e.g., web portals), where it moves and flows within the organization (e.g.,
656          to specific information systems), where it is stored, and where ePHI leaves the
657          organization. Is ePHI transmitted to external third parties, such as cloud service providers
658          or other service providers?
659            The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a regulated
660            entity’s location and a logical boundary that covers any devices or media that contain
661            ePHI, including electronic networks through which ePHI is transmitted, regardless of its
662            location. Ensure that the risk assessment scope takes teleworkers and any remote work
663            force into consideration, including any external service providers who may have access to
664            ePHI remotely. The scope should include all removable media and portable computing
665            devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) as well as the myriad of medical devices (e.g.,
666            medical Internet of Things [IoT]) that can store, process, or transmit ePHI. Modern
667            mobile devices may not only contain ePHI but may also pose a greater risk to ePHI due
668            to theft or loss. In many ways, the risk assessment process will consider risks to ePHI as
669            it enters the organization, flows within the organization, and leaves the organization.
670            Additionally, the regulated entity should consider identifying the security controls
671            currently being used to protect ePHI.

672            This preparation step is essential to ensuring that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly
673            identified in the risk assessment process. For example, if the regulated entity does not
674            fully identify all parties or systems to which ePHI is transmitted, it may not be possible to
675            completely identify all relevant threats and vulnerabilities. The level of effort needed to
676            gather the necessary information 15 depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and
677            the size of the regulated entity.

678       2. Identify Realistic Threats. In this step, the regulated entity identifies the potential threat
679          events and threat sources that are applicable to the regulated entity and its operating
680          environment. The listing of threat events and threat sources should include realistic and
681          probable human and natural incidents that can negatively impact the regulated entity’s
682          ability to protect ePHI. Use the information gathered from the preparation step (i.e.,
683          where ePHI enters the organization, moves through the organization, is stored within the
684          organization, and leaves the organization) to identify realistic threats to ePHI. Be sure to
685          consider threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI via phishing,
686          ransomware, or insider threat.
687


      15 Regulated entities may benefit from completing a business impact analysis (BIA) to evaluate, record, and monitor the

        criticality of organizational assets, including ePHI. The BIA can help inform the determination of organizational risk tolerance
        levels, which are valuable for risk management processes. See [IR 8286A] for more information.

                                                                     12

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                                A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

688                                               Table 2 – Common Threat Sources


                   Type                                                          Examples
       Natural                            Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical

       Human                              Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings, such as
                                          unintentional acts (e.g., inadvertent data entry) or deliberate actions
                                          (e.g., network-based attacks, malicious software upload,
                                          unauthorized access to confidential information)
       Environmental                      Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak
689             Regulated entities may make use of various sources 16 when identifying relevant threats.
690             Some of the resources listed in Appendix F may help regulated entities identify common
691             threats relevant to small, medium, and large organizations. Internet searches, vendor
692             information, insurance data, and crime statistics are also viable sources of threat data.
693             Ultimately, regulated entities should identify all threats to ePHI. Examples of some
694             common threat sources are listed in Table 2. Regulated entities can also use Tables 8 to
695             10 in Appendix C as resources for identifying relevant threat events and threat sources.

696        3. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions. For any of the various
697           threats identified above to result in an impactful risk, each needs a vulnerability or
698           predisposing condition that can be exploited. The identification of vulnerabilities or
699           conditions that a threat could use to cause impact is an important component of risk
700           assessment. While it is necessary to review threats and vulnerabilities as unique elements,
701           they are often considered at the same time. Many organizations will consider a given loss
702           scenario and evaluate both. What threat sources might initiate which threat events? What
703           vulnerabilities or predisposing conditions might those threat sources exploit to cause an
704           adverse impact?
705             The regulated entity develops a list of vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be
706             exploited by potential threat sources. This list should focus on realistic technical and non-
707             technical areas where ePHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly
708             modified, or made unavailable when needed. Regulated entities should use internal and
709             external sources to identify potential vulnerabilities. Internal sources may include
710             previous risk assessments, vulnerability scan and system security test results (e.g.,
711             penetration tests), and audit reports. External sources may include internet searches,
712             vendor information, insurance data, and vulnerability databases, such as the National
713             Vulnerability Database [NIST NVD]. In Appendix F, a suggested (but not all-inclusive)
714             resource list is provided that organizations may wish to use in vulnerability identification.




      16 Regulated entities may benefit from [IR 8286A], specifically Section 2.2.2, when identifying threats to ePHI.



                                                                     13
      NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd                                              IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:

715      4. Determine the Likelihood of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. In this step, the
716         regulated entity determines the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a
717         vulnerability. For each threat event/threat source identified in step 2, consider:
718                    •   The likelihood that the threat will occur
719                    •   The likelihood that an occurred threat would exploit a vulnerability identified
720                        in step 3 to result in an adverse impact
721          A regulated entity might consider assigning a likelihood value (e.g., very low, low,
722          moderate, high, or very high) to each threat/vulnerability pairing, as shown in Table 3.
723          Regulated entities should feel free to use a different likelihood scale based on
724          organizational needs.
725          For example, a regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a tornado occurring
726          is “Low” (located along the leftmost column of Table 3) but that if it did occur, the
727          tornado would have a “Moderate” likelihood (located along the top of Table 3) of
728          exploiting a weakness in the facility’s physical structure and result in adverse impact.
729          Using Table 3, the regulated entity locates the intersection of the two individual
730          likelihood values to assign an overall likelihood of “Low” to this threat/vulnerability
731          pairing. As another example, the regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a
732          phishing attack occurring is “Very High” and that the likelihood of the event exploiting a
733          human vulnerability is “Moderate,” resulting in an overall likelihood rating of “High.”
734
735                                Table 3 – Assessment Scale for Overall Likelihood


        Likelihood

                           Very Low            Low             Moderate           High          Very High
       Initiation or
       Occurrence

        Very High            Low            Moderate             High           Very High       Very High
          High               Low            Moderate           Moderate            High         Very High
        Moderate             Low               Low             Moderate         Moderate          High
           Low             Very Low            Low               Low            Moderate        Moderate
        Very Low           Very Low         Very Low             Low               Low            Low
736

737          The regulated entity could perform this likelihood assessment for each
738          threat/vulnerability pairing. Consider that some threat events, regardless of their
739          likelihood of occurrence, may have no vulnerability to exploit, resulting in a likelihood
740          rating of “Very Low” or even “N/A.” Conversely, some identified vulnerabilities may
741          have no identified threat event that could exploit the vulnerability, also possibly resulting
742          in a likelihood rating of “N/A.”

743      5. Determine the Impact of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. The regulated entity
744         determines the impact that could occur to ePHI if a threat event exploits a vulnerability.
745         As with likelihood determination, a regulated entity may choose to express this impact in
746         qualitative terms, such as “low,” “moderate,” and “high” or using any other scale that the
747         entity chooses. When selecting an impact rating, the regulated entity may consider how
748         the threat event can affect the loss or degradation of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or
749         availability of ePHI. Table 4 provides a brief description of each security objective (i.e.,
750         confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and the impact of it not being met. The
751         regulated entity should select an impact rating for each identified threat/vulnerability pair.

752          Impact information can sometimes be obtained from existing organizational
753          documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality assessments. A business
754          impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an
755          organization’s information assets based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the
756          sensitivity and criticality of those assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and
757          prioritizes the organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems,
758          services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical missions.

759          Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue, the cost
760          of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems caused by a
761          successful threat action. Other impacts – such as the loss of public confidence, the loss of
762          credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest – cannot be measured in specific units
763          but can be qualified or described in terms of “high,” “moderate,” and “low” impacts, for
764          example. Qualitative and quantitative methods can both be used to determine the impact
765          of a threat event exploiting a vulnerability to cause an adverse impact. Regulated entities
766          may consult Table 5 to assist in identifying potential adverse impact and to subsequently
767          assign an impact rating to each threat/vulnerability pair.
768                                 Table 4. Security Objectives and Impacts

         Security Objective                                      Impacts

       Loss of Confidentiality    System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of
                                  information from unauthorized disclosure (i.e., the data or
                                  information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized
                                  persons or processes). The impact of an unauthorized disclosure of
                                  confidential information can range from the jeopardizing of
                                  national security to the disclosure of Privacy Act data.
                                  Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional disclosure could
                                  result in the loss of public confidence, embarrassment, or legal
                                  action against the organization.

       Loss of Integrity          System and data integrity refers to the requirement that information
                                  be protected from improper modification (i.e., data or information
                                  have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner).
                                  Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or
                                  system by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system

         Security Objective                                         Impacts
                                   or data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the contaminated
                                   system or corrupted data could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or
                                   erroneous decisions. Also, the violation of integrity may be the first
                                   step in a successful attack against system availability or
                                   confidentiality. For all of these reasons, the loss of integrity reduces
                                   the assurance of a system.

       Loss of Availability        Availability refers to the requirement that data or information is
                                   accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person or
                                   process. If a mission-critical system is unavailable to its end users,
                                   the organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system
                                   functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may result
                                   in the loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’
                                   performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s
                                   mission.

771      6. Determine the Level of Risk. The regulated entity assesses the level of risk to ePHI,
772         considering the information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps.
773         The level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the overall likelihood
774         of threat occurrence (i.e., step 4) and the resulting impact of threat occurrence (i.e., step
775         5). A risk-level matrix, such as the samples depicted in Table 6 and Table 7, can be used
776         to assist in determining risk levels for each threat event/vulnerability pair. Regulated
777         entities can use a different risk matrix that aligns with the ratings scales used for
778         likelihood and impact in steps 4 and 5.
779          To clarify the use of the risk matrix, consider the examples presented in step 4. For the
780          tornado threat event, the overall likelihood was assigned a rating of “Low.” However, the
781          impact of this threat event could easily be assigned a rating of “High.” Using the matrix
782          in Table 6, the intersection of “Low” likelihood and “High” impact results in an overall
783          risk rating of “Low.” For the phishing threat example, the overall likelihood was rated
784          “High.” If the regulated entity determined that the impact of a phishing threat was likely
785          to be “Moderate,” this would result in an overall risk rating of “Moderate.” The
786          regulated entity should determine the level of risk for each identified threat/vulnerability
787          pair.

791         7. Document the Risk Assessment Results. Once the risk assessment has been completed
792            (i.e., threat events, threat sources, and vulnerabilities identified; likelihood and impact
793            ratings calculated; and risk levels determined), the results of the risk assessment should
794            be documented. Regulated entities may benefit from documenting the risk assessment
795            results in a risk register. 17 Appendix K of NIST [SP 800-30] provides a sample risk
796            assessment report outline that may prove useful to regulated entities. Other entities may
797            prefer to input the risk assessment results into a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)
798            or enterprise risk management (ERM) tool. Principally, the regulated entity should
799            document all threat/vulnerability pairs (i.e., a scenario in which an identified threat can
800            exploit a vulnerability) applicable to the organization, the likelihood and impact
801            calculations, and the overall risk to ePHI for the threat/vulnerability pair.

802   3.3     Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management

803   The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk
804   management strategy (presented in Section 4). To that end, regulated entities should not view
805   risk assessment as a one-time, static task but rather as an ongoing activity. Threats change, and


      17 OMB Circular A-11 [OMB A-11] defines a risk register as “a repository of risk information including the data understood

        about risks over time.” The risk register provides a formal communication vehicle for sharing and coordinating cybersecurity
        risk activities. Regulated entities can learn more about risk registers in [IR 8286A].


                                                                    18

806   some identified vulnerabilities may be remediated while new vulnerabilities appear. The
807   regulated entity may implement policies or procedures that reduce the likelihood and/or impact
808   of a threat event. This dynamic environment requires the risk assessment to be updated on a
809   periodic basis in order for risks to be properly identified, documented, and subsequently
810   managed.

811   Risk Assessment Resources

812   Regulated entities may find the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool [SRA Tool] helpful
813   in getting started with a risk assessment. The SRA tool was primarily developed to assist small
814   and medium sized regulated entities. The SRA Tool is a questionnaire that guides a regulated
815   entity through many of the same risk assessment steps described in this section. In that sense, it
816   is meant to be used in conjunction with the risk assessment guidance above. Regulated entities
817   should be aware that, as a questionnaire, there are some things that the SRA tool cannot do. It
818   cannot identify technical vulnerabilities. It is suggested to pair the SRA tool – or any
819   questionnaire tool – with a methodology that could identify technical vulnerabilities (e.g.,
820   vulnerability scanning or a vulnerability management program). Software such as the SRA tool
821   will provide output only as good as the information put into the tool. For that reason, regulated
822   entities should follow established risk assessment methodology even when using tools for risk
823   assessment. Regulated entities should also be aware that use of the SRA Tool or any risk
824   assessment/management tool does not necessarily equate with compliance to the HIPAA
825   Security Rule.

826   Regulated entities may find additional resources in Appendix F that can assist in the risk
827   assessment process.

828   4       Risk Management Guidance

829   The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provide the foundation of a regulated
830   entity’s Security Rule [Sec. Rule] compliance efforts. Readers are reminded of the Security
831   Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or
832   risk management methodology. This section provides background information about risk
833   management as well as an approach from [IR 8286] that regulated entities may choose to use in
834   managing risk to ePHI. Regulated entities, however, are free to use another risk management
835   methodology 18 that effectively protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

836   All ePHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a regulated entity is subject to the
837   Security Rule. Regulated entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate security
838   measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
839   integrity, and availability of ePHI. Risk management should be performed with regular
840   frequency to examine past decisions, reevaluate risk likelihood and impact levels, and assess the
841   effectiveness of past remediation efforts.

842   4.1     HIPAA Risk Management Requirements

843   Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to:

844             Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security
845             violations.

846   The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation
847   specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management.

848         1. Risk Analysis (R 19) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough
849            assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and
850            availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or
851            business associate.
852         2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to
853            reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with
854            Section 164.306(a).

855   Section 3.2 provided a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to utilize
856   in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). This section provides risk management guidance in
857   accordance with 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B).

858   4.2     Risk Analysis

859   Regulated entities are required to assess risks and vulnerabilities in their environments and to
860   implement security controls to address those risks and vulnerabilities. Once the risk assessment
861   has been completed and documented, the regulated entity will have a listing of applicable

      18 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series for more comprehensive risk management methodologies,

          including how to integrate ePHI risk management with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).
      19 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.

863   integrity, and availability of ePHI. Some threat/vulnerability pairs may indicate a moderate or
864   high level of risk to ePHI, while others may indicate a low level of risk to ePHI. The regulated
865   entity will need to determine what risk rating poses an unacceptable level of risk to ePHI.

                                      Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance
        NISTIR 8286A presents two concepts – risk appetite and risk tolerance – that may be helpful
        to regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI. Risk appetite regarding cybersecurity risks is
        declared at the enterprise (i.e., highest) level of the organization and provides a guidepost to
        the types and amount of risk, on a broad level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in
        pursuit of mission objectives. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance
        risk deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership. Regulated entities
        may choose to express risk tolerance qualitatively (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High,
        or Very High) in alignment with the guidance presented in Section 3.

        Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct. Where risk appetite statements define
        the overarching risk guidance, risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that
        direction. This means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the
        corresponding risk appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements
        represent risk limits that can assist regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.
866
867   A regulated entity’s leadership may indicate that organizational risk tolerance is “Medium” and
868   that all risks to ePHI must be brought within that level or below. Any threat/vulnerability pairs
869   that indicate a threat rating above the organizational risk tolerance will need to be addressed. For
870   example, if using a scale of “low,” “moderate,” and “high,” the regulated entity may determine
871   that any moderate or high level of risk to ePHI is unacceptable and must be remediated.

872   Once a regulated entity implements the standards, required implementation specifications, and
873   addressable 20 implementation specifications in accordance with the Security Rule, the regulated
874   entity should determine whether the risks to ePHI have been sufficiently addressed. That is, do
875   the implemented standards and implementation specifications reduce the risk of the
876   threat/vulnerability pairs that were deemed unacceptably high to levels that are within the
877   organizational risk tolerance?

878   As an example, a regulated entity’s risk assessment may have identified ransomware attacks to
879   pose a high level of risk to ePHI (i.e., High likelihood rating and High impact rating). After
880   implementing two required implementation specifications – Data Backup Plan
881   [(164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)] and Disaster Recovery Plan [164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B)] – the regulated entity
882   reassesses that the level of risk due to ransomware attacks has been reduced to Low. The
883   likelihood of a ransomware attack may still be rated High, but the two required implementation
884   specifications have helped reduce the impact rating to Low, resulting in an overall risk rating that


      20 Regulated entities should consult Section 2.2 and/or the [Sec. Rule] § 164.306(d) for additional information about addressable

           implementation specifications and how to adequately implement them in the regulated entity’s environment.

                                                                     21

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                                                A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

885   is within organizational risk tolerance. Another regulated entity may have determined during a
886   risk assessment that loss of confidentiality of ePHI during transmission to an external party is an
887   unacceptably high risk (i.e., outside of established risk tolerance). However, the regulated entity
888   has determined that the implemented standards and implementation specifications still do not
889   reduce the risk to levels that are within organizational risk tolerance and that additional controls
890   are needed 21.

891   This process of risk analysis should be completed for each threat/vulnerability pair to determine
892   whether the implemented standards and implementation specifications have reduced risk to ePHI
893   to levels within the organizational risk tolerance level. Ultimately, the regulated entity’s risk
894   analysis processes should inform its decisions regarding the implementation of security measures
895   sufficient to reduce risks to ePHI to levels within organizational risk tolerance. Each regulated
896   entity must document 22 the security controls determined to be reasonable and appropriate,
897   including analyses, decisions, and the rationale for decisions made to refine or adjust the security
898   controls.

899   4.3     Selecting Additional Security Controls to Reduce Risk to ePHI

900   A regulated entity may determine that there are identified risks to ePHI that cannot be brought
901   within established risk tolerance by any standards, required implementation specifications, or
902   addressable implementation specifications in the Security Rule. In such a situation, the regulated
903   entity should consider implementing additional security controls 23 to reduce the risk to ePHI to
904   established risk tolerance. Appendix E provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards
905   and implementation specifications, mapping each to relevant [NIST CSF] Subcategory outcomes
906   and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. Regulated entities may benefit from the mapping to
907   identify desired cybersecurity outcomes, as well as SP 800-53 management, operational, or
908   technical controls that can reduce the risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance.

909   Many organizations implement a variety of technical and non-technical controls separate from
910   the protection of ePHI. These controls may consist of policies, processes, or technology. A
911   thorough understanding of the entirety of security controls in place for a regulated entity may
912   reduce the list of applicable vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability of a threat
913   exploiting a vulnerability. Regulated entities should be sure to evaluate all technical and non-
914   technical security controls at all places where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed,
915   or transmitted. This evaluation should determine whether these additional security measures
916   implemented or planned are adequate to protect ePHI and reduce risk to ePHI to established risk
917   tolerance. The appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the
918   structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity.



      21 See Section 4.3 for additional discussion.
      22 Regulated entities should consider documenting these decisions in the risk register or wherever the risk assessment results were

        documented. See Section 4.4.
      23 It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be implemented to reduce risk. To determine which

        are required and appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted for the proposed
        recommended controls to demonstrate that the costs of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level
        of risk. In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and feasibility of introducing the
        recommended security controls into the operating environment.

                                                                     22

      INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT                                              A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE

919   For some threats and/or vulnerabilities, the regulated entity may determine that the risk to ePHI
920   cannot be brought within established risk tolerance through any standards, implementation
921   specifications, or additional security controls. In this case, the regulated entity’s leadership may
922   choose to revisit the established risk tolerance. The resulting discussions present an opportunity
923   for leadership to determine the best course of action to refine risk acceptance and tolerance in
924   light of mission objectives (e.g., through a risk exception process, an adjustment to the risk
925   tolerance statement, or increased security requirements). However, if an unacceptable level of
926   risk to ePHI cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective manner, that risk should be avoided.
927   Such a condition may require significantly redesigning relevant systems or processes that handle
928   ePHI.

929   4.4   Documenting Risk Management Activities

930   As with the risk assessment, the risk management activities should be documented. The
931   regulated entity may build on the documentation developed during the risk assessment by
932   indicating how threat/vulnerability pairs with risk levels above established risk tolerance are
933   mitigated or avoided. Some regulated entities may choose to document their risk management
934   activities through a risk register that records assessment findings, remediation plans, timelines,
935   responsible parties, etc. Other regulated entities may choose to utilize free or commercially
936   available tools to document their risk management activities. The documentation and retention of
937   risk assessment and risk management activities may be important for future risk management
938   efforts.

939   5       Considerations When Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule

940   This section presents security measures that are relevant to each standard of the Security Rule.
941   Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format. The following tables, organized by
942   HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standard, are designed to initiate the thought process for
943   regulated entities to implement the requirements of the Security Rule. These tables highlight
944   considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule; they are not meant to
945   be prescriptive. The tables should also not be considered comprehensive for all considerations
946   when implementing the Security Rule.

947   In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the
948   following information:

949       •    Key Activities – The Key Activities column lists actions that are often associated with
950            the security functions suggested by each HIPAA Security Rule standard. Some of these
951            key activities are also the implementation specifications for that standard. Each key
952            activity that is also an implementation specification has been identified as such in the
953            table (in italics in the Description section of the table) along with a note as to whether the
954            implementation specification is required or addressable.

955            Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not
956            specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is
957            in no way meant to expand upon the requirements of the Security Rule. Many of these
958            activities, however, are often included in a robust security process and may be useful to
959            regulated entities. These activities may also normally be performed as part of one or more
960            of the standard’s implementation specifications. For clarity, these activities are listed as
961            separate key activities with a footnote explaining any relationship to associated
962            implementation specifications.

963            The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation
964            specifications, both required and addressable. Seven of the standards include all of the
965            necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation
966            specifications. In these instances, the standards themselves also serve as the
967            implementation specification. As noted earlier in this document, even if there are no
968            implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned
969            Security Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still
970            required.

971            The listed key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be additional
972            activities that an organization will need to consider specific to its own operations that are
973            not included in the key activities of the tables. Each regulated entity will need to identify
974            which activities beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its
975            environment, implement those activities, and document them.

976            The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised
977            by the HIPAA Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities,
978            readers may consult the crosswalk presented in Appendix E. The crosswalk lists, for each

 979          Security Rule standard, one or more relevant NIST publications that could provide more
 980          context or information.

 981      •   Description – The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation
 982          about the key activities. The descriptions include the types of activities that a regulated
 983          entity may pursue in implementing a standard. These explanations are designed to help
 984          get an entity started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description bullet
 985          of each key activity that is also an implementation specification is in italics. When a
 986          relationship exists between description bullets and other Security Rule standards or
 987          implementation specifications, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.
 988
 989      •   Sample Questions – This column includes questions that a regulated entity may ask
 990          itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately implemented. These sample
 991          questions are not exhaustive but are representative of the questions that a regulated entity
 992          may find helpful when implementing the Security Rule and implementation
 993          specifications. Affirmative answers to these questions do not necessarily imply that an
 994          entity is meeting all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards. Negative
 995          answers to these questions should prompt the regulated entity to consider whether it
 996          needs to take further action to comply with the standards. It is possible that organizations
 997          with existing information security programs will have considered many of the sample
 998          questions. The questions that an organization asks in implementing the Security Rule
 999          should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.

1000   This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational
1001   Requirements, in detail as it does not set out general security principles. HIPAA-regulated
1002   entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further
1003   guidance if needed.

1004   Readers are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The following key activities,
1005   descriptions, and sample questions are meant to be informative, not prescriptive. This flexibility
1006   allows regulated entities to customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements.
1007   Regulated entities should customize the key activities, descriptions, and sample questions to best
1008   fit their organization.

1009   Each regulated entity (i.e., covered entity or business associate) is responsible for its own
1010   Security Rule compliance and violations and should therefore review the following key
1011   activities, descriptions, and sample questions through the lens of its own organization.

1052    5.1.9    Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements (§ 164.308(b)(1)) 75

1053    HIPAA Standard: A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected
1054    health information on the covered entity’s behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §
1055    164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such
1056    satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

1057    Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor
1058    management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to
1059    organizations. However, to the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as
1060    covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written
1061    satisfactory assurances that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their
1062    business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These
1063    requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

1107   5.4.1    Business Associate Contracts or Other Arrangements (§ 164.314(a))

1108   HIPAA Standard: (i) The contract or other arrangement between the covered entity and its business associate required by §
1109   164.308(b)(3) must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable. (ii) A covered
1110   entity is in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it has another arrangement in place that meets the requirements of §
1111   164.504(e)(3). (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section apply to the contract or other arrangement
1112   between a business associate and a subcontractor required by § 164.308(b)(4) in the same manner as such requirements apply to
1113   contracts or other arrangements between a covered entity and business associate.

1114   Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor
1115   management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to
1116   organizations. To the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered
1117   entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory
1118   assurances from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more
1119   of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a BAA. These requirements would need to
1120   be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

        [Sec. Rule, §164.306(d)(3)]    covered entity or business associate must (i) assess whether
                                       each implementation specification is a reasonable and
                                       appropriate safeguard in its environment, when analyzed with
                                       reference to the likely contribution to protecting the electronic
                                       protected health information; and (ii) as applicable to the
                                       covered entity or business associate - (A) Implement the

1421   Section 3 of this publication provides foundational information about risk assessment as well as
1422   an approach that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing risk to ePHI. As part of a risk
1423   assessment, regulated entities should identify realistic and probable threats that can have a
1424   negative impact on the regulated entity’s ability to protect ePHI. Identifying realistic threat
1425   sources and threat events may not be easy for regulated entities. The tables in this appendix
1426   appear in [SP 800-30] and could be helpful in identifying threat sources and threat events as part
1427   of a risk assessment.

1435                   National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program

1436   In a general sense, an informative reference, sometimes called a mapping, indicates how one
1437   document relates to another document. In the [NIST CSF], for example, six informative
1438   references were included (as shown in Figure 1) although many other informative references
1439   could have been useful to stakeholders. While the concept of informative references was well
1440   received, the static nature of the Cybersecurity Framework and other NIST documents that
1441   include informative references meant that some of its informative references became outdated as
1442   the documents they referenced were updated.




1443
                       Figure 1 - Informative References Included in Cybersecurity Framework
1444
1445   Within the context of the National Online Informative References [NIST OLIR] Program, an
1446   informative reference indicates the relationship(s) between the elements of two documents. The
1447   source document, called the Focal Document, is used as the basis for the document comparison.
1448   The second document is called the Reference Document. Note that a Focal Document or a
1449   Reference Document is not necessarily in a traditional document format (e.g., a formal
1450   publication in PDF format) but could be a product, service, or training. A Focal Document
1451   Element or a Reference Document Element is a discrete section, sentence, phrase, or other
1452   identifiable piece of content of a document.

1453   The OLIR Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts (SMEs) in defining
1454   standardized relationships between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce
1455   documents (Reference Documents) and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce
1456   documents (Focal Documents), like the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and NIST [SP
1457   800-53], Rev. 5. By removing the informative references from within the NIST documents, the
1458   OLIR program scales to accommodate a greater number of informative references while
1459   providing a more agile model for updating the relationships between elements of the Reference
1460   and Focal Documents.

1461   The National OLIR Program provides an online catalog for displaying, sharing, and comparing
1462   informative references. The National OLIR Program offers several benefits, including:

1463      •   Provides a single, easy-to-use repository where people can obtain information on many
1464          Reference Documents and analyze their relationships
1465      •   Increases the transparency, alignment, and harmonization of definitions and concepts
1466          across Reference Documents
1467      •   Standardizes how References are expressed – making them more consistent, clear, usable,
1468          repeatable, and organizable – and provides a way for automation technologies to ingest
1469          and utilize them
1470      •   Provides the ability to authenticate the source of each Reference and allows users to
1471          identify whether the Reference was provided by a verified SME
1472      •   Employs mathematical rigor (e.g., standard set theory principles, such as subset, superset,
1473          equal, intersect, and discrete logic) to express References rather than merely relying on
1474          prose, which can be ambiguous and subjective
1475      •   Allows for the cybersecurity and privacy community to keep information current on
1476          relationship assertions between Reference Documents and Focal Documents

1477   Before the National OLIR Program, a person analyzing documents was often forced to conduct a
1478   manual comparison, typically by copying the contents of both documents into a spreadsheet for
1479   easier searching and sorting. To save time, an analyst might try to leverage existing document
1480   mappings from SMEs. This laborious and error-prone process would be repeated for all of the
1481   elements within the Focal Document and the Reference Document. Multiply this process by
1482   numerous analysts performing the task, and two problems quickly emerge: 1) the different
1483   opinions of analysts result in inconsistent associations, and 2) the analysts duplicate an enormous
1484   amount of effort. Streamlining this process is the main reason the OLIR Derived Relationship
1485   Mappings (DRM) capability was created.

1486   DRMs are the result of using the relationships between Reference Documents and a Focal
1487   Document to make inferences about relationships between the Reference Documents. For
1488   example, the OLIR catalog contains an informative reference that maps elements of the
1489   Cybersecurity Framework to elements in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. Another informative
1490   reference maps elements of the Cybersecurity Framework to elements in two versions of the
1491   HITRUST CSF [HITRUST]. A DRM can be created that depicts the relationships between the
1492   two Reference Documents: NIST SP 800-53, Rev.5 and the HITRUST CSF. These DRMs can be
1493   dynamically generated on the OLIR website.

1494   With much of the relationship data already defined by the SME, a user can simply generate a full
1495   report between two Reference Documents and export it to a comma-separated values format. The
1496   user can sort the reference data by Functions, Categories, Subcategories, Control Families,
1497   Security/Privacy Controls, or Security Control Enhancements (depending on the Focal
1498   Document selected). The user can then better understand the similarities and differences between
1499   the elements and determine which relationships are relevant for their purposes.

1500   In the context of HIPAA compliance, Table 12 in Appendix E lists mappings between elements
1501   of the Security Rule (i.e., standards and implementation specifications); elements of SP 800-53,
1502   Rev. 5 (i.e., security and privacy controls); and elements of the Cybersecurity Framework (i.e.,

1504   determine relationships to elements in a wide variety of other Reference Documents (e.g.,
1505   controls catalogs, standards, practices) that may help them comply with the Security Rule and
1506   improve their organizational cybersecurity posture.

1509   This appendix provides a listing of the HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standards and
1510   implementation specifications within the Administrative (§ 164.308), Physical (§ 164.310), and
1511   Technical (§ 164.312) Safeguards sections, as well as the Organizational Requirements (§

1513   Additionally, this appendix crosswalks or maps those Security Rule standards and
1514   implementation specifications to applicable security controls detailed in NIST [SP 800-53], to
1515   the Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories, and to NIST publications that are
1516   relevant to each Security Rule standard. Readers may draw upon these NIST publications and
1517   mappings for consideration in implementing the Security Rule.

1518   The catalog is organized according to the categorization of standards within each of the
