1.       Executive Summary

The physical access control systems (PACS) deployed in most Federal buildings are facility-
centric rather than enterprise-centric and utilize proprietary PACS architectures. Therefore, many
issued identification (ID) cards operate only with the PACS for which they were issued. The
technologies used in these systems may offer little or no authentication assurance, because the
issued ID cards are easily cloned or counterfeited. In addition to the lack of interoperability,
deployed PACS technology presents the following challenges:

     +    Scalability. Some deployed systems are limited in their capability to process the longer
          credential numbers necessary for Government-wide interoperability.

     +    Security. Deployed PACS readers can read an identifying number from a card, but in
          most cases they do not perform a cryptographic challenge/response exchange. Most bar
          code, magnetic stripe, and proximity cards can be copied easily. The technologies used
          in these systems may offer little or no authentication assurance.

     +    Validity. Deployed PACS control expiration of credentials through an expiration date
          stored in a site database. There is no simple way to synchronize the expiration or
          revocation of credentials for a Federal employee or contractor across multiple sites.

     +    Efficiency. Use of personal identification numbers (PIN), public key infrastructure, and
          biometrics with deployed PACS is managed on a site-specific basis. Individuals must
          enroll PINs, keys, and biometrics at each site. Since PINs, keys, and biometrics are often
          stored in a site database, they may not be technically interoperable with PACS at other
          sites.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) sets a clear goal to improve PACS
through the use of government-wide standards. [HSPD-12] Federal Information Processing
Standard 201 (FIPS 201) defines characteristics of the identity credential that can be interoperable
government-wide. [FIPS201] In the context of HSPD-12, the term interoperability means the
ability to use any Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card with any application performing one
or more PIV authentication mechanisms. FIPS 201 defines authentication mechanisms at three E-
Authentication assurance levels (SOME, HIGH, and VERY HIGH), and standardizes optional
credential elements that extend trust in the PIV System to functions beyond authentication. A gap
remains, however, between the concepts of authentication assurance levels and their application
in a PACS environment. To close this gap, this document:

     +    Discusses the different PIV Card capabilities so that the risk-based assessment can be
          aligned with the appropriate PIV authentication mechanism.

     +    Introduces the concept of “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas to employ risk-based
          PIV authentication mechanisms for different areas within a facility.

     +    Proposes a PIV Implementation Maturity Model (PIMM) to measure the progress of
          facility and agency implementations.

     +    Recommends to Federal agencies an overall strategy for the implementation of PIV
          authentication mechanisms with agency facility PACS.



                                                                                            Page 1
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



Since the areas accessible via different access points within a facility do not all have the same
security requirement, the PIV authentication mechanisms should be selected to be consistent with,
and integral to, the overall security requirements of the protected area. A given facility may need
multiple authentication mechanisms. Therefore, the designation of “Controlled, Limited,
Exclusion” areas, detailed in Section 7.3, is applied to the protected area. Specifically, this
document recommends PIV authentication mechanisms for “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” in
terms of authentication factors as shown in Table 1-1.

                          Table 1-1. Authentication Factors for Security Areas

                Security Areas         Number of Authentication Factors Required
                Controlled             1
                Limited                2
                Exclusion              3

PIV authentication mechanisms should be implemented in accordance with Table 1-1. Figure 1-1
illustrates the innermost perimeter at which each PIV authentication mechanism may be used
based on the authentication assurance level of the mechanism. The combined effect of Table 1-1
and Figure 1-1 determines exactly what mechanisms may be used. (See Section 7.3) An
exhaustive list of possible uses of PIV authentication mechanisms against protected areas is
provided in Appendix C.
Visual (VIS), Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID), Biometric (BIO), Attended Biometric
(BIO-A), and PIV Authentication Key (PKI) are PIV authentication mechanisms defined in FIPS
201 and described in Section 3. Card Authentication Key (CAK) is an optional PIV
authentication mechanism that is described in Section 3.

A risk-based migration strategy should be planned and implemented to achieve PIV enabling.
This document recommends a model that allows agencies to incrementally PIV-enable access
points. The model is defined in terms of maturity levels as follows:

    +   Maturity Level 1—Ad hoc PIV verification.

    +   Maturity Level 2—Systematic PIV verification to Controlled areas. PIV Cards and
        currently deployed non-PIV PACS cards are accepted for access to the Controlled areas
        at this level.

    +   Maturity Level 3—Access to Exclusion areas by PIV or exception only. Non-PIV PACS
        cards are not accepted for access to the Exclusion areas at this level.

    +   Maturity Level 4—Access to Limited areas by PIV or exception only. Non-PIV PACS
        cards are not accepted for access to the Limited or Exclusion areas at this level.

    +   Maturity Level 5—Access to Controlled areas by PIV or exception only. Non-PIV PACS
        cards are not accepted for access to any areas at this level.

2.2       Background
HSPD-12 mandates the establishment of a government-wide standard for identity credentials to
improve physical security in Federally controlled facilities 2 . To that end, HSPD-12 requires all
government employees and contractors be issued a new identity credential based on the FIPS 201
on PIV. Following FIPS 201, this credential is referred to herein as a PIV Card 3 .
HSPD-12 explicitly requires the use of PIV Cards “in gaining physical access to Federally
controlled facilities and logical access to Federally controlled information systems.” [HSPD-12]
The PIV Card employs microprocessor-based smart card technology, and is designed to be
counterfeit-resistant, tamper-resistant, and interoperable across Federal government facilities.
Additionally, the FIPS 201 standards suite defines the authentication mechanisms as transactions
between a PIV Card and a relying party. FIPS 201 does not, however, elaborate on the uses and
applications of the PIV Card. This document provides guidelines on the uses of PIV Cards with
PACS.
The PACS technologies deployed in most Federal buildings are facility-centric rather than
enterprise-centric and utilize proprietary PACS architectures. Historically, a security advantage
was seen in not having the design of the security system published or readily accommodating
substitution. For this and other reasons, many deployed PACS are not interoperable. Moreover,

    In particular, whenever a PACS uses cryptographic mechanisms, FIPS 140-2 and NIST SP 800-57 may apply.

 Federally controlled facilities as defined in Section 1D of OMB Memorandum M-05-24.

 Federal agencies may refer to PIV Cards by other names, for example, “identity badges” or “access cards”. In this
document, all such credentials issued by an accredited PIV Card Issuer are called PIV Cards.



                                                                                                            Page 4
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



lack of agency card technology standards and current credential numbering systems are the
factors that limit interoperability across agencies. In other words, an identity credential issued by
one PACS may not have the capability to be used by another. To enhance security and promote
interoperability, it is essential to develop an efficient and cost-effective strategy to migrate PACS
to standardized methods as defined in FIPS 201. The application of cryptographic authentication
and integrity methods allows the security of authentication to be improved, the design of
authentication to rely on open standards, and the need for secrecy regarding authentication to be
concentrated on cryptographic keys.
Full compliance with HSPD-12, and the use of PIV authentication mechanisms for access to
Federal facilities and systems as required by HSPD-12, should be the principal goals of a
department or agency implementation plan. Recognizing that implementation will take time,
migration goals and plans should be developed to PIV-enable PACS installations, while meeting
continuity of operations and resource constraints. Plans may include change management
strategies such as:

      +    The use of "multi-technology" readers, enabling a transition to the PIV-enabled PACS
           over time by allowing proprietary identity cards and PIV Cards to work side-by-side.

      +    Retrofit or upgrade the existing PACS to use PIV Cards.

      +    Coexistence of PIV-enabled and existing PACS in leased multi-tenant facilities.
           Recommendation: The OMB Memorandum [M-08-01] requires that the
           credential issuance be accomplished by October 27, 2008 (or by the date specified
           in the implementation plan mutually agreed-upon by the agency and OMB).
           Agency implementation plans should be written to accomplish the goals of HSPD-
           12.

2.3       Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to describe a strategy allowing agencies to PIV-enable their
PACS, and migrate to government-wide interoperability. Specifically, the document
recommends a risk-based approach for selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms to
manage physical access to Federal government facilities and assets. With the intent to facilitate
and encourage greater use of PIV Cards, this document:

      +    Describes the desired characteristics of a target implementation of PIV-enabled PACS.

      +    Describes trust and infrastructure challenges that must be overcome to achieve
           government-wide credential interoperability.

      +    Discusses the PIV Card capabilities so that risk-based assessment can be aligned with the
           appropriate PIV authentication mechanism.

      +    Recommends to Federal agencies an overall strategy for the implementation of PIV
           authentication mechanisms with agency facility PACS.

      +    Proposes a PIMM to measure the progress of facility and agency implementations.
As stated above, this document focuses on the use of PIV Cards to gain access to Federal
buildings and facilities. This document does not address non-PIV authentication mechanisms.

Although the ergonomic design of PACS components is outside the scope of this publication, the
1998 Amendment to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act has special relevance to PACS
components. [SECTION508] PACS access controls are intended to be unavoidable. Section 508
should be considered early during projects that integrate the PIV System with PACS. Section 508
should be considered as it applies to enrollment software, smart card and biometric readers,
monitoring systems, and access control point sensors and actuators. Note that FIPS 201, Section
4.4.1, states that an alternative to BIO or BIO-A authentication mechanism should be used if one
or more fingers cannot be enrolled. Further information can be found at [SECTION508], in
[FIPS201], and in [SP800-76].
Many other aspects of physical access control are outside the scope of this publication.
Authorization (i.e., granting permission within a PACS for an identified person to pass access
control points) is a critical security function, but is out of scope for the PIV System. Other out-
of-scope functions include area protection, intrusion detection, monitoring and tracking (other
than at access control points), and enforcement of access control decisions. It is understood that
PACS may also be integrated with surveillance systems, fire control systems, evacuation systems,
etc., within a facility. This document does not address the integration of PACS with other
facility-centric information technology (IT) systems, although it has been written to minimize
conflicts during such integration. Therefore, if the integration of the measures outlined in this
document creates a life-safety risk, organizations will need to mitigate these risks before applying
the measures.
The evaluation of specific PACS architectures or implementations is also outside the scope of this
publication, as is the standardization of PACS. The creation of specific migration plans for each
agency and facility is also not the intent of this document, although it offers advice on the
construction of such plans. Unless normatively referenced, this document is a best practice
guideline.
        Recommendation: This document recommends a risk-based approach for
        selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms to manage physical access to
        Federal government facilities and assets. Agencies should seek recommendations
        on PACS architectures, authorization, and facility protection from other sources.

2.4   Audience
This document is intended for the government officials responsible for implementing HSPD-12.
This document will also aid government executives (i.e., decision makers) to evaluate business
cases and develop strategies for their departments or agencies. Information in this document is
also useful to the government contractors and security industry vendors implementing HSPD-12-
related systems, products, and services.

3.    Terminology
The following terms are used in this document and are not defined in FIPS 201.
Access Control: A function or a system that restricts access to authorized persons only.
Access Control List: A list of (identifier, permissions) pairs associated with a resource or an
asset. As an expression of security policy, a person may perform an operation on a resource or
asset if and only if the person’s identifier is present in the access control list (explicitly or
implicitly), and the permissions in the (identifier, permissions) pair include the permission to
perform the requested operation.
Assurance Level (or E-Authentication Assurance Level): A measure of trust or confidence in
an authentication mechanism defined in OMB Memorandum M-04-04 and NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-63, in terms of four levels: [M-04-04]
            •    Level 1: LITTLE OR NO confidence
            •    Level 2: SOME confidence
            •    Level 3: HIGH confidence
            •    Level 4: VERY HIGH confidence
Authentication: A process that establishes the origin of information, or determines an entity’s
identity. In this publication, authentication often means the performance of a PIV authentication
mechanism.
Authentication in Context: Authentication in context is a concept in which PACS may benefit
from previous authentication within nested areas in a facility. The PACS may use information
from previous access control decisions (“context”) when making a new access control decision.
Authorization: In this publication, a process that associates permission to access a resource or
asset with a person and the person’s identifier(s).
Authenticator: A memory, possession, or quality of a person that can serve as proof of identity,
when presented to a verifier of the appropriate kind. For example, passwords, cryptographic
keys, and fingerprints are authenticators.
BIO or BIO-A: A FIPS 201 authentication mechanism that is implemented by using a
Fingerprint data object sent from the PIV Card to the PACS. Note that the short-hand “BIO (-A)”
is used throughout the document to represent both BIO and BIO-A authentication mechanisms.
Biometric: An authenticator produced from measurable qualities of a living person.
Building Security Committee: A committee consisting of representatives of Federal tenants in a
facility, and possibly the building owner or management. The committee is responsible for
building-specific security issues and approval of security policies and practices.
Card Authentication Key (CAK): A PIV authentication mechanism (or the PIV Card key of
the same name) that is implemented by an asymmetric or symmetric key challenge/response
protocol. The CAK is an optional mechanism defined in NIST SP 800-73. [SP800-73] NIST
strongly recommends that every PIV Card contain an asymmetric CAK and corresponding
certificate, and that agencies use the asymmetric CAK protocol, rather than a symmetric CAK
protocol, whenever the CAK authentication mechanism is used with PACS. See Section 7.1.4.




                                                                                            Page 7
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID): A FIPS 201 authentication mechanism that is
implemented by transmission of the CHUID data object from the PIV Card to PACS, or the PIV
Card data object of the same name.
Certificate: A data object containing a subject identifier, a public key, and other information,
that is digitally signed by a Certification Authority. Certificates convey trust in the relationship
of the subject identifier to the public key.
Cloning: In this publication, a process to create a verbatim copy of a PIV Card, or a partial copy
sufficient to perform one or more authentication mechanisms as if it were the original card.
Contact Reader: A smart card reader that communicates with the Integrated Circuit chip in a
smart card using electrical signals on wires touching the smart card’s contact pad. The PIV
contact interface is standardized by International Organization of Standards / International
Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 7816-3. [ISO/IEC7816]
Contactless Reader: A smart card reader that communicates with the Integrated Circuit chip in
a smart card using radio frequency (RF) signaling. The PIV contactless interface is standardized
by ISO/IEC 14443. [ISO/IEC14443]
Controller (or Control Panel, or Panel): A device located within the secure area that
communicates with multiple PIV Card readers and door actuators, and with the Head End
System. The PIV Card readers provide cardholder information to the Controller, which it uses to
make access control decisions and release door locking mechanisms. The Controller
communicates with the Head End System to receive changes in access permissions, report
unauthorized access attempts and send audit records and other log information. Most modern
controllers can continue to operate properly during periods of time in which communication with
the Head End is disrupted and can journal transactions so that they can be reported to the Head
End when communication is restored.
Counterfeiting: In this publication, the creation of a fake ID card that can perform one or more
authentication mechanisms, without copying a legitimate card (see Cloning).
Credential: In this publication, a collection of information about a person, attested to by an
issuing authority. A credential may be a physical artifact (e.g., a PIV Card) or a data object
(e.g., a certificate). One or more data object credentials may be stored on the same physical
memory device (e.g., a smart card).
Credential Validation: The process of determining if a credential is valid, i.e., it was
legitimately issued, its activation date has been reached, it has not expired, it has not been
tampered with, and it has not been terminated, suspended, or revoked by the issuing authority.
Digital Signature: A data object produced by a digital signature method, such as Rivest, Shamir,
Aldeman (RSA) or the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), that when verified
provides strong evidence of the origin and integrity of the signed data object.
Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N): As required by FIPS 201, the primary
identifier on the PIV Card for physical access control. The FASC-N is a fixed length (25 byte)
data object, specified in [TIG SCEPACS], and included in several data objects on a PIV Card.
FASC-N Identifier: The FASC-N shall be in accordance with [TIG SCEPACS]. A subset of
FASC-N, a FASC-N Identifier, is a unique identifier as described in [TIG SCEPACS]. Section
2.1, 10th paragraph of [TIG SCEPACS] states “For full interoperability of a PACS it must at a
minimum be able to distinguish fourteen digits (i.e., a combination of an Agency Code, System
Code, and Credential Number) when matching FASC-N based credentials to enrolled card
holders.” Also, Section 6.6, 3rd paragraph of [TIG SCEPACS] states, “The combination of an
Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number is a fully qualified number that is uniquely


                                                                                              Page 8
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



assigned to a single individual”. The Agency Code is assigned to each Department or Agency by
Special Publication 800-87, Codes for the Identification of Federal and Federally-Assisted
Organizations [SP800-87]. The subordinate System Code and Credential Number value
assignment is subject to Department or Agency policy, provided that the FASC-N Identifier (i.e.
the concatenated Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number) is unique for each card.
Head End System (or Access Control Server): A system including application software,
database, a Head End server, and one or more networked personal computers. The Head End
server is typically used to enroll an individual's name, create a unique ID number, and assign
access privileges and an expiration date. The server is also used to maintain this information and
refresh the Controller(s) with the latest changes.
Identifier (or Unique Identifier): In this publication, a data object, assigned by an authority,
that unambiguously identifies a person within a defined community. For example, a Driver
License number identifies a licensed driver within a State. The authority registers people and
guarantees assignment of each identifier to a unique person.
Identity Credential: A credential that contains one or more identifiers for its subject, a person.
In this publication, an identity credential is designed to verify the identity of its subject through
authentication mechanisms, either manually (see VIS) or electronically (see CHUID, CAK,
PKI, BIO, and BIO-A).
Infrastructure: Distributed substructure of a large-scale organization that facilitates related
functions or operations, e.g., telecommunications infrastructure. With regard to PACS,
components include conduit, cabling, power supplies, battery backup, electrified door hardware,
door position switches, and remote exit devices, as well as connectivity with other life safety
systems that will ensure egress in the event of an emergency.
Interoperability: In this publication, the quality of allowing any government facility or
information system to verify a cardholder’s identity using the credentials on the PIV Card,
regardless of the PIV Card Issuer (PCI).
Issuance (or Credential Issuance): The process by which an issuing authority obtains and
verifies information about a person, assigns one or more unique identifiers to the person, prepares
information to be placed in or on a credential, produces a physical or data object credential, and
delivers the finished credential to its subject. In the case of PIV Cards, issuance is performed
only by accredited PCIs.
Multi-Factor Authentication: Authentication based on more than one factor. In some contexts,
each factor is a different authenticator. In other contexts, each factor is one of “something you
know, something you have, something you are” (i.e., memorized fact, token, or biometric) and
thus the number of factors is 1, 2, or 3.
PACS Registration: The process of authenticating, validating, and verifying information about
the PIV cardholder prior to entering the information into a PACS server. The information added
during registration is then utilized to perform authentication and authorization of an individual at
an access point.
Path Validation (or Trust Path Validation): The process of verifying the binding between the
subject identifier and subject public key in a certificate, based on the public key of a trust anchor,
through the validation of a chain of certificates that begins with a certificate issued by the trust
anchor and ends with the target certificate. Successful path validation provides strong evidence
that the information in the target certificate is trustworthy.
Personal Identification Number (PIN): Typically, a short numeric password (4 to 8 digits)
used as an authenticator with a bank card, ID card, or other personal security device.


                                                                                              Page 9
Special Publication 800-116                 A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card: The identity credential mandated by HSPD-12 and
defined by FIPS 201 as an end-point PIV Card. A PIV Card is a smart card with contact and
contactless communication capability, and eleven defined data objects for interoperability, five
mandatory and six optional.
PIV Implementation Maturity Model (PIMM): PIMM is a PIV implementation maturity
model that can be used to measure the progress of a facility or an agency towards accepting PIV
Card.
PIV System: A system comprised of components and processes that support a common (smart
card-based) platform for identity authentication across Federal departments and agencies for
access to multiple types of physical access environments.
Physical Access Control System (PACS): An electronic system that controls the ability of
people or vehicles to enter a protected area, by means of authentication and authorization at
access control points.
PKI: For this document, a PIV authentication mechanism that is implemented by an asymmetric
PIV authentication key challenge/response protocol.
Private Key: A cryptographic key used with a public key cryptographic algorithm, which is
uniquely associated with an entity, and not made public; it is used to generate a digital signature;
this key is mathematically linked with a corresponding public key.
Public Key: A cryptographic key used with a public key cryptographic algorithm, uniquely
associated with an entity, and which may be made public; it is used to verify a digital signature;
this key is mathematically linked with a corresponding private key.
Reader: A device that interfaces with a PIV Card and a Controller to execute or support
execution of one or more PIV authentication mechanisms.
Relying Party: In this publication, an entity, such as a PACS, that depends upon the trust model
of the PIV System to correctly produce the results of authentication, i.e., the identity of the
cardholder.
Revocation: The process by which an issuing authority renders an issued credential useless. For
example, a Certification Authority may revoke certificates it issues. Typically, a certificate is
revoked if its corresponding private key is known to be, or suspected to be, compromised, or if
the certificate’s subject affiliation is changed.
Secret Key: A key used by a symmetric key algorithm to encrypt, decrypt, sign, or verify
information. In a Symmetric Key Infrastructure (SKI), the sender and receiver of encrypted
information must share the same secret key.
Skimming: Surreptitiously obtaining data from a contactless smart card, using a hidden reader
that powers, commands, and reads from the card within the maximum read distance (reported as
about 25 cm with ISO/IEC 14443 smart cards like the PIV Card). [SKIMMER]
Sniffing: Surreptitiously obtaining data from a contactless smart card, using a hidden reader that
receives RF signals from a legitimate reader and smart card when they perform a transaction.
Sniffing is a form of electronic eavesdropping. Sniffing is possible at greater distances than
skimming.
Social Engineering: A process or technique, similar to a confidence game, used to obtain
information from a person without raising suspicion.
Termination: In this publication, the action of an identity credential issuer that causes the
credential to become invalid.


                                                                                             Page 10

a relying party has decided to trust, i.e., if a digital signature is verified using the public key
within the certificate, the signature is trusted to have been made by the entity named in the
certificate.
VIS: A FIPS 201 authentication mechanism in which the visual identity verification of a PIV
Card is done by a human guard.
Validation: In this publication, the process of determining that an identity credential was
legitimately issued and is still valid, i.e., has not expired or been terminated.
Verification: The process of determining if an assertion is true, particularly the process of
determining if a data object possesses a digital signature produced by the purported signer.
Wiegand: With regard to deployed PACS, a one-way communication protocol consisting of a

4.        Threat Environment

The PIV System is intended to enhance security and trust in identity credentials, but no practical
system can guarantee perfect security. This section discusses known technical threats to PIV
authentication mechanisms, especially the CHUID authentication mechanism. Methods of attack
are described in general terms, and this is not an exhaustive list of possible attacks. Attackers
often succeed by exploiting overlooked or newly introduced vulnerabilities in operational
systems.
The PIV System protects the trustworthiness of the PIV Card data objects through PIV Card
access rules and digital signatures. Overall trust in the execution of a PIV authentication
mechanism is also dependent on correct operation of the PIV Card, the PACS, and the PIV Card
validation infrastructure, and, to a degree, on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the communication channels among them. Attacks may, therefore, be directed
against any of these components, with varying difficulty and potential impact.
The factors critical to sustained trust in the PIV System are:

      +    The strength of cryptographic operations

      +    The protection of private and secret keys by system components

      +    The successful decryption and/or signature verification of data objects at expected times

      +    The continuous implementation of access rules by the PIV Card

      +    The dependable operation of other system elements in the PIV System and the PACS.
To execute a PIV authentication mechanism, the PIV cardholder presents his or her card to the
PACS. The presentation of the PIV Card occurs outside the security perimeter to which access is
requested. When the presentation occurs at the outermost perimeter of a facility, the cardholder is
in an Unrestricted area, and various technical attacks on PACS are easily carried out. Special
security precautions must be taken to ensure protection of these devices at the outermost
perimeters of the facility. Even at interior perimeters, the degree of protection provided by
enclosing perimeters may be modest when the means of attack can be easily concealed. Possible
attack vectors include identifier collisions, terminated PIV Cards, visual counterfeiting,
skimming, sniffing, social engineering, electronic cloning, and electronic counterfeiting. These
methods of attack, as well as others, are discussed below.

4.1       Identifier Collisions
By definition, a unique identifier for a PIV Card is a data artifact with a fixed value unique to one
particular PIV Card. PCIs create unique identifiers during the card issuance process. The
presence of a unique identifier allows a PIV Card to be uniquely identified by a relying system,
such as a PACS. If the unique identifier is ever truncated, compressed, hashed, or modified,
information could be lost. If information is lost from the unique identifier before it is compared
against Access Control List (ACL) entries, multiple cards may generate the same reduced
identifier. This is called an identifier collision. A collision means that multiple PIV Cards will
appear to belong to the same person, and will all be granted the same access privileges.




                                                                                             Page 12
Special Publication 800-116                A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



        The PIV Card mitigates the risk of collision by defining a unique FASC-N Identifier for
        the purposes of physical access control decisions. To prevent collisions, all access
        control decisions should be made by comparing the 14 decimal digit FASC-N Identifier,
        and optionally the values of additional FASC-N fields, against the ACL entries. See
        Appendix B for details and examples.

4.2   Terminated PIV Cards
PIV Cards may be terminated for a number of reasons, including a lost or stolen card. A
terminated PIV Card could continue to open doors with the CHUID authentication mechanism
long after the card has been terminated. As described in FIPS 201, the check for termination
should be performed by a status check, using either the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), on a PIV authentication certificate. Credential validation
is required by FIPS 201 for the PKI authentication mechanism, but it is not required, nor
described, for the CHUID authentication mechanism. If a PIV Card is reported as lost and then
terminated by the issuer, PACS relying on CHUID authentication mechanism will continue to
accept the CHUID until the user is de-authorized in each of those systems. If a PACS caches the
status of PIV Cards, the cached status of a terminated PIV Card will remain “valid” until the
cache is refreshed. The process for PACS de-authorization is not required or defined by FIPS
201, raising the possibility that on-line credential validation will not be implemented, or not
effectively implemented, where the CHUID authentication mechanism is employed.
        The PIV System mitigates the risk of use of a misappropriated PIV Card (which has been
        successfully reported and revoked) through the process of on-line credential validation.
        FIPS 201 Section 5.4.5 equates on-line PIV credential validation to path validation of a
        PIV authentication certificate. In the CHUID authentication mechanism, only the
        CHUID data object is read from the PIV Card, and a reader cannot check the status of a
        PIV authentication certificate on the basis of the CHUID alone. Therefore, it is
        recommended that path validation of a PIV authentication certificate be done at PIV
        registration, and periodically repeated by the PACS server as long as registration is
        maintained. Implementation methods are further discussed in Sections 7.4 and 7.5.

4.3   Visual Counterfeiting
PIV Cards are used in the VIS authentication mechanism that requires visual inspection of the
PIV Card by a security guard. A visual counterfeit mimics the appearance, but not the electronic
behavior, of an actual PIV Card. A PIV replica may be created by color photocopying or graphic
illustration methods and color printing to blank stock. Because of the required presence of one or
more security features on the PIV Card, a visual counterfeit is unlikely to pass close examination,
provided guards are trained to recognize security features. ID cards may receive only cursory
examination when used as “flash passes”, however.
        The PIV Card mitigates the risk of visual counterfeiting through its capability for rapid
        electronic authentication, and to a lesser degree, by the presence of one or more security
        features on the surface of the card. Given the ready availability of high-quality scanners,
        graphic editing software, card stock, and smart card printers, electronic verification is
        strongly recommended, either in place of the VIS authentication mechanism or in
        combination with it.




                                                                                           Page 13

4.4    Skimming
A contactless PIV Card reader with a sensitive antenna can be concealed in a briefcase, and is
capable of reading ISO/IEC 14443 contactless smart cards like the PIV Card at a distance of at
least 25 cm, as demonstrated in [SKIMMER]. The range of a skimmer is limited primarily by the
requirement for the skimmer to supply power to the PIV Card by inductive coupling. A
concealed skimmer could immediately obtain the free-read data from the PIV Card, which
includes the CHUID 4 and the certificates.
         The PIV Card mitigates the risk of skimming by access rules that prevent the release of
         biometric and other data over the contactless interface, and by minimizing content in the
         free-read data objects. Additional protection can be achieved by shielding techniques
         that positively deactivate a PIV Card when not in use. The electromagnetically opaque
         sleeve mentioned in FIPS 201 Section 2.4 is one such technique.

4.5    Sniffing
When a PIV Card is presented to a contactless reader at an access point, the reader supplies power
to the PIV Card through inductive coupling and a series of messages is exchanged between the
PIV Card and reader using RF communications. A sniffer is a receiver that does not supply
power to the smart card. A sniffer can operate at greater distance than a skimmer (sniffing at a
distance of about 10 m has been reported), because a legitimate reader powers the PIV Card at the
nominal distance of a few centimeters, while the sniffer’s RF receiver is farther away.
Potentially, a sniffer could capture the entire message transaction between the contactless reader
and the PIV Card.
         The PIV Card mitigates the risk of sniffing by the same access rules that prevent the
         release of biometric and other data over the contactless interface. The CHUID can be
         sniffed, however, when used over a contactless interface. Shielding techniques that
         positively deactivate a PIV Card when not in use cannot mitigate the risk of sniffing,
         because a PIV Card must be activated to perform a legitimate authentication transaction.

4.6    Social Engineering
If an attacker persuaded the cardholder to give them possession of the PIV Card, the attacker
could quickly insert the card into a contact reader and copy all of the information available as
free-read (the CHUID, the security object, the Card Capability Container, and the certificates)
over the contact interface. An attacker could also attempt a remote attack similar to well-known
phishing attacks by creating a web page that asks the subject to “insert their PIV Card and enter
their PIN” for an apparently legitimate purpose. If the cardholder complies, under some
assumptions the attacker could capture the cardholder’s PIN and all of the readable PIV data
objects, including the CHUID.
         The PIV Card mitigates the risk of social engineering attacks by blocking the release of
         all private and secret keys, and by requiring two-factor authentication (PIV Card and
         PIN) to perform cryptographic operations with the PIV Authentication Key. Moreover,
         the PIV Card is blocked upon exceeding the allocated number of bad PIN tries.
         Additional technical and procedural controls may be needed to counter PIV phishing.



4
 CHUID is one of the data elements of PIV credentials that uniquely identifies the PIV cardholder. CHUID stands for
Cardholder Unique Identifier. See the latest version of NIST SP 800-73 for a complete definition.



                                                                                                          Page 14
Special Publication 800-116                A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



4.7   Electronic Cloning
If an attacker has successfully conducted a skimming, sniffing, or social engineering attack, he or
she possesses verbatim copies of some of the data objects from an issued PIV Card. The objects
that are signed (e.g., the certificates and CHUID) retain their signatures, and the signatures are
valid if the original card is valid. The attacks described, however, cannot copy the private or
secret keys needed for cryptographic authentication methods. The attacker is thus able to create a
partial clone of the PIV Card that would succeed in CHUID-based authentication, but is not able
to create a clone that would succeed in PKI or CAK authentication mechanisms.
        The PIV Card mitigates the risk of electronic cloning by providing the PKI and CAK
        alternative mechanisms. It is strongly recommended that agencies use PKI or
        asymmetric CAK challenge/response methods instead of the CHUID authentication
        mechanism (see the Recommendation in Section 4.9).

4.8   Electronic Counterfeiting
An attacker could construct a battery-powered, microprocessor-based device that emulates a PIV
Card for purposes of the CHUID authentication mechanism. The attacker could program the
microprocessor to generate and test CHUIDs repetitively against a PACS reader, changing the
FASC-N credential identifier on each trial. This approach would not require prior capture of a
valid CHUID, but since the counterfeit CHUIDs would not possess valid issuer signatures, a
successful exploit depends on the absence of signature verification in the CHUID processing
done by the reader.
        The PIV Card mitigates the risk of electronic counterfeiting by storing a CHUID with a
        digital signature field. Electronic counterfeiting will be extremely difficult if CHUID
        signature verification is done, although signature verification is not required by FIPS
        201. Moreover, since many CHUIDs may be presented while an attacker probes for a
        valid CHUID, the PACS should employ methods to detect, alarm, and block repeated
        unsuccessful CHUID presentations.

4.9   Other Threats
The PIV System and PACS are complex, and this brief discussion has focused on properties of
the PIV Card. A number of other attack vectors have not been discussed in detail, including
sophisticated technical attacks against the integrity of the PIV Card, PIV System, or PACS
components, and cryptanalysis of the PIV cryptographic algorithms. While the impact of
successful attacks such as these could be moderate to high, the probability of success is believed
to be extremely low.
        Recommendation: This section emphasizes the technical risks that remain with
        the CHUID authentication mechanism. If the CHUID authentication mechanism
        were implemented without restriction, operational risk would increase as the value
        of targets and the availability of cloning and counterfeiting tools increase. NIST
        therefore recommends that the CHUID authentication mechanism be implemented
        in only two situations: 1) access control points separating two areas at the same
        impact level, either Controlled or Limited; and 2) combined with the VIS
        authentication mechanism at access points between Unrestricted and Controlled
        areas. See Section 7 for further detail. NIST further recommends that the
        asymmetric CAK authentication mechanism be used instead of the CHUID
        authentication mechanism to the greatest extent practical.

5.    Limitations of Deployed Physical Access Control Systems

FIPS 201 and its supporting special publications impose specific requirements on PACS
interfaces with PIV Card and PIV System. These requirements will present technical challenges
in migrating to PIV Card use in the areas of cardholder identification, card-to-reader interface,
and authentication protocol. The following sections explore how FIPS 201 requirements differ
from the capabilities of currently deployed PACS that are not PIV-enabled.

5.1   Cardholder Identification
PACS that are currently deployed in Federal government facilities use cards with data formats
that are often proprietary to the specific enterprise. Many of the installed PACS use an ID
number based on a 26-bit standard, which is comprised of an 8-bit site code and a 16-bit unique
card ID number with 2 bits assigned to parity (the parity bits add confidence that the data
transmission has no errors). The 8-bit site code accommodates 256 unique sites and the 16-bit
card ID number accommodates 65,536 unique users for that site. Larger ID numbers are used by
some systems but they are not necessarily interoperable.
A PACS based on the 26-bit format is deployed as a standalone solution at a dedicated site.
Typically, these solutions are managed locally, and an individual with an access card for one site
cannot use the same card at a second site and must obtain a second card. FIPS 201 changes this
dynamic because the credential is issued through a separate process instead of as part of the
PACS deployment. Deployed PACS need to be upgraded or re-provisioned to support at least a
14 decimal digit FASC-N Identifier.

5.2   Door Reader Interface
Deployed PACS readers come in varying configurations and offer multiple interface options for
the card and the Controller. FIPS 201 standardizes the use of the ISO/IEC 14443 interface for the
contactless reader to card communication. Note that the card reader may require additional
conformance testing for Federal acquisition. An authority for such conformance testing is the
[FIPS 201 Evaluation Program] which defines tests and maintains a list of approved products.
Not all existing PACS use this interface, so some agencies may have to plan to migrate from their
existing environment to the ISO/IEC 14443 conformant interface. Alternatively, an agency may
use the contact interface based on ISO/IEC 7816.
The interface from the Door Reader to the Controller also comes in different configurations.
FIPS 201 does not specify which protocols can be used for this interface, provided the necessary
data can be communicated to the Controller. Typical deployed implementations support
transmitting a small amount of data (on the order of 10 to 15 bytes), but FIPS 201 defines data
elements which are much larger. Therefore, depending on the agency’s implementation strategy,
an upgrade to the Door Reader to Controller interface may also be required. At a minimum, a 14
decimal digit FASC-N Identifier will be supported in most cases. Note that any change to this
interface may also necessitate changes to the physical wiring and cabling infrastructures.

5.3   Authentication Capability
Deployed PACS readers use proximity or magnetic stripe technology to interface with identity
cards and use proprietary protocols to communicate data. Some of these proprietary protocols
employ cryptography, but their use is limited to the local site. FIPS 201 specifies identity



                                                                                           Page 16
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



credentials that could be used for a new generation of identity management technology for
building access. FIPS 201 and its supporting special publications define the credential data
model and the card-to-reader interface, and also provide requirements for implementing the
digital certificates.
FIPS 201 added a standardized contactless and contact interface, biometric fingerprint, and
cryptography to the credential that could be used to attain a higher level of identity authentication
assurance. The capability to perform bi-directional data communication is fundamental to the
deployment of secure building access. Adding cryptography to the credentials permits agencies
to validate the data objects on the card and authenticate the cardholder. Adding credential
expiration and on-line credential validation requirements also strengthens access control
decisions. At the same time, FIPS 201 provided the opportunity to migrate building access
systems from LITTLE OR NO confidence assurance levels to VERY HIGH confidence assurance
levels. Existing PACS may need upgrades to take advantage of these features and functions, in
coordination with the following guidelines and authorities:

      +    FIPS 201 assurance levels

      +    Department of Justice Vulnerability Assessment Report of Federal Facilities

      +    OMB M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies. [M-04-04]
FIPS 201 redefines the requirements for building access in a fundamental way: instead of each
facility issuing an access card solely for that facility’s defined PACS architecture, a facility relies
on the PIV Card that was issued by the same, or a different, agency certified by the Federal
government. The facility still has control over the user’s access privileges, but the technology has
been standardized to optimize inter-agency interoperability and the credential has been issued to
the user as part of the FIPS 201 identity management process.

5.4       Deployed Wiring
Selecting a particular reader type and its interface with the Controller requires careful attention to
wiring. Existing wiring should be assessed for its ability to meet the requirements of new readers
and Controllers. The existing wiring may be a limiting factor due to its capacity to transmit data
and original specifications. Many recently installed systems use higher bandwidth cables, which
are typically sufficient for a PIV-based access control system. In some environments, advanced
signaling methods operating at higher speeds with lower signal-to-noise margins can necessitate
upgrades to the wiring.

5.5       Software Upgrades
Vendors may be able to upgrade their existing PACS software to minimize the hardware changes
needed for an existing PACS to accept PIV Cards. Software or firmware upgrades to Controllers
or Door readers may be available to agencies. PACS suppliers should be asked if software or
firmware upgrades supporting PIV Cards are a possibility. If available, the agency should ensure
that the software upgrade will have no adverse effect on the PACS system or any interconnected
systems.

5.6       Deployed Non-PIV PACS Cards and PIV Card Differences
The list below compares the basic differences in the technology offerings between the deployed
Non-PIV PACS cards and the PIV Card.



                                                                                              Page 17
Special Publication 800-116                 A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



    +   Some deployed PACS use site-specific card technology, with the result that a card cannot
        be used at sites with incompatible PACS. For example, a magnetic stripe card cannot be
        used at a proximity card site, and a magnetic stripe card from one vendor cannot be used
        at a site with magnetic stripe equipment from another vendor.

    +   Deployed PACS readers can read an identifying number from a card, but in most cases
        they do not perform a cryptographic challenge/response exchange. Many Non-PIV
        PACS cards can be copied easily.

    +   When two sites use compatible card technology, the risk of duplicate site identifiers for
        cards is always present. Without government-wide coordination of identifiers, the same
        identifier could be used on multiple cards at different sites.

    +   To achieve government-wide coordination of cardholder identifiers, enough identifiers
        must be available for all government-issued credentials. Many deployed PACS have a
        limit on the number of sites (256) and the number of users per site (65,536) that is too
        small for government-wide use and can lead to the same identifiers being issued to
        different individuals.

    +   Deployed PACS control expiration of credentials through an expiration date stored in a
        site database, whereas with PIV Cards expiration dates can be obtained from the cards
        themselves. There is no simple way to synchronize the expiration of credentials for a
        Federal employee or contractor with access to multiple sites unless all sites are tied into a
        centralized database for the deployed PACS.

    +   Use of PINs, public key infrastructure, and biometrics with deployed PACS is managed
        on a site-specific basis at the PACS server. Individuals must enroll PINs, keys, or
        biometrics at each site. Since PINs, keys, and biometrics are often stored in a site
        database, they may not be technically interoperable with the requirements of other sites.
FIPS 201-conformant PACS eliminate or substantially reduce each of these limitations, relative to
deployed PACS installations.




                                                                                             Page 18

6.        The PIV Vision

HSPD-12 begins, “Wide variations in the quality and security of forms of identification used to
gain access to secure Federal and other facilities where there is potential for terrorist attacks need
to be eliminated.” HSPD-12 continues, in Paragraph 2, “As promptly as possible… the heads of
executive departments and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, require the use of
identification by Federal employees and contractors that meets the Standard in gaining physical
access to Federally controlled facilities…”
HSPD-12 directs Federal departments and agencies to improve identification and authentication
of Federal employees and contractors requiring access to Federally controlled facilities through
the widespread application of FIPS 201. The standard defines the characteristics of the PIV
System. This section describes the benefits that are expected from the use of the PIV System, to
the maximum extent practicable, for authenticating people to PACS managed by the United
States Government.
This section focuses on the benefits of electronic verification and direct integration with an
electronic PACS. The VIS authentication mechanism, which must be verified manually, is
applicable to physical access control, as described in other sections of this publication. The FIPS
201 authentication mechanisms that can be performed electronically are CHUID, PKI, BIO, and
BIO-A. NIST SP 800-73, included by reference in FIPS 201, defines an additional, optional
authentication mechanism, CAK. [SP800-73]

6.1       Interoperability
In this publication, the term interoperability means the ability to use any PIV Card with any
PACS application performing one or more PIV authentication mechanisms. The data objects and
keys placed on a PIV Card during issuance use specific cryptographic algorithms selected from
the acceptable algorithms in [SP800-78]. A PACS application can interrogate the card to learn
which algorithms are used. To attain full interoperability, a relying PACS application will need
to support all acceptable algorithms, key lengths, and key material that could be presented, either
by a PIV Card or by the PIV infrastructure.
The interoperability goal of the PIV-enabled PACS can be stated:
      1. Any PIV Card can provide proof of identity to any electronic PACS (access is granted
         only if the identity is so authorized).
      2. After a successful authentication, the authentication mechanism provides the cardholder’s
         authenticated identity, in the form of a FASC-N Identifier (a subset of FASC-N as
         defined in Section 3), to the relying party.
To achieve interoperability, the PACS should at least observe the following conditions:

      +    If the PKI authentication mechanism is performed by a PACS application, the PACS
           should support all of the asymmetric algorithms permitted for the PIV Authentication
           Key, as specified in Table 3-1 of [SP800-78], i.e., RSA 1024 (through 31 December
           2013), RSA 2048, and ECDSA P-256, and the PACS should accept all valid PIV
           authentication certificates and require PIN entry.




                                                                                              Page 19
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



      +    If the CAK authentication mechanism is performed by the PACS, the accepted
           algorithms will be the same, but the PACS will accept only Card Authentication Key
           certificates and not require PIN entry.

      +    If CHUID authentication with signature verification is performed, the PACS should
           support all of the signature algorithms and key sizes permitted by Table 3-3 of [SP800-
           78]. If only CHUID authentication without signature verification of the CHUID is
           performed, no cryptographic operations are performed, and no cryptographic requirement
           is placed on the PACS.

      +    PINs required for PIV authentication mechanisms are strings of eight or fewer decimal
           digits. For PKI, BIO, and BIO-A authentication mechanisms, a PIN entry device must
           acquire PINs from the cardholder and present them to the PIV Card to activate the card.
The PIMM presented in Section 9 can be used to measure progress towards the interoperability
goal. When PIV implementation is complete, all installed PACS readers will be approved
products on the GSA HSPD-12 Evaluation Program Approved Products List, and each will be
capable of one or more PIV authentication mechanisms. [FIPS 201 Evaluation Program] At this
time, any PIV Card will be able to perform any authentication mechanism it has been issued to
perform at any PACS.
The ability of a PIV Card and cardholder to authenticate at a reader does not mean they will be
granted access—it means only that the cardholder has been identified, with the assurance level of
the authentication mechanism employed, to the reader. A cardholder must authenticate and be
authorized to be granted access. Authorization policies and mechanisms are outside the scope of
FIPS 201.
           Recommendation: To obtain the full benefit of PIV interoperability, HSPD-12
           project managers should ensure that relying systems have the capability to use all
           cryptographic algorithms that apply to the authentication mechanism(s) performed.
           Departments and agencies should procure and deploy HSPD-12 products on the
           GSA HSPD-12 Evaluation Program Approved Products List where applicable, and
           can use the PIMM presented in Section 9 to measure progress toward the goal of
           interoperability. [FIPS 201 Evaluation Program]

6.2       Qualities of the Complete Implementation
The PIV System implementation will be complete when the following qualities have been
achieved.
      1. PIV authentication mechanisms are used wherever they are applicable, in accordance
         with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201.
      2. Electronic authentication (as opposed to VIS authentication) is the common practice.
      3. Electronic validation of the PIV Card is done at or near the time of authentication.
      4. All PIV Card access control decisions are made by comparing an initial string of the
         FASC-N Identifier against the ACL entries. See Appendix B for details and examples.
      5. PIV authentication mechanisms are applied based on the impact assessed for the area.
      6. Cryptographic and biometric authentications are applied widely in moderate- and high-
         impact [FIPS199] areas.


                                                                                            Page 20
Special Publication 800-116                   A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



      7. Agencies exhibit reciprocal trust in the process assurance of PCIs.
      8. Both new and upgraded PACS applications accept PIV Cards as proof of identity for user
         registration/provisioning, user authentication, or both.
HSPD-12 declares its goals are to “…enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce
identity fraud, and protect personal privacy,” and states specific criteria to be met by the
implementation:
      “Secure and reliable forms of identification" for purposes of this directive means
      identification that (a) is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employee's
      identity; (b) is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
      exploitation; (c) can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and (d) is issued only by
      providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process. The
      Standard will include graduated criteria, from least secure to most secure, to ensure flexibility
      in selecting the appropriate level of security for each application.”
The Federal Information Security Management Act [FISMA] mandated the standardization of
security management practices for information systems. The foundational concept of FISMA
security management is impact assessment and impact-based planning (“impact” being a
generalization of “exposure” to monetary and non-monetary damage). FIPS 201 follows this
methodology by implementing authentication mechanisms at three E-Authentication confidence
levels (SOME, HIGH, and VERY HIGH). A gap remains, however, between the concepts of
impact and confidence levels. This document suggests a method to close this gap through the use
of risk-based planning and the establishment of “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” boundaries for
appropriately protecting facility assets or resources.
Interoperability of PIV Cards and PIV authentication mechanisms is not a guaranteed
consequence of the technical standard. Government-wide interoperability also requires Federal
agencies to exhibit reciprocal trust in the processes of PCIs and the service quality of the PIV
Card validation and revocation infrastructure. Reciprocal trust is enabled by the requirements for
the PIV issuance process stated in FIPS 201, and supported by the Accreditation process
methodology described in NIST SP 800-79. [SP800-79] Trust is built when the technical
standard is thorough, unambiguous, and grounded in practical requirements; when the
conformance and audit processes are documented and uniformly practiced; and when positive
PIV System audit results are available to the community of relying parties.
          Recommendation: Once all appropriate authentication mechanisms are satisfied,
          access control decisions are made by comparing the 14 decimal digit FASC-N
          Identifier, and optionally the values of additional FASC-N fields, against the ACL
          entries.
          Recommendation: As agencies develop risk-based implementation plans, they
          will create and evolve plans for PIV Card issuance and application integration.
          They might consider which of the eight qualities are most relevant to agency goals
          and priorities, and derive further project objectives, metrics, and milestones from
          those qualities. They should also consider the relation of HSPD-12 to FISMA
          requirements, and examine the potential for cost tradeoffs where PIV can replace
          more expensive authentication methods.

6.3     Benefits of the Complete Implementation
The complete PIV System will be an identity infrastructure that is attractive to Federal agencies,
application owners, and contractors because of these benefits:


                                                                                              Page 21
Special Publication 800-116                        A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



    +    Enhanced trust. PIV Cards will be issued in accordance with a standardized, audited
         process, which will exceed the best practice level for low- and moderate-impact
         applications today, and equal best practice reached for high-impact applications.

    +    Resistance to misuse and cloning. Electronic validation of the PIV Card, using digital
         signatures, makes it tamper-resistant. Cryptographic challenge/response protocols make
         the PIV Card counterfeit-resistant. Biometric authentication makes the PIV Card non-
         transferable.

    +    Status and revocation. PIV Card Issuer process assurance will extend beyond the
         issuance action to PIV Card validation and revocation services. These services are
         required elements of the PIV infrastructure, and will be implemented, monitored, and
         audited with the same care as the PIV issuance process.

    +    Standard identity infrastructure. Application developers will assume, as a default, that
         registration and authentication will use a PIV Card identity, reducing development cost,
         registration time, and the application learning curve for new subjects.

    +    Integrated system. PACS will be fully integrated with other PIV system components that
         perform provisioning, enrollment, and finalization.

    +    Fewer passwords. A single PIV Card provides a small set of authentication methods that
         are applicable to many applications and in many contexts. This means significantly
         fewer passwords and account enrollments.
Each of these points both enhances security and creates efficiency of operation. Reducing
passwords and password helpdesk calls, reusing identity enrollment across multiple applications,
collapsing redundant status and revocation processes (separate processes for revocation on
termination across multiple applications), and replacing authentication credentials that are easily
shared or transferred will reduce operating costs borne by Federal agencies. Availability of a
skilled workforce familiar with the standardized PIV identity infrastructure, implementation of
PIV issuance with a standardized identity verification methodology, the existence of high-
availability on-line services for PIV Card status and validation, and pre-enrollment in a
graduated, multi-factor authentication scheme all enhance security current practice in many
applications. The replacement of password (single-factor) authentication with PIV Card (one,
two, or three-factor) authentication is a fundamental advance in authentication assurance.
Biometric enrollment is mandatory for the PIV Card. Every government employee and contractor
who can provide at least one fingerprint image of acceptable quality will be pre-enrolled for
biometric authentication. 5 In the complete PIV System, the marginal cost for biometric
enrollment to the application owner, relative to other authentication mechanisms, is near zero,
enabling more applications to gain the benefits of biometric authentication.
         Recommendation: Operational metrics should be designed to measure actual
         benefits over the operational lifetime of the PIV System. They may be derived by
         formulating each of the expected benefits above as a service quality metric, e.g.,
         for “integrated system”, service quality could be defined as the percentage of


5
  [FIPS201] Section 4.4.1 states that “In cases where there is difficulty in collecting even a single fingerprint of
acceptable quality, the department or agency shall perform authentication using asymmetric cryptography as described
in Section 6.2.4.” Also, see [SP800-76] Section 3.3 and 3.4.

         PACS registrations that are performed automatically by provisioning from the PIV
         issuance system.

6.4     Infrastructure Requirements
The qualities and benefits of the complete PIV System can only be achieved if its implementation
is supported by general advances in infrastructure used by PACS. The following areas have
significant influence on the rate at which the complete PIV System integration can be achieved by
PACS, and should therefore be supported by PACS upgrades and new PACS procurements:
      1. Fast, two-way communication between readers and controllers or panels
      2. Fast network communication between readers, controllers, or panels and PIV status and
         validation services
Point (1) allows readers to access cached validation status during access control transactions.
Point (2) allows controllers or panels to cache the validation status. Points (1) and (2) combined
could allow readers direct access to PIV status and validation services, if needed.
         Recommendation: Maximum benefit will be obtained from the PIV System when
         it is adequately supported by infrastructure. Infrastructure upgrades may be
         justified, especially to improve communication among PACS system elements
         (e.g., support two-way communication).

7.    PIV Authentication Mechanisms

This section provides a discussion of PIV authentication mechanisms and their application in
PACS environments. PIV authentication mechanisms offer a range of security measures (of
different throughputs) that can be applied in a PACS environment. This section first describes a
measurement scale for security relevant to PACS environments. Then it discusses security
offerings of each PIV authentication mechanism and their combinatory effects on identity
authentication. Finally, this section provides recommendations on the use of PIV authentication
mechanisms in a PACS environment.

7.1   Authentication Factors
One of the functions of the PACS application is to verify the identity of the cardholder presenting
a PIV Card. The PACS application may perform one or more authentication mechanisms using
the PIV Card to establish confidence in the identity of the cardholder. The authentication of an
identity is based on the verification of one, two, or three of these factors: a) “something you
have”, for example, possession of the PIV Card; b) “something you know”, for example,
knowledge of the PIN; and c) “something you are”, for example, presentation of live fingerprints
by a cardholder.
The PIV Card authentication mechanisms operate in several different ways, as defined in
[FIPS201], [SP800-73], and [SP800-76]. For example, a data object may be read from the PIV
Card and its signature verified (CHUID authentication mechanism). A private key on the PIV
Card may be used to sign a challenge (PKI and CAK authentication mechanisms). A valid
biometric may be read from the card and compared against a live fingerprint scan (BIO and BIO-
A authentication mechanisms).
Also, PIV Card authentication mechanisms may be performed by different entities, referred to
here as verifiers. For example, a PACS application verifies the signature on a data object, or the
signing of a challenge using a private key or comparison of biometric templates. The verifier can
also be the PIV Card itself. For example, the PIN is verified by the PIV Card. The PIN
verification by the PIV Card should be trusted by the PACS only if the card is trusted to be a
valid PIV Card. For example, when PKI + BIO(-A) authentication mechanisms are combined, or
CAK + BIO(-A) authentication mechanisms are combined, all three factors are achieved. The
PIN verification by the card can be trusted by the PACS because the PIV Card has authenticated
to the PACS using the PKI or CAK authentication mechanisms, respectively.
The confidence in the cardholder’s identity increases with the number of factors used to
authenticate the PIV Card. Table 7-1 provides a list of PIV authentication mechanisms and their
authentication factors. Note that CAK + BIO(-A) authentication mechanism is recognized as a
unique combination in this table. This is due to the fact that neither CAK nor BIO(-A)
individually provide “something you know” authentication factor, but when they are used
together, PIN verification provides this factor. Many different combinations of the Table 7-1
authentication mechanisms are possible and an exhaustive list of combinations is provided in
Appendix C.




                                                                                           Page 24

Each of the above PIV authentication mechanisms is described further in the following sections.

7.1.1    Deployed Proximity or Magnetic Stripe Authentication
Deployed proximity and magnetic stripe authentication are not PIV authentication mechanisms
and when used in conjunction with PIV authentication mechanisms, there is a strong potential for
“collisions”. Proximity and magnetic stripe card technology read a number from a card and send
it to the Controller. The Controller compares this number against its database to make the access
control decision. If a deployed system does not include an agency code in the numbers
compared, an out-of-agency cardholder may be mistakenly accepted as an authorized site user.
Refer to Appendix B for additional details. Moreover, proximity and magnetic stripe cards can
be easily counterfeited or cloned.

7.1.2    Visual (VIS) Authentication
Visual authentication entails inspection of the topographical features on the front and back of the
PIV Card. The human guard checks to see that the PIV Card looks genuine, compares the
cardholder’s facial features with the picture on the card, checks the expiration date printed on the
card, verifies the correctness of other data elements printed on the card, and visually verifies the
security feature(s) on the card. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on training, skill,
and diligence of the guard (to match the face in spite of changes in beard, mustache, hair coloring,
eye glasses, etc.)—counterfeit IDs and banknotes can pass visual inspections easily. Digital
scanners, printers, and image editing software have made counterfeiting easier. Moreover, the
visual verification of security features does not scale well across agencies since each agency may
implement different security features.

7.1.3    Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID) Authentication
The CHUID, as defined in FIPS 201, is one of the data objects on PIV credentials. The CHUID
includes a FASC-N data element that uniquely identifies the PIV Card. The CHUID also
uniquely identifies an individual since each PIV Card is issued to an individual. The CHUID data
object is signed by the issuer so alterations or modifications to a CHUID can be detected.




                                                                                            Page 25
Special Publication 800-116                        A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



The CHUID is standardized by FIPS 201; therefore, a CHUID data object can be counterfeited
easily with the exception of the issuer signature. A counterfeit CHUID would not possess a valid
issuer signature. The CHUID is a free read object on the PIV Card; therefore, it can be read or
cloned easily. Because of the risk of CHUID counterfeiting or cloning, the CHUID
authentication mechanism, used in isolation, provides a confidence level that is comparable to
proximity cards in widespread use today. However, if the CHUID signature verification is
performed, the PACS can be sure the CHUID came from a valid issuer and it has not been
altered. Reading the CHUID from a PIV Card is not sufficient to establish confidence in
cardholder’s identity. Therefore, in order to achieve single-factor authentication with CHUID,
the relying parties must validate the signature on the CHUID.

7.1.4    Card Authentication Key (CAK) Authentication
The CAK is an optional key that may be present on any PIV Card. As the name implies, the
purpose of the CAK authentication mechanism is to authenticate the card and therefore its
possessor. The CAK is unique among the PIV keys in several respects:
         1. The CAK may be used on the contactless or contact interface in a challenge/response
            protocol;
         2. The use of the CAK does not require PIN entry; and
         3. NIST strongly recommends that every PIV Card contain an asymmetric CAK and
            corresponding certificate, and that PACS use an asymmetric challenge/response CAK
            protocol. However, [FIPS201] permits the CAK on a specific card to be either
            asymmetric or symmetric.
Points (1) and (2) were intended to allow the CAK to be used for one-factor authentication to
PACS readers. The result will still remain a one-factor authentication. CAK authentication
mechanism examples are given in [SP800-73], Appendix B.
Point (3), specifically the asymmetric CAK, ensures that government-wide interoperability
among PACS applications is preserved. Due to the optionality and algorithm variability of the
CAK permitted by [FIPS201], agency specific symmetric CAK authentication will not scale to an
interoperable authentication mechanism across agencies. For this reason, NIST recommends that
asymmetric CAK be encouraged as the interoperable, single-factor PIV authentication
mechanism for PACS.
         Recommendation: NIST strongly recommends that every PIV Card contain an
         asymmetric CAK and corresponding certificate, and that PACS use an asymmetric
         challenge/response CAK protocol.

7.1.5    PIV Authentication Key (PKI) Authentication
PACS may be designed to perform public key cryptography-based authentication using the PIV
Authentication Key. Use of the PKI provides two-factor 6 authentication, since the cardholder
must enter a PIN to unlock the card in order to successfully authenticate.
When using the PKI authentication mechanism, FIPS 201 requires the PACS to determine the
validity of certificates at the time an individual presents his or her card to a card reader. This may

6
  Two-factor authentication is a system wherein two different methods are used to authenticate. An example of two-
factor authentication is a verification of “something you have” and “something you know". Using two factors as
opposed to one delivers a higher level of authentication assurance.



                                                                                                           Page 26
Special Publication 800-116                          A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



be done on-line in real-time, or it may be implemented by pre-validating the certificates and
caching the results. Section 7.4 specifies procedures for performing public key cryptography-
based authentication under the assumption that only individuals who are pre-enrolled will be
granted access. 7 Section 7.5 further describes the caching status proxy.

7.1.6     BIO Authentication
PACS may be designed to perform biometric authentication using the fingerprint information
stored on the PIV Card. 8 The biometric on the PIV Card is signed by the issuer, so the
authenticity of the biometric can be checked by the PACS. Verification of the signature on the
biometric data object, and matching of the reference biometric template with the sample
biometric template, is performed by the PACS application. The verification of signature and
matching of biometric results in one-factor authentication. This authentication mechanism does
not include authentication of the PIV Card. Potentially, a biometric template could be placed on a
fake card, so neither the “something you have” nor “something you know” factors are validated.
As a result, this document rates the BIO authentication mechanism as a one-factor (“something
you are”) authentication mechanism. BIO combined with cryptographic challenge/response, PKI
+ BIO or CAK + BIO, authenticates the PIV Card and thus achieves three-factor authentication.
          Recommendation: A PACS should always verify the digital signature on the biometric
          template data object, and do path validation, before performing a match. Otherwise, the
          result of the match should not be trusted.
          Recommendation: Biometric readers, especially those used at access points to Limited
          and Exclusion areas, should have a proven capability to accept live fingers and reject
          artificial fingers. Biometric readers, especially unattended readers in an Unrestricted
          area, should be physically hardened to protect against direct electrical compromise.

7.1.7     BIO-A Authentication
This authentication mechanism is the same as BIO authentication but an attendant supervises the
use of the PIV Card and the submission of the PIN and the sample biometric by the cardholder.
Some fingerprint biometric readers have been shown to accept fake or synthetic fingerprints;
others may allow access to internal wiring with relative ease. The presence of an attendant during
BIO-A authentication serves to mitigate these risks. Moreover, the presence of an attendant also
provides increased assurance, relative to BIO, that a fake card is not being used, which accounts
for an additional authentication factor of “something you have.” Since the PIN is verified by the
PIV Card and the card itself is not verified by PACS, the “something you know” authentication
factor is not validated. In summary, the BIO-A authentication mechanism benefits from a
presence of visual, but not from a strong challenge/response authentication, with the PIV Card.
Therefore, BIO-A is considered a two-factor authentication mechanism.




7
 Pre-enrolling a certificate is not the same as pre-authorizing the identity for access. Pre-enrolling means only that a
valid identity is known to the PACS. Authorization decisions for known identities are made separately.
8
  There will be instances where a PIV Card does not store two fingerprint templates with an acceptable quality score.
In these cases, follow the recommendations stated in FIPS 201 Section 4.4.1, "In cases where there is difficulty in
collecting even a single fingerprint of acceptable quality, the department or agency shall perform authentication using
asymmetric cryptography as described in Section 6.2.4." and [SP800-76] Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Alternatively, agency
security policy may require additional authentication mechanisms in consideration of impact-based security
management.



                                                                                                                Page 27
Special Publication 800-116                        A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



7.1.8    CAK + BIO(-A) Authentication
As discussed in Section 7.1.6 and 7.1.7, BIO(-A) by itself does not provide three-factor
authentication. However, when BIO(-A) and CAK authentication mechanisms are performed at
the same time, the verification of the PIN can be trusted because the PIV Card is authenticated by
CAK. CAK + BIO(-A) is listed in Table 7-1 because the combined authentication mechanism is
judged to achieve three-factor authentication (which would not be predicted by the sum of the
HKA vectors of CAK + BIO(-A)). 9

7.2     Multi-Factor Authentication
Possession of a valid PIV Card as evidenced by visual inspection of the card, reading a signed
object from the card, or performing challenge/response authentication with the card, provides
one-factor authentication. For this reason, the VIS, CHUID, and CAK authentication
mechanisms provide one-factor authentication. VIS provides weak one-factor authentication
since the card verification is subjective. CHUID also provides weak one-factor authentication
since it could be cloned or counterfeited (in absence of signature verification). The BIO
mechanism provides one-factor authentication since the reference biometric template is compared
against the sample biometric template. The PKI authentication mechanism provides two-factor
authentication since it requires possession of the PIV Card and knowledge of the PIN. The BIO-
A mechanism provides two-factor authentication since the reference biometric template is
compared with the sample biometric template in the presence of an attendant. The BIO-A
mechanism requires a PIV Card, knowledge of a PIN, and live fingerprint. The knowledge of a
PIN, the third factor of authentication, can only be trusted by combining PKI + BIO(-A) or CAK
+ BIO(-A) authentication mechanisms. The next section describes the use of multi-factor
authentication in the PACS environment.

7.3     Selection of PIV Authentication Mechanisms
A risk-based approach should be used when selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms
for physical access to Federal government buildings and facilities. Determining risk to the
facility is beyond the scope of this document; however, an agency may use a Facility Security
Level (FSL) Determination to derive the FSL for its facilities. There is no simple one-to-one
mapping between the FSL and the authentication mechanism(s) that should be employed. An
FSL I campus facility may have a need for nested perimeters due to localized high-value assets.
An FSL III facility may not have any high-value assets but may be larger in population. An FSL
V facility may need the highest level of authentication assurance at all access points except the
public entrance to a visitor center.
For these reasons, it is recommended that authentication mechanisms be selected on the basis of
protective areas established around assets or resources. This document adopts the concept of
“Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas as defined in [PHYSEC]. Procedurally, proof of
affiliation is often sufficient to gain access to a Controlled area (e.g., an agency’s badge to that
agency’s headquarters’ outer perimeter). Access to Limited areas is often based on functional
subgroups or roles (e.g., a division badge to that division’s building or wing). The individual
membership in the group or privilege of the role is established by authentication of the identity of
the cardholder. Access to Exclusion areas may be gained by individual authorization only.
Federal government facilities can be identified and categorized in these areas and correspond

9
 PKI + BIO(-A) also achieves three-factor authentication, but is not present in Table 7-1 because three factors are
predicted by the sum of the HKA vectors of PKI and BIO(-A). For all combined mechanisms not in the table, the sum
of the HKA vectors correctly predicts the number of factors achieved.



                                                                                                          Page 28

generally to LOW (for Controlled), MODERATE (for Limited), and HIGH (for Exclusion)
impact assets or resources [FIPS 199]. This document recommends that Table 7-2 be used to
determine the minimum number of authentication factors needed to satisfy security requirements
of the area.

Figure 7-1 illustrates the innermost perimeter at which each PIV authentication mechanism may
be used based on the authentication assurance level of the mechanism. Table 7-2 and Figure 7-1
both express constraints on the authentication mechanism that may be selected. The combined
effect of Table 7-2 and Figure 7-1 determines exactly what mechanisms may be used. An
exhaustive list of possible uses of PIV authentication mechanisms against protected areas is
provided in Appendix C.

Note 1. “CHUID + VIS” means a combined authentication mechanism performing visual
        inspection of the PIV Card and CHUID authentication at the same access point. “CAK +
        BIO(-A)” means a combined authentication mechanism performing CAK and BIO or
        CAK and BIO-A at the same access point, both using the contact interface of the PIV
        Card. The term “combine” means that more than one independent authentication


                                                                                            Page 29

        mechanisms must successfully authenticate the presenting person, at the same access
        point, before access is permitted.
Note 2. Authentication mechanisms shown at a perimeter in Figure 7-1 may also be used alone at
        a perimeter farther out, subject to the requirements in Table 7-2, but not the reverse. If
        authentication mechanisms are combined in ways not shown in Figure 7-1, at least one of
        the combined mechanisms must be allowed by Figure 7-1 at the perimeter of use. For
        example, “BIO and CHUID” could be used at access points A or B, but not at access
        point C.
Note 3. In a particular facility, a single perimeter may separate areas with a difference of more
        than one impact level. A single perimeter may allow access from Unrestricted to
        Limited, Unrestricted to Exclusion, or Controlled to Exclusion areas, and in these cases,
        the PIV authentication mechanisms should be combined to achieve necessary
        authentication factors to enter the innermost area.
Note 4. Within a Controlled or Limited area, an access point to an adjacent area at the same
        impact level may employ any of the authentication mechanisms shown in Figure 7-1, as
        well as the CHUID authentication mechanism without VIS.
Note 5. Within an Exclusion area, an access point to an adjacent area at the same impact level
        should use two or three-factor authentication.
Note 6. In most cases, Figure 7-1 and these notes allow flexibility in the selection of specific
        authentication mechanisms. A decision should be made based on the local security
        policy and operational considerations.
Note (1) ensures that the CHUID mechanism is combined with VIS where impact level escalation
occurs, mitigating the risks described in Section 4.
Notes (3) and (5) ensure that two-factor authentication is always employed to enter Limited areas,
and three-factor authentication is employed to enter Exclusion areas. It also ensures that
credential validation is done in either case.
Notes (4) and (5) add some flexibility in the case of discretionary access control among areas at
the same impact level.
The authentication mechanisms in Figure 7-1 apply at all Threat Condition levels. At Threat
Conditions Green, Blue, and Yellow, the facility should use the authentication mechanisms at
each perimeter as shown. At Threat Condition Orange, the facility should use two or three-factor
authentication at the Controlled perimeters.
When the Threat Condition level increases, some access points may be closed. Access points that
remain open should be capable of the required authentication mechanisms at the elevated Threat
Condition level.
PIV authentication mechanisms can be mapped to perimeter crossings in many ways, provided
that the requirements of this section are met. Figure 7-2 below provides some examples of
mapping PIV authentication mechanisms to the perimeter crossings within a facility.

             Figure 7-2: Examples of Mapping PIV Authentication Mechanisms
The figure illustrates five different examples. Other sequences of authentication mechanisms are
possible. Refer to Appendix C for a complete list of possible combinations of PIV authentication
mechanisms that could be used in Federal agency facility environments. Each example below is
labeled with a number and is described as follows:
    1. CAK, CHUID + VIS, or BIO authentication mechanisms provide one-factor
       authentication and can be used to cross from Uncontrolled to Controlled areas.
    2. BIO-A or PKI authentication mechanisms provide two-factor authentication and can be
       used to cross into Limited areas. The example shows the BIO-A or PKI authentication
       mechanism used to cross from Controlled to Limited areas.
    3. Authentication in context can be leveraged if the “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas
       are nested. This example shows that if the BIO or BIO-A authentication mechanism is
       used to access the Limited area, then the PKI authentication mechanism may be used to
       control access to the Exclusion area without requiring the cardholder to repeat the BIO or
       BIO-A authentication mechanism. Conversely, if the PKI authentication mechanism was
       used to access the Limited area, then BIO-A authentication may be used to control access
       to the Exclusion area. Authentication in context can be leveraged only when the PACS
       can store and recall recent access control decision. This in turn would require a
       cardholder to authenticate at the outer perimeter prior to the inner perimeter. The risk of
       piggybacking, in which a person follows a cardholder through a door without
       authenticating, may thus be mitigated by authentication in context.
    4. This example shows that an authentication at one level may be used at lower levels. This
       example shows the CAK + BIO (-A) authentication mechanism may be used to cross
       from Uncontrolled to Controlled, Uncontrolled to Limited, or Uncontrolled to Exclusion.




                                                                                                       Page 31

      5. This example shows that authentication in context is not always possible and a single
         perimeter may separate areas with a difference of more than one impact level. 10 The
         example shows that PKI + BIO (-A) authentication mechanism may be used to cross from
         Uncontrolled to Exclusion, Controlled to Exclusion, or Limited to Exclusion. Note that
         the three-factor authentication rule is observed in all possible crossings.
Figure 7-2 shows some legitimate examples of mapping PIV authentication mechanisms to the
perimeter crossings. There are also authentication mechanisms that do not meet the requirements
of Table 7-2. For example, the CAK authentication mechanism should not be used to access
Limited or Exclusion areas. Limited and Exclusion require two or three-factor authentication,
while CAK only provides one-factor authentication. Also, sometimes combining authentication
mechanisms does not add up to the required authentication factors. For example, CAK + PKI is
not a valid authentication mechanism to access Exclusion areas. Note that CAK + PKI only
provides two factors (“something you have” and “something you know”) of authentication.
         Recommendation: Authentication assurance will be increased if a PACS uses relevant
         information from previous access control decisions (“context”) when making a new
         access control decision. For example, if a cardholder attempts to pass from a Controlled
         to a Limited area, the PACS could require that the cardholder was recently allowed
         access to the Controlled area. Historically, rigorous implementation of this concept
         required person-traps and exit tracking, but partial implementations have significant
         value, and could be strengthened by new technology and systems integration.

7.4     PACS Registration
Before a PACS may grant access to a cardholder, the cardholder must be authorized for access in
the PACS. Authorization may be granted to a group of individuals, such as all PIV cardholders,
or all PIV cardholders sponsored by a specific agency or bureau (see Appendix B). If
authorization is granted to specific individuals, information about the cardholder (specifically, at
least the FASC-N) must be added to the PACS Server’s authorization database.
If on-line credential validation is performed by the PACS at the time of each authentication (see
Section 7.5), the PACS might store no information about the cardholder other than the
authorizations and transaction audit log.
If a caching status proxy is employed, information about the cardholder, including the
cardholder’s certificate, must be added to the server’s database. Where one-factor authentication
is sufficient, the CAK or PKI certificate may be used. Where at least two-factor authentication is
required, the PIV Authentication Key certificate should be used. Enrollment using a caching
status proxy should collect and store information required for all FIPS 201 authentication
mechanisms needed in the event of increased Threat Condition level.
         Recommendation: When a card is terminated, the PIV Card Issuer must revoke all valid
         authentication certificates for the PIV Card. The authentication certificates include the
         PIV Authentication Key certificate and the Card Authentication Key certificate (if
         present).
When the individual is enrolled using a caching status proxy, the enrollment station obtains the
PIV Authentication or asymmetric Card Authentication Key certificate from the PIV Card,
validates the certificate (including checking the certificate’s revocation status), and sends a


10
  Although a single perimeter could separate areas with a difference of more than one impact level, this practice may
be judged high risk and be prohibited by local security policy.



                                                                                                             Page 32
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



challenge to the card to verify that the card holds the private key corresponding to the certificate.
The authentication certificate is then added to the server’s database, along with any other
information about the individual that the server maintains (e.g., the individual’s authorizations).
Since certificate revocation is used as a mechanism to indicate that a PIV Card should no longer
be considered valid, the caching status proxy should periodically re-validate all of the certificates
in its database and deactivate the access privileges of any individual whose certificate has expired
or has been revoked. Re-validation should be performed by the caching status proxy at least once
per day. Once the decision has been made to revoke a PIN credential, agencies may employ local
de-authorization methods to supplement revocation and achieve a more rapid local effect.
When an individual presents his or her PIV Card to a door reader, the door reader obtains the
authentication certificate from the card, sends a challenge to the card, and then uses the public
key in the certificate to verify the response to the challenge.
        Recommendation: The CHUID may be collected at registration, but it should be
        treated as if it were a password (since digital signature provides entropy equivalent
        to a password) for purposes of retention, i.e., hashed, the hash stored, and the
        CHUID deleted. A stored CHUID presents risks similar to a stored password; it
        can be copied and used to gain access. Data elements may be extracted from the
        CHUID and retained (e.g., the FASC-N, Data Universal Numbering System
        (DUNS) Number, and Global Unique Identifier (GUID)), and a retained hash is
        sufficient to enable verification. NIST strongly recommends against the storage of
        complete CHUIDs in relying systems.
        Recommendation: PKI and asymmetric CAK authentication mechanisms should
        be implemented by a PACS reader capable of full certificate path validation, either
        on-line or using a caching status proxy. Agencies should consider using on-line
        status checks as a means to reduce the latency of PIV Card status when a PIV Card
        is used for access to Exclusion areas. If a caching status proxy is used, the
        certificates should be captured when the PIV Card is registered to the PACS.

7.5   Credential Validation and Path Validation
Credential validation is the process of determining if a presented identity credential is valid, i.e.,
was legitimately issued and has not expired or been terminated. On-line credential validation is
extremely valuable to relying parties because it retrieves the most up-to-date credential status, and
can block fraudulent use of a PIV Card that has been terminated as lost or stolen. Credential
validation is required by the PKI authentication mechanism, and can be implemented for BIO,
BIO-A, CAK, and CHUID authentication mechanisms.
FIPS 201 Section 5.4.5 states, “The presence of a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked PIV
authentication certificate on a card is proof that the card was issued and is not revoked.” FIPS
201 Section 6.2 further says, “The status of the PIV authentication certificate is directly tied to the
status of all other credential elements held by the card.” These statements imply that PIV
credential validation may be done by performing path validation (see below) on the PIV
Authentication Key certificate or Card Authentication Key certificate.
Since the expiration date of a PIV Card is contained in the CHUID, a relying party can determine
if a PIV Card has expired by reading the CHUID, verifying the CHUID’s signature, then
extracting and comparing the expiration date with the current date received from a trusted source.
On-line, on-demand credential validation may not always be practical, due to absence of network
connectivity to the PCI, or inadequate response time. In these circumstances, it may be possible
for PIV Cards of interest to be registered with a caching status proxy. The caching status proxy


                                                                                              Page 33
Special Publication 800-116                         A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



can poll the status of all registered cards periodically, and cache the status responses from their
issuer(s). Relying parties will see quick query-response service from the caching status proxy.
The cache status should be updated at least once every 24 hours.
         Recommendation: On-line credential validation should be implemented for all of the
         FIPS 201 authentication mechanisms whenever possible. It is especially important when
         the one-factor, non-biometric mechanisms (CHUID, CAK) are used, because they could
         be exploited by simple possession of a misappropriated PIV Card. Caching techniques
         can be used to implement credential validation when on-line, on-demand credential
         validation is not possible. It is also recommended that the cached data be protected
         against tampering.
Data objects read from a smart card by a reader should not be fully trusted as authentic (i.e.,
produced by a PCI) and unmodified until their digital signatures are verified. Most data objects
in a PIV card-application have embedded digital signatures (i.e., all certificates, the CHUID,
fingerprint template, facial image, and security object). The Printed Information Buffer must be
signed by the Security Object, and the Card Capability Container may be signed by the Security
Object.
Path validation (or trust path validation) is the process of verifying the binding between the
subject identifier and subject public key in a certificate, based on the public key of a trust anchor,
through the validation of a chain of certificates that begins with a certificate issued by the trust
anchor and ends with the target certificate. The public key of a trust anchor is implicitly trusted
by the relying party (generally, this means it was installed into the relying system by means of a
trusted process, such as a direct device-to-device copy). Full trust in a PIV authentication
mechanism requires that path validation succeed for each PIV data object used by the
mechanism. 11
The PKI authentication mechanism requires path validation to be performed on the PIV
Authentication Key certificate. FIPS 201 does not require that path validation be performed for
the BIO, BIO-A, CHUID, and CAK authentication mechanisms; however, these authentication
mechanisms can be fully trusted only if path validation is performed. In the absence of path
validation, an impostor could forge a fingerprint template and a CHUID object, for example, with
signatures from a phony Certification Authority. BIO authentication would succeed with this
counterfeit PIV Card, and the forgery would not be detected.
Because credential validation is a special case of path validation, both services can be
economically implemented by a single PACS service component.
         Recommendation: Path validation should be performed on all signed data objects
         required by the authentication mechanism in use. Path validation should employ on-line
         credential validation where possible, or cached certificate status where on-line certificate
         validation is not possible.

7.6    Lost PIV Card or Suspicion of Fraudulent Use
If a lost PIV Card is found by a person other than the cardholder, or if a pattern of PIV Card
activity raises suspicions of fraudulent use, the security office of the issuing agency, or of the
cardholder’s duty station, should be notified. The security office (issuing and local duty station)
will determine if further investigation is warranted and if the PCI should be asked to terminate the


11
   If a data object is not used in the authentication mechanism being performed, path validation need not be performed
on the data object’s digital signature for the authentication result to be fully trusted.

PIV Card. In the event of PIV Card termination, the PCI will request the Certification Authority
to revoke certificates on the PIV Card.

8.         PACS Use Cases

HSPD-12 requires that PIV credentials include graduated criteria, from least secure to most
secure, for authentication to ensure flexibility in selecting the appropriate level of security for
each application. PIV credentials, as defined in FIPS 201, offer a range of security which is
discussed in Section 7. This section provides recommendations for the appropriate use of
graduated security in PIV credentials for the PACS.
PIV credentials can be used at Federally-owned buildings or leased spaces, single or multi-tenant
occupancy, commercial spaces shared with non-government tenants, and government-owned
contractor-operated facilities. This includes existing and new construction or major
modernizations, standalone facilities, and Federal campuses. Thus, PIV credentials apply to
facilities requiring varying levels of security with differing security requirements.
To begin, the agency must know the security requirements for its facility. Since this is beyond
the scope of this document, it is assumed that the agency has completed its facility security risk
assessment. It is also assumed that the agency is using the FSL Determination 12 to derive the
security requirement for its facility. The FSL takes into account size and population, as well as
several other factors that capture the value of the facility to the government and to potential
adversaries. Other factors, including mission criticality, symbolism, and threat to tenant agency,
are also considered. For the purposes of protecting assets and placement of proper security
measures, size and population may not be as important as the mission criticality, symbolism, and
threat to the tenant agency. Although there is no simple one-to-one mapping between FSL and
the authentication mechanism(s), the FSL indicates the general risk to the facility. Based on the
FSL, an agency should identify and categorize PACS perimeters as protecting Controlled,
Limited, or Exclusion areas. Appropriate security measures can then be implemented based on
the areas identified for the facility in consultation with the real property authority and legal
authority. This section provides example use cases of PIV authentication mechanisms in the
following facility environments:

       +     Single-Tenant Facility—A facility that only includes a Federal tenant, or multiple
             components of the same department or agency that fall under one “umbrella” for security
             purposes.

       +     Multi-Tenant Facility—A facility that includes tenants from multiple Federal
             departments and agencies, but no non-Federal tenants.

       +     Mixed-Multi-Tenant Facility—A facility that includes tenants from multiple Federal
             departments and agencies as well as one or more non-Federal tenants.

       +     Single-Tenant Campus—Federal facilities with two or more buildings surrounded (and
             thus defined) by a perimeter.

       +     Multi-Tenant Campus—Two or more Federal facilities located contiguous to one another
             and typically sharing some aspects of the environment, such as parking, courtyards,
             private vehicle access roads or gates, entrances to connected facilities, etc. May also be
             referred to as a “Federal center” or “Complex”.

8.1   Single-Tenant Facility
In single-tenant facilities, a single tenant defines its own security requirements and controls its
own security measures. Implementation of security measures is uniform. The facility may be an
owned or a leased space. If the space is leased, the tenant usually can impose security
requirements based on its needs. This type of facility may range from FSL I to FSL V.
Therefore, it may have LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH value assets to protect. Facilities
evaluated at FSL I or II may not implement PACS and may continue without PACS. Facilities
evaluated at FSL III or above should implement PACS. These facilities may have general access
areas where individual identification and authentication is not possible, or necessary. In this case,
the agency should establish at least one perimeter beyond which individual authentication is
required and conducted with PACS. Figure 8-1 is an example of a Single-Tenant facility. The
figure shows a building with multiple floors occupied by one tenant. The one security perimeter
is the Lobby where the cardholder authentication takes place. This one-perimeter facility should
be designated as a Controlled, Limited, or Exclusion area and the appropriate authentication
mechanisms should be selected from Figure 7-1.

8.2   Multi-Tenant Facility
The challenge with a multi-tenant facility is to meet the security policies and requirements of the
individual tenants in the facility. Some tenants may need higher security than others. The
security policies may not be uniform and cannot be imposed upon others. In this situation, a
collective (also known as the Building Security Committee) determination has to be made by the
designated officials (representatives for each Federal tenant), the owning or leasing department or
agency, and the security organization responsible for the facility to identify appropriate areas
within the facility. In the end, the decision may be to implement the highest necessary security
for the entire facility or to apply the lowest security to the facility while affording individual
agencies additional security.
If the highest security is implemented for the entire facility, there is one security perimeter and
the security posture is no different from a single-tenant facility. Otherwise, the multi-tenant



                                                                                              Page 37
Special Publication 800-116                A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



facility may be viewed as an outer and inner perimeter where different security can be
implemented. The outer perimeter is the most common security measure that all the tenants
agreed to and the inner perimeter is an agency-specific security measure. For example, the
facility may designate Controlled area at the outer perimeter but one of the tenant agencies may
require Exclusion area protection. Access to the building may be generally satisfied with a
Controlled area authentication mechanism, but the individual agency should implement an
Exclusion area authentication mechanism for access to its floor(s). In this example, the building
is the outer perimeter while access to an individual floor is the inner perimeter.
Since there are multiple tenants in the facility, it is strongly recommended that each individual
tenant designate its own “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas and employ appropriate FIPS 201
authentication mechanisms as in Figure 7-1. Since by definition the multi-tenant facility hosts
Federal government employees and contractors, the outer perimeter can be PIV-enabled and
individual agencies may piggyback on the authentication performed at the outer perimeter.
Figure 8-2 is an example of a multi-tenant facility. The building lobby is the outer perimeter
implementing PIV-enabled PACS, while the individual tenants implement additional security
perimeters for stronger cardholder authentication.

8.3   Mixed-Multi-Tenant Facility
The mixed-multi-tenant facility use case is an example of a facility with a mix of PIV cardholders
and non-PIV cardholders. Therefore, some tenants in this facility may not possess PIV Cards for
authentication. It may be difficult if not impossible to develop one acceptable security policy for
all the tenants. The Federal tenants in this facility should ensure they have leverage to implement
necessary PIV authentication mechanisms for access to their space. The tenant agencies should
designate their own “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas and then evaluate if the facility’s
PACS will accommodate their security needs. Each Federal government tenant should ensure an
appropriate PIV authentication mechanism from Table 7-1 is implemented for its designated
areas. If the facility’s PACS cannot accommodate agencies’ security needs, the tenant agencies
should establish their own PACS. This may be considered an inner perimeter to the facility. In
this case, the outer perimeter (i.e., access to the building) does not provide any authentication
context. The individual agency should manage its own PACS server and user access. In many
cases, the tenant agency will not have the authority to implement security measures
independently; however, relationships in place should be used to negotiate security measures.


                                                                                           Page 38
Special Publication 800-116                 A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



In the event that it is not possible to establish individual PACS and the facility is evaluated at FSL
III or above, the tenant should consider the risk involved with inadequate security and make
future plans to improve security posture in accordance with the PIMM model in Section 9.

8.4     Single-Tenant Campus
As opposed to a single-tenant facility, a campus is a collection of buildings, labs, and parking
spaces that are geographically co-located within a large perimeter. The large perimeter is
typically a fenced compound with a gate through which Federal employees, contractors, and
visitors gain access. This type of a facility may be assessed at FSL III or above simply due to its
population and size. All the areas within the campus may not have the same security
requirements. Some spaces may be generally accessible to campus visitors, while some may be
specialized spaces such as a high-security lab or a chemical storage area that require a higher
level of security protection. In this scenario, one security measure for all spaces might be
overbearing and hamper business processes. The campus environment can be further
characterized as one big perimeter (outer perimeter) and multiple smaller (inner) perimeters.
There are interdependencies between these perimeters that are further elaborated through the
“Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas.
In the campus environment, a cumulative effect of authentication is achieved as an individual
traverses boundaries from unrestricted to Controlled to Limited to Exclusion areas. In other
words, authentication performed to gain access to a Controlled area should not be repeated to gain
access to a Limited area. Instead, a complementary evidence of identity should be used to
achieve multi-factor authentication of the individual who requests access to the Limited area.
The same logic applies to the Exclusion area.
Spaces within a campus may have varying degrees of security. The campus may be subdivided
into “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas. Moreover, a campus may have one or more areas
that are subdivided. A single Controlled or Limited area may be divided into sub-areas for
purposes of discretionary or Need-To-Know access control. As a matter of local policy, the use
of single-factor authentication may be sufficient to access sub-areas within the same Controlled
or Limited area.
The following sections discuss the use of PIV authentication mechanisms in a campus
environment with multiple perimeters. This document does not address non-PIV authentication
mechanisms.

8.4.1    FSL I or II Campus Facility
Figure 8-3 depicts a security posture of a FSL I or II Campus Facility. It includes one or more
Controlled areas that are available to authorized personnel. Since a FSL I or II Campus Facility
can be considered a low-risk area, a PACS may or may not be maintained to preclude
unauthorized entries. When PACS is maintained, SOME confidence in the identity of the
cardholder should be achieved. Implementation of PIV authentication mechanisms for Controlled
areas would be an appropriate countermeasure for security at this facility. CHUID + VIS, CAK,
or BIO are the three recommended authentication mechanisms in this environment. Note that
these authentication mechanisms validate “something you have” or “something you are” (one-
factor authentication).

8.4.2   FSL III Campus Facility
Figure 8-4 depicts a security posture of a FSL III Campus Facility. It includes one or more
Controlled areas as well as Limited areas that are restricted to specific group of individuals.
Since a FSL III Campus Facility can be considered a moderate-risk facility, a PACS should
provide additional security to the more valuable assets. HIGH confidence in the identity of the
cardholder should be achieved for access to the Limited area. Note that the entire facility does
not need the highest level of security. Access to the Limited area should be complemented with
the authentication already completed at the Controlled area. Implementation of BIO-A or PKI
authentication mechanisms would be an appropriate countermeasure for the Limited area. Note
that these authentication mechanisms validate “something you are” or “something you know”
(another factor in authentication).

                              Figure 8-5: FSL IV or V Campus Facility
Although there is not a simple one-to-one mapping between FSLs and PACS Identity
Authentication Assurance Levels at access control points, generally higher-risk areas will need
stronger identity assurance. Since a FSL IV or V facility is considered a high-risk area, a PACS
should achieve VERY HIGH confidence in the identity of the cardholder for access to the
Exclusion areas. Note that the entire facility does not need the highest level of confidence in the
identity of the cardholder. For access to the Exclusion areas, three-factor authentication should
be achieved. This can be accomplished in multiple ways, as shown in Figure 7-2.

8.5     Multi-Tenant Campus
The multi-tenant campus environment is similar to the single-tenant campus except that
individual tenants will have their own security policies and the enforcement may be different. A
tenant may benefit from the authentication mechanism(s) implemented at the outer perimeter;
however, agencies may implement their own PACS within their space. In this case, if an agency
were to benefit from other agencies’ PACS, its PACS should have communication links with
other PACS on the campus.
Once again, each individual tenant within a campus should designate its own “Controlled,
Limited, Exclusion” areas and identify appropriate PIV authentication mechanism(s) required for
access to its space (see Figure 7-1). The tenants can then determine if they can simply use the
campus PACS application, if they should add security by implementing an additional PIV
authentication mechanism, or if they should implement a stand-alone PACS. Each individual
tenant should ensure that appropriate PIV authentication mechanism(s) from Figure 7-1 are
implemented for its designated areas.




                                                                                            Page 41
Special Publication 800-116                    A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



8.6       Role-Based Access Control
Authorization of identities enrolled in a PACS is viewed as separate from cardholder
authentication. PACS may grant access only to cardholders who were enrolled and authorized in
the PACS Server prior to presenting their credentials for authentication, or they may make on-
the-fly access control decisions by evaluating the information on presented PIV Cards against a
set of access control rules. Because PIV Cards contain only a few mandatory subject attributes
(just the Agency Code, Employee Affiliation, and Investigation Status Indicator) that may be
used for role-based access control, role or group permissions will usually be derived from off-
card information. In the future, standardized role information may be available on-card,
especially for Emergency Response Officials or Continuity of Operations (COOP) procedures.
           Recommendation: Because having on-card role and permission information
           would raise difficult challenges concerning update and revocation, PACS
           permissions should generally be stored in a PACS facilities-based component, such
           as a panel or controller database.

8.7       Temporary Badges
HSPD-12 mandated the issuance of electronic identity credentials to Federal employees and
contractors. OMB Memorandum M-05-24 clarified the eligibility requirements for PIV Cards to
temporary Federal employees and contractors, by requiring PIV Card issuance to all Federal
employees and contractors who require access to Federal facilities or information systems for
more than six months. [M-05-24] Agencies are permitted to issue non-PIV Cards to individuals
with access of less than six months. Ineligible personnel (i.e., visitors who are neither Federal
employees nor contractors), temporary personnel requiring access for less than six months,
eligible personnel who, as a matter of agency policy, are not issued PIV Cards, and PIV
cardholders who have forgotten their cards comprise the people who could receive temporary
badges. Temporary badges will thus be necessary (although in smaller numbers than before) for
the indefinite future.
An agency or facility should consider the relationship of temporary badges to PIV Cards and their
PACS system(s) when selecting temporary badge products. Factors to consider during the
procurement process include:

      +    The OMB M-05-24 requirement that temporary badges be visually and electronically
           distinguishable from PIV Cards. [M-05-24]

      +    Capabilities and costs of enrollment stations, which will likely be local to the facility for
           best turnaround time.

      +    The interoperability of temporary badges with HSPD-12 readers and authentication
           mechanisms (especially CHUID and CAK for physical access).

      +    The assignment of FASC-N unique identifiers to temporary badges, to foster
           interoperability with HSPD-12 readers.

      +    The suitability of contactless-only temporary badges for physical access.

      +    The performance, cost, and security tradeoffs between disposable and reusable temporary
           badges.

      +    The importance of VIS authentication mechanisms with temporary badges.


                                                                                                 Page 42
Special Publication 800-116                A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



Many approaches to temporary badges are possible. A two-tier approach could become
commonplace. A paper-based tier would provide disposable paper badges, with or without
printed ID photos. A smart-card tier would issue a reusable card with greater functionality,
possibly using PIV Card stock, with capability for physical access, interoperability with HSPD-12
readers and use cases, for periods of weeks to six months.

8.8   Disaster Response and Recovery Incidents
In addition to the use of a PIV credential for cardholder authentication during routine everyday
use, the PIV credentials may also be used for access to Federal facilities and Federally controlled
areas internal to disaster response and recovery incident scenes. Federal agencies should consider
access for personnel from agencies with responsibilities under the National Response
Framework, National Incident Management System, National Infrastructure Protection Plan, and
the National Continuity Policy Implementation Plan when identifying and categorizing PACS
perimeters as protecting Controlled, Limited, and Exclusion areas. Subsequently, agencies
should apply appropriate (in accordance with Table 7-2) PIV authentication mechanisms to the
areas to ensure that incident management personnel, emergency response providers, and other
personnel (including temporary personnel) and resources likely needed to respond to a natural
disaster, act of terrorism, or other manmade disaster can be electronically authenticated in order
to attain movement internal to Federally controlled facilities and areas within the incident scene.

9.     Migration Strategy

Earlier sections provide the tools agencies will need to prepare a migration plan for PIV enabling
their PACS environment. This section discusses how these tools may be used to aid agencies
with developing a migration plan.

9.1    Project Planning
Planning for a migration to PIV-enabled PACS should be viewed as an opportunity to modernize
deployed PACS. Given the threat environment, as described in Section 4, migrating to PIV-
enabled PACS enhances security, fosters trust among agencies, and creates cost efficiencies. This
section provides a strategy for developing migration plans, as shown in Figure 9-1.

                                Figure 9-1: Migration Strategy
Planning should be risk-based. Not all access points will require the same level of authentication
assurance. Therefore, it is important to start with the risk assessment, which distills into PACS
requirements. A migration plan can then be developed to help the agency transition to the desired
PIV-enabled PACS environment.

9.2    Risk Assessment
Vulnerability analyses and risk assessments provide a method of prioritizing the criticality of
assets (or the impact of the loss of assets), threats, and countermeasure strategies. A structured
process allows for the documentation of risks by subject matter experts based on their judgments
and assumptions. The final product is a broad set of priorities, both physical and cyber, that
contribute to the protection of the critical systems or functions.
The input to this assessment is the understanding of risks in the current environment.
Specifically, knowledge of existing vulnerabilities and the impact of attacks should be attained.
Section 4 provides attack vectors that must be well-understood and acted upon. The goal should
be to embed the countermeasures against the identified threats in migration to PIV-enabled
PACS. HSPD-12 requires the standard to provide graduated levels of security in PIV credentials.
Note that the combination of one or more authentication mechanisms must be employed to
mitigate the counterfeiting, skimming, sniffing, social engineering, and cloning threats.




                                                                                                    Page 44

9.3     Business and Functional Requirements
Each agency has a unique operational environment. Agencies vary in size, organizational
structure, and geographic topography. Moreover, their PACS requirements are driven by their
mission and by risk and vulnerability assessment. The result is today’s PACS environment,
which is site-specific and hardly interoperable with other agency implementations. HSPD-12
adds two requirements to these implementations, namely enhanced security and government-wide
use of common identification. In other words, an identity credential issued by agency A must be
usable by agency B. Note that HSPD-12 leaves the authorization decision to individual agencies.
Section 6 provides characteristics of a future PIV-enabled PACS system that substantiates the
goals of HSPD-12. Agencies are encouraged to use these characteristics to determine business
and functional requirements applicable to their environment.

9.4     Develop Migration Plan
Developing a migration plan requires a vision for PIV-enabled PACS operations. Specifically, a
new business process needs to be charted to address the use of PIV credentials. This business
process will be dependent on the flexibility available in changing the current environment. Some
agencies may be renting spaces where access control is managed by someone else. In the end,
however, an agency should have a plan to use the PIV Card.
The OMB Circular Number A-11, Part 7, Section 300: Planning, Budgeting, Acquisitions, and
Management of Capital Assets establishes policy for the planning, budgeting, acquisition, and
management of Federal capital assets, and provides introduction on budget justification and
reporting requirements for major IT investments for Federal agencies. OMB Circular A-11 spells
out the requirements for supporting several legislative directives including, but not limited to, the
Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which requires agencies to use a disciplined capital planning and
investment control (CPIC) process to acquire, use, maintain and dispose of information
technology. In particular, the Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) specifically instructs the head of each
executive agency to establish effective and efficient capital planning processes for selecting,
managing, and evaluating the results of all of its major investments in information systems.
In migration planning, agencies should first determine the level of identity assurance required to
gain access to their resources. Guidelines on determining the level of identity assurance and
selecting a corresponding authentication mechanism are provided in Section 7 of this document.
Once authentication mechanisms are selected, agencies will need to identify technology gaps in
the existing system. The gaps may be in the existing readers, control panels, or PACS servers.
Section 8 discusses prominent scenarios and provides recommendations on filling technology
gaps.
It is recommended that agencies plan to ultimately reach the highest level of authentication
assurance that displays all the qualities identified in Section 6.2. For this, guidance is provided in
the following section to enable agencies to progress in stages.

9.5     Migration Strategy & Tactics
Continuity of operations planning is essential to the success of a migration from deployed PACS
to PIV-enabled PACS. Planning lays the strategic framework that makes tactical, moment-to-
moment change management possible without catastrophic disruptions. This section suggests
sample strategies that can help the tactics succeed.
      1. Encourage the project staff to train themselves. In parallel with project planning, create
         opportunities for the project staff to learn by doing on a small scale.



                                                                                             Page 45
Special Publication 800-116                  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



      2. Budget the project carefully. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of a complete PIV-
         enabled PACS system may be less than the TCO of an upgraded system.
      3. In order for any PIV implementation to be successful, cross-departmental collaboration is
         imperative. The needs of operational units left out of the process may not be fully
         understood.
      4. Look for project synergies. For example, PACS modernization may contribute to facility
         monitoring, and emergency access policies for First Responders may trigger reevaluation
         of PACS role models and authentication methods.
      5. Develop a relationship with a senior partner. A “senior partner” should be farther along
         in implementation, or have deeper expertise, than your organization.
      6. Consider acquiring access system components that are software and hardware
         upgradeable to meet anticipated future requirements. For example, an agency may not
         see the need for contact interfaces at this time; however, it should look to purchase
         products that either have a dual-interface (contact and contactless capability) or plug-in
         for contact card readers. The agency may have a choice to add contact readers without
         replacing the reader infrastructure.
      7. Use the extra bandwidth to support remote monitoring and diagnosis, off-loading of
         service elements, credential validation, cryptographic key management, and so on.
      8. Initially, buy multifunction readers that read both deployed and PIV Cards and can
         perform all PIV electronic use cases—they can be used anywhere. Care should be taken
         to avoid identifier collisions between two technologies. The agency should design to the
         highest authentication assurance level that it thinks it may require in the future.
         Multifunction readers can also implement the authentication mechanism agility required
         by changing Threat Conditions.
      9. As experience and the number of deployed readers grow, select more restricted and cost-
         effective readers implementing just the required authentication mechanisms.
      10. Avoid long-term, side-by-side operation of deployed and PIV technologies. Once PIV
          Cards have been issued to half the users, cut costs by aggressive completion of the
          migration.


9.6     PIV Implementation Maturity Model (PIMM)
In a document focused on the integration of PIV authentication mechanisms with PACS systems,
it is impossible to provide detailed recommendations on project planning for PACS modifications
or upgrades. The planning space is simply too large, due to the variations in local requirements,
the asset inventory and impact assessment, project size, the installed base of electronic PACS
systems, requirements for integration with other facilities’ infrastructure subsystems, etc.
Instead, we recommend in this section a PIMM that can be used to measure the progress of a
facility or an agency towards a complete PIV implementation. The PIMM should be applied only
to facilities that have established a requirement for an electronic PACS.
The PIMM is organized around the assumption of three enclosing perimeters: the Controlled area,
the Limited area, and the Exclusion area, shown in Figure 7-1. In a general sense, “Controlled,
Limited, Exclusion” areas may be considered as the security perimeters consistent with protection




                                                                                             Page 46
Special Publication 800-116                       A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



of low, moderate, and high impact assets, respectively. The following PIMM maturity levels
begin by achieving some capability and experience with PIV-based PACS:
         1. Maturity Level 1—Ad Hoc PIV Verification. A site has the ability to authenticate
            PIV Cards by performing required authentication mechanisms on an ad hoc, on-
            demand basis. For example, card and cardholder authentication is achieved with a
            handheld terminal or a specific personal computer (PC), for special or occasional
            uses.
         2. Maturity Level 2—Systematic PIV Verification to Controlled Area. At the outer
            perimeter of the site (Controlled area), PIV Cards are accepted as proof of identity,
            possibly in addition to currently deployed non-PIV PACS cards. A visitor
            registration procedure exists to accept PIV Cards and if necessary convert PIV
            authentication to a currently deployed non-PIV PACS card.
         3. Maturity Level 3—Access to Exclusion Areas by PIV or Exception Only. Access to
            Exclusion areas (the most sensitive areas) is permitted by PIV authentication or
            "exception" only. Here, exceptions are the exceptions to PIV issuance (e.g., less than
            six months association). However, all access to exclusion areas is also subject to
            authorization, and authorization would typically only be granted to PIV cardholders.
            The exception case might be applied to exclusion areas for Very Important Person
            (VIP) visitors, for example. At Level 3, currently deployed non-PIV PACS cards are
            not acceptable for authentication to exclusion areas.
         4. Maturity Level 4—Access to Exclusion and Limited Areas by PIV or Exception
            Only. Access to Limited areas (generally, those permitting clearance level- or role-
            based authorization) is permitted by PIV authentication or exception only. At Level
            4, currently deployed non-PIV PACS cards are not acceptable for authentication to
            Exclusion or Limited areas. BIO, BIO-A, or PKI are acceptable authentication
            mechanisms in Limited Areas for authorized PIV cardholders.
         5. Maturity Level 5—Access to Exclusion, Limited, or Controlled Areas by PIV or
            Exception Only. Access to Controlled areas (showing evidence of organizational
            affiliation, or registration for a visitor, with or without escort) is permitted by PIV
            authentication or exception only. At Level 5, currently deployed non-PIV PACS
            cards are not acceptable for authentication to any areas. That is, only the PIV Card is
            an acceptable credential for Federal employees and contractors.
The first two recommended maturity levels achieve some capability and experience with PIV
authentication mechanisms. This capability may exist in parallel with deployed PACS, and after
Level 2, the facility has achieved a capability to accept PIV Cards from visitors for access to
Controlled areas. The next three maturity levels displace deployed PACS to Exclusion, Limited,
and Controlled areas, beginning with the highest-impact areas (with, presumably, the smallest
number of access control points and authorized subjects) and moving to the Controlled area (with
the largest number of access control points and authorized subjects). At Level 5, the entire
facility has been converted to PIV authentication mechanisms at all access points, and/or all
subjects, where it is required and appropriate 13 .
Maturity levels are progressive: for example, achieving Level 2 requires satisfying all of the
requirements of Level 1 in addition to the requirements of Level 2. Maturity levels can be

13
   Note that some use of methods other than FIPS 201 authentication mechanisms will continue because not everyone is
eligible or required to have a PIV Card.



                                                                                                          Page 47
Special Publication 800-116                   A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



applied to individual facilities, or by extension to multiple facilities within a bureau or agency.
When applied to multiple facilities, a maturity level is achieved when each of the facilities in the
group has achieved the maturity level individually.

9.7       PIV-in-PACS Best Practices
HSPD-12 mandates the establishment of government wide identity credentials and the use of
these credentials in gaining physical access to Federally controlled facilities. This implies that a
PACS application installed at these facilities should interoperate with the credential standardized
by [FIPS201], the PIV Card, issued by any government agency. The PIV Card interface and data
model requirements are fully specified through [FIPS201] and companion documents. For the
PACS application (or PIV-enabled PACS application), the following best practices are
recommended.

      +    PACS application providers should only employ products that are approved through the
           FIPS 201 evaluation program where the evaluation program product categories are
           applicable. [FIPS 201 Evaluation Program]

      +    For each access transaction, once the applicable authentication mechanisms are satisfied,
           all PACS access decisions are based on utilization of the complete FASC-N Identifier
           (match of the 14 digit Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number) which is
           unique across Federal government agencies.

      +    The PACS application that uses PKI or asymmetric CAK authentication mechanisms
           should support all of the asymmetric algorithms specified in Table 3-1 of [SP800-78].

      +    Each facility should be mapped to the “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” model and an
           assignment of PIV authentication mechanisms to all access control points in accordance
           with Section 7.1.

      +    Signature verification and path validation should be performed on all signed data objects
           in the PIV authentication mechanisms used.

      +    On-line credential validation should be implemented for all authentication mechanisms
           whenever connectivity is available. Caching techniques may be used to reduce
           connectivity requirements.

      +    The CHUID authentication mechanism should be implemented in only two situations: 1)
           access control points separating two areas at the same impact level, either Controlled or
           Limited; and 2) combined with the VIS authentication mechanism at access points
           between Unrestricted and Controlled areas. See Section 4.9.

      +    The CHUID data object may be read from the PIV Card and used for registration and
           authentication transactions, but should not be retained in a PACS or other relying system
           after the transaction is complete. If the values of the CHUID data fields must be retained,
           the asymmetric signature of the CHUID should be deleted.

      +    All PACS applications should operate at PIMM Level 5.




                                                                                             Page 48

10.   Future Topics

This section describes advances in FIPS 201 and its associated document suite, and in the
architecture and implementation of the PIV infrastructure, that are recommended to realize the
full potential of the authentication mechanisms used by PACS.

10.1 Generalized Credential Identifier
FIPS 201 states that the CHUID data object contains the FASC-N data element, “which uniquely
identifies each card.” The FASC-N actually serves two purposes: 1) identifying a PIV Card (and
by correspondence, the cardholder); and 2) binding PIV data objects to the same PIV Card,
because the identical FASC-N is contained in the CHUID, the PIV Authentication Key
certificate, the Card Authentication Key certificate, the fingerprint biometric record, and the
facial image object.
Within the FASC-N, the fundamental card identifier is the (Agency Code, System Code, and
Credential Number) triplet called the FASC-N Identifier. Uniqueness of the triplet is derived
from a hierarchical approach to number assignment. The Agency Code field is statically assigned
to a department, agency, or bureau through a registration process, and the assigned Agency Code
values are listed in NIST SP 800-87. [SP800-87] The PIV Card Issuer for the registered
department, agency, or bureau can, in turn, assign the System Code and Credential Number.
The FASC-N, as adopted and extended by FIPS 201, meets the objective of HSPD-12 to identify
Federal employees and contractors. The success of the FIPS 201 technical standard has led other
communities of interest to consider PIV-like identification systems. For some of these
communities the FASC-N Identifier is not an appropriate solution since they are not agencies of
the Federal government. Also, the data representation of the FASC-N was chosen for
compatibility with deployed systems (fixed-length hexadecimal), and may not be optimal for
binary identifier values prevalent in commercial systems today.
For these reasons, the CHUID data object also contains the GUID data element for future use.
The GUID is a 16-byte, or 128-bit, binary field. It therefore improves on both the length and
representation limitations of the FASC-N. Unfortunately, the GUID is only present in the
CHUID, and does not serve to bind other data objects together. If the GUID were used to identify
a PIV Card, the standard in effect would still require the FASC-N in the other data objects.
These issues lead to a number of questions. If a community outside the Federal government
adopts PIV-like technology, what identifier format, registrar, and governance structure should
they use? How could larger, binary identifiers be used with PIV-like technology? Could
existing, standardized universal identifiers such as the Universal Unique Identifier (UUID),
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses, OpenID identifiers, or Object Identifiers (OIDs) be
used in place of the FASC-N, in all of its uses? If non-Federal-government communities adopt
identifiers other than the FASC-N, could FIPS 201 be modified to recognize multiple types of
identifiers?
        Recommendation: Agencies should collaborate to standardize an enhancement or
        replacement of the FASC-N that accomplishes both credential identification and
        object binding, and supports an extensible framework for subject identification.

10.2 Secure Biometric Match-On-Card
FIPS 201 defines the biometric authentication mechanisms BIO and BIO-A. According to these
definitions, the PIV reference template object is stored on the PIV Card during issuance. When a
PIV Card is inserted into a contact biometric reader and the PIN has been entered, the biometric
reader can read the reference template object from the PIV Card. The subject presents a finger to
a fingerprint scanner on the biometric reader, and the reader acquires a sample template from the
scan. The reader then performs the matching algorithm comparing the reference and sample
templates, and produces a Yes or No response. This is known as Match-Off-Card biometric
authentication.
Biometric Match-On-Card is similar, but performs the match on the PIV Card instead of on the
reader. To do this, the sample template must be sent to the reader, but the reference template
need not leave the PIV Card. Secure Biometric Match-On-Card combines Biometric Match-On-
Card with a secure communication protocol that encrypts the sample template as transmitted into
the PIV Card, and signs a Yes or No result returned to the reader.
Secure Biometric Match-On-Card (SBMOC) has important benefits over Match-Off-Card.
Communication of sensitive biometric data is always encrypted and can be decrypted only by the
PIV Card. The subject’s reference template is never released from the PIV Card. The biometric
match is performed in the trusted execution environment of the PIV Card. ISO/IEC 7816 secure
messaging commands and asymmetric cryptography mean that only the PIV Card can decrypt the
biometric data and sign the result. [ISO/IEC7816] Moreover, the cardholder PIN is not required
to perform the transaction. Because of the secure communication protocol and no PIN
requirement, SBMOC can be performed safely and quickly over a contactless interface. Finally,
because the match is performed on the PIV Card, the card knows and can use the result of the
match.
NIST recently completed the Secure Biometric Match-On-Card Feasibility Study, as reported in
NISTIR 7452 [SBMOC] and the companion MINEX II report [MINEXII]. The results of the
SBMOC study show 17 cards successfully implemented the functionality and security
requirements of the study, and met the 2.5 second transaction time goal. The MINEX II results
indicate that one of the tested cards approached the accuracy of ANSI 378 matching algorithms,
thereby exceeding the accuracy requirements of FIPS 201 as defined in [SP800-76]. Three
additional smart cards and Match-On-Card algorithms met some, but not all, of the criteria.
        Recommendation: SBMOC should be pursued as a standard FIPS 201
        authentication mechanism, especially for PACS. Assuming it is judged to be at
        least as trustworthy as PIN entry, SBMOC should be allowed to substitute for PIN
        to activate a PIV Card.

Appendix A—Recommendations

Section 2.2
        Recommendation: The OMB Memorandum [M-08-01] requires that the
        credential issuance be accomplished by October 27, 2008 (or by the date specified
        in the implementation plan mutually agreed-upon by the agency and OMB).
        Agency implementation plans should be written to accomplish the goals of HSPD-
        12.
Section 2.3
        Recommendation: This document recommends a risk-based approach for
        selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms to manage physical access to
        Federal government facilities and assets. Agencies should seek recommendations
        on PACS architectures, authorization, and facility protection from other sources.
Section 4.9
        Recommendation: This section emphasizes the technical risks that remain with
        the CHUID authentication mechanism. If the CHUID authentication mechanism
        were implemented without restriction, operational risk would increase as the value
        of targets and the availability of cloning and counterfeiting tools increase. NIST
        therefore recommends that the CHUID authentication mechanism be implemented
        in only two situations: 1) access control points separating two areas at the same
        impact level, either Controlled or Limited; and 2) combined with the VIS
        authentication mechanism at access points between Unrestricted and Controlled
        areas. See Section 7 for further detail. NIST further recommends that the
        asymmetric CAK authentication mechanism be used instead of the CHUID
        authentication mechanism to the greatest extent practical.
Section 6.1
        Recommendation: To obtain the full benefit of PIV interoperability, HSPD-12
        project managers should ensure that relying systems have the capability to use all
        cryptographic algorithms that apply to the authentication mechanism(s) performed.
        Departments and agencies should procure and deploy HSPD-12 products on the
        GSA HSPD-12 Evaluation Program Approved Products List where applicable, and
        can use the PIMM presented in Section 9 to measure progress toward the goal of
        interoperability. [FIPS 201 Evaluation Program]
Section 6.2
        Recommendation: Once all appropriate authentication mechanisms are satisfied,
        all access control decisions are made by comparing the 14 decimal digit FASC-N
        Identifier, and optionally the values of additional FASC-N fields, against the ACL
        entries.
        Recommendation: As agencies develop risk-based implementation plans, they
        will create and evolve plans for PIV Card issuance and application integration.
        They might consider which of the eight qualities are most relevant to agency goals
        and priorities, and derive further project objectives, metrics, and milestones from
        those qualities. They should also consider the relation of HSPD-12 to FISMA




                                                                                          Page 51
Special Publication 800-116                A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



        requirements, and examine the potential for cost tradeoffs where PIV can replace
        more expensive authentication methods.
Section 6.3
        Recommendation: Operational metrics should be designed to measure actual
        benefits over the operational lifetime of the PIV System. They may be derived by
        formulating each of the expected benefits above as a service quality metric, e.g.,
        for “integrated system”, service quality could be defined as the fraction of PACS
        registrations that are performed automatically by provisioning from the PIV
        issuance system.
Section 6.4
        Recommendation: Maximum benefit will be obtained from the PIV System when
        it is adequately supported by infrastructure. Infrastructure upgrades may be
        justified, especially to improve communication among PACS system elements
        (e.g., support two way communication).
Section 7.1
        Recommendation: NIST strongly recommends that every PIV Card contain an
        asymmetric CAK and corresponding certificate, and that PACS use an asymmetric
        challenge/response CAK protocol.
        Recommendation: PACS should always verify the digital signature on the biometric
        template data object, and do path validation, before performing a match. Otherwise, the
        result of the match should not be trusted.
        Recommendation: Biometric readers, especially those used at access points to Limited
        and Exclusion areas, should have a proven capability to accept live fingers and reject
        artificial fingers. Biometric readers, especially unattended readers in an Unrestricted
        area, should be physically hardened to protect against direct electrical compromise.
Section 7.3
        Recommendation: Authentication assurance will be increased if a PACS uses relevant
        information from previous access control decisions (“context”) when making a new
        access control decision. For example, if a cardholder attempts to pass from a Controlled
        to a Limited area, the PACS could require that the cardholder was recently allowed
        access to the Controlled area. Historically, rigorous implementation of this concept
        required person-traps and exit tracking, but partial implementations have significant
        value, and could be strengthened by new technology and systems integration.
Section 7.4
        Recommendation: When a PIV Card is terminated, the PCI must revoke all valid
        authentication certificates for the PIV Card. The authentication certificates include the
        PIV Authentication Key certificate and the Card Authentication Key certificate (if
        present).
        Recommendation: The CHUID may be collected at registration, but it should be treated
        as if it were a password for purposes of retention, i.e., hashed, the hash stored, and the
        CHUID deleted. A stored CHUID presents risks similar to a stored password; it can be
        copied and used to gain access. Data elements may be extracted from the CHUID and
        retained (e.g., the FASC-N, DUNS Number, and GUID), and a retained hash is sufficient
        to enable verification. NIST strongly recommends against the storage of complete
        CHUIDs in relying systems.


                                                                                           Page 52
Special Publication 800-116                 A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in PACS



        Recommendation: PKI and asymmetric CAK authentication mechanisms should
        be implemented by a PACS reader capable of full certificate path validation, either
        on-line or using a caching status proxy. Agencies should consider using on-line
        status checks as a means to reduce the latency of PIV Card status when a PIV Card
        is used for access to Exclusion areas. If a caching status proxy is used, the
        certificates should be captured when the PIV Card is registered to the PACS.


Section 7.5
        Recommendation: On-line credential validation should be implemented for all of the
        FIPS 201 authentication mechanisms whenever possible. It is especially important when
        the one-factor, non-biometric mechanisms (CHUID, CAK) are used, because they could
        be exploited by simple possession of a misappropriated PIV Card. Caching techniques
        can be used to implement credential validation when on-line, on-demand credential
        validation is not possible. It is also recommended that the cached data be protected
        against tampering.
        Recommendation: Path validation should be performed on all signed data objects
        required by the authentication mechanism in use. Path validation should employ on-line
        credential validation where possible, or cached certificate status where on-line certificate
        validation is not possible.
Section 8.6
        Recommendation: Because having on-card role and permission information
        would raise difficult challenges concerning update and revocation, PACS
        permissions should generally be stored in a PACS facilities-based component, such
        as a panel or controller database.
Section 10.1
        Recommendation: Agencies should collaborate to standardize an enhancement or
        replacement of the FASC-N that accomplishes both credential identification and
        object binding, and supports an extensible framework for subject identification.
Section 10.2
        Recommendation: SBMOC should be pursued as a standard FIPS 201
        authentication mechanism, especially for PACS. Assuming it is judged to be at
        least as trustworthy as PIN entry, SBMOC should be allowed to substitute for PIN
        to activate a PIV Card.

Appendix B—PIV Uniqueness

All access control decisions are made by comparing a FASC-N Identifier, which includes Agency
Code, System Code, and Credential Number, against the ACL entries. Optionally, the values of
additional FASC-N fields may also be compared. An ACL pattern may match the entire FASC-
N, just the Agency Code, or the Agency Code and System Code (e.g., all PIV Cards issued to one
agency, or to one site in one agency) without introducing dangerous collisions or ambiguities
across agencies. In other words, an individual’s FASC-N Identifier is unique among all
cardholders when the complete three element subset of the FASC-N is used for comparison.
There will be no collisions since all the cardholders have been assigned unique numbers.
This restricts the access control comparison to one of three cases:
    1. the Agency Code alone (i.e., all PIV Cards with the same Agency Code are accepted);
    2. the Agency Code and System Code only (i.e., all PIV Card with the same Agency Code
       and System Code are accepted); or
    3. the Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number (i.e., a uniquely identified PIV
       Card).
Any of these cases may also include comparison of additional FASC-N values such as the
Credential Series, Individual Credential Issue, Organizational Identifier, or Person Identifier.
The FASC-N data fields are defined as fixed length values of Binary Coded Decimal digits. The
complete subset of three data fields is 14 decimal digits in length, as stored on the PIV Card.
Other representations of the FASC-N Identifier, for example a binary representation, may be used
off-card, provided that they are isomorphic with respect to pattern matching. The following
examples demonstrate the possible uses of FASC-N in a PIV-enabled PACS application.

Appendix C—Possible PIV Authentication Mechanisms in PACS

The following list provides a complete list of possible PIV authentication mechanism
combinations that are available for application to Federal facilities. The table entry contains PIV
authentication mechanisms used to cross from Unrestricted to Controlled to Limited to Exclusion.
The following acronyms are used in the table:
CV – CHUID + VIS
CAK – Card Authentication Key
BIO – Biometric
BIO-A – Biometric in Attendance
PKI – PIV Authentication Key
CPB – CAK + BIO combined or CAK + BIO-A combined
The table below provides all possible applications of PIV authentication mechanisms, progressing
from Unrestricted to Exclusion areas. Note that the table includes individual PIV authentication
mechanisms except for the combination of CV and CPB. Other PIV authentication mechanisms
combinations can also be derived. The arrows in the above table represent the possibility of
crossing multiple levels at an Access Point. For example, the arrow on Line 6 shows that CPB
may be used to access Limited or Exclusion areas.

The table below provides the effect of combination of PIV authentication mechanisms. The entry
in the box corresponds to the result achieved after combination of two mechanisms represented in
the row and column. For example, when PKI is combined with BIO the result is the same as
CPB. The table below can be summarized as follows:

      +   When CAK is combined with CV, the result is equivalent to CAK.

      +   When BIO is combined with CV, the result is equivalent to BIO-A.

      +   When PKI or CAK is combined with BIO or BIO-A, the result is equivalent to CPB.

      +   When PKI is combined with CV or CAK, the result is equivalent to PKI.

      +   When CPB is combined with any other PIV authentication mechanism, the result is
          equivalent to CPB.
