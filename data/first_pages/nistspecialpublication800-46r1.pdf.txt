Executive Summary

Many organizations’ employees and contractors use enterprise telework technologies to perform work
from external locations. Most teleworkers use remote access technologies to interface with an
organization’s non-public computing resources. The nature of telework and remote access technologies—
permitting access to protected resources from external networks and often external hosts as well—
generally places them at higher risk than similar technologies only accessed from inside the organization,
as well as increasing the risk to the internal resources made available to teleworkers through remote
access.

All the components of telework and remote access solutions, including client devices, remote access
servers, and internal resources accessed through remote access, should be secured against expected
threats, as identified through threat models. Major security concerns include the lack of physical security
controls, the use of unsecured networks, the connection of infected devices to internal networks, and the
availability of internal resources to external hosts. This publication provides information on security
considerations for several types of remote access solutions, and it makes recommendations for securing a
variety of telework and remote access technologies. It also gives advice on creating telework security
policies.

To improve the security of their telework and remote access technologies, organizations should
implement the following recommendations:

Plan telework security policies and controls based on the assumption that external environments
contain hostile threats.

An organization should assume that external facilities, networks, and devices contain hostile threats that
will attempt to gain access to the organization’s data and resources. Organizations should assume that
telework client devices, which are used in a variety of external locations and are particularly prone to loss
or theft, will be acquired by malicious parties who will attempt to recover sensitive data from them.
Options for mitigating this type of threat include encrypting the device’s storage and not storing sensitive
data on client devices. Organizations should also assume that communications on external networks,
which are outside the organization’s control, are susceptible to eavesdropping, interception, and
modification. This type of threat can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by using encryption technologies to
protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications, as well as authenticating each of the
endpoints to each other to verify their identities. Another important assumption is that telework client
devices will become infected with malware; possible controls for this include using anti-malware
technologies, using network access control solutions that verify the client’s security posture before
granting access, and using a separate network at the organization’s facilities for telework client devices
brought in for internal use.

Develop a telework security policy that defines telework and remote access requirements.

A telework security policy should define which forms of remote access the organization permits, which
types of telework devices are permitted to use each form of remote access, and the type of access each
type of teleworker is granted. It should also cover how the organization's remote access servers are
administered and how policies in those servers are updated.

As part of creating a telework security policy, an organization should make its own risk-based decisions
about what levels of remote access should be permitted from which types of telework client devices. For
example, an organization may choose to have tiered levels of remote access, such as allowing
organization-owned personal computers (PC) to access many resources, teleworker-owned PCs to access


                                                    ES-1
                                                             GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



a limited set of resources, and other PCs and types of devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants
[PDA]) to access only one or two lower-risk resources, such as Web-based email. Having tiered levels of
remote access allows an organization to limit the risk it incurs by permitting the most-controlled devices
to have the most access and the least-controlled devices to have minimal access.

There are many factors that organizations should consider when setting policy regarding levels of remote
access to grant; examples include the sensitivity of the telework, the level of confidence in the telework
client device’s security posture, the cost associated with telework devices, the locations from which
telework is performed, and compliance with mandates and other policies. For telework situations that an
organization determines are particularly high-risk, an organization may choose to specify additional
security requirements. For example, high-risk telework might be permitted only from organization-issued
and secured telework client devices that employ multi-factor authentication and storage encryption.
Organizations may also choose to reduce risk by prohibiting telework and remote access involving
particular types of information, such as highly sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). 1

Ensure that remote access servers are secured effectively and are configured to enforce telework
security policies.

Remote access servers provide a way for external hosts to gain access to internal resources, so their
security is particularly important. In addition to permitting unauthorized access to resources, a
compromised server could be used to eavesdrop on remote access communications and manipulate them,
as well as to provide a “jumping off” point for attacking other hosts within the organization. It is
particularly important for organizations to ensure that remote access servers are kept fully patched and
that they can only be managed from trusted hosts by authorized administrators. Organizations should also
carefully consider the network placement of remote access servers; in most cases, a server should be
placed at an organization’s network perimeter so that it acts as a single point of entry to the network and
enforces the telework security policy before any remote access traffic is permitted into the organization’s
internal networks.

Secure telework client devices against common threats and maintain their security regularly.

There are many threats to telework client devices, including malware and device loss or theft. Generally,
telework client devices should include all the local security controls used in the organization’s secure
configuration baseline for its non-telework client devices. 2 Examples are applying operating system and
application updates promptly, disabling unneeded services, and using antimalware software and a
personal firewall. However, because telework devices are generally at greater risk in external
environments than in enterprise environments, additional security controls are recommended, such as
encrypting sensitive data stored on the devices, and existing security controls may need to be adjusted.
For example, if a personal firewall on a telework client device has a single policy for all environments,
then it is likely to be too restrictive in some situations and not restrictive enough in others. Whenever
possible, organizations should use personal firewalls capable of supporting multiple policies for their
telework client devices and configure the firewalls properly for the enterprise environment and an
external environment, at a minimum.

Organizations should ensure that all types of telework client devices are secured, including PCs, cell
phones, and PDAs. For PCs, this includes physical security (for example, using cable locks to deter theft).
For devices other than PCs, security capabilities and the appropriate security actions vary widely by

2.      Overview of Enterprise Telework and Remote Access Security

Many people telework (also known as telecommuting), which is the ability for an organization’s
employees and contractors to perform work from locations other than the organization’s facilities.
Teleworkers use various client devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, cell phones, and personal
digital assistants (PDA), to read and send email, access Web sites, review and edit documents, and
perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access, which is the ability for an organization’s
users to access its non-public computing resources from external locations other than the organization’s
facilities.

This section of the publication provides an overview of security concerns for enterprise telework and
remote access technologies. It explains the primary vulnerabilities and threats specific to telework and
remote access security, and recommends mitigation strategies for those threats. It also discusses the most
commonly used types of remote access methods, examines their major vulnerabilities, and recommends
security controls to mitigate threats.

2.1     Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Security Controls

Telework and remote access solutions typically need to support several security objectives. These can be
accomplished through a combination of security features built into the remote access solutions and
additional security controls applied to the telework client devices and other components of the remote
access solution. The most common security objectives for telework and remote access technologies are as
follows:

 Confidentiality—ensure that remote access communications and stored user data cannot be read by
  unauthorized parties
 Integrity—detect any intentional or unintentional changes to remote access communications that
  occur in transit
 Availability—ensure that users can access resources through remote access whenever needed.
To achieve these objectives, all of the components of telework and remote access solutions, including
client devices, remote access servers, and internal servers accessed through remote access, should be
secured against a variety of threats. General security recommendations for any IT technology are
provided in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems. 3 Specific recommendations for securing telework and remote access technologies
are presented in this publication and are intended to supplement the controls specified in SP 800-53.

Telework and remote access technologies often need additional protection because their nature generally
places them at higher exposure to external threats than technologies only accessed from inside the
organization. Before designing and deploying telework and remote access solutions, organizations should
develop system threat models for the remote access servers and the resources that are accessed through
remote access. Threat modeling involves identifying resources of interest and the feasible threats,
vulnerabilities, and security controls related to these resources, then quantifying the likelihood of
successful attacks and their impacts, and finally analyzing this information to determine where security
controls need to be improved or added. Threat modeling helps organizations to identify security
requirements and to design the remote access solution to incorporate the controls needed to meet the

3
      These recommendations are linked to three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of
      a security breach involving a particular system, as defined in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199,
      Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.

security requirements. Major security concerns for these technologies that would be included in most
telework threat models are as follows:

 Lack of Physical Security Controls. Telework client devices are used in a variety of locations
  outside the organization’s control, such as employees’ homes, coffee shops, hotels, and conferences.
  The mobile nature of these devices makes them likely to be lost or stolen, which places the data on
  the devices at increased risk of compromise. When planning telework security policies and controls,
  organizations should assume that client devices will be acquired by malicious parties who will
  attempt to recover sensitive data from the devices. The primary mitigation strategies are either to
  encrypt the client device’s storage so that sensitive data cannot be recovered from it by unauthorized
  parties, or to not store sensitive data on client devices. Even if a client device is always in the
  possession of its owner, there are other physical security risks, such as an attacker looking over a
  teleworker’s shoulder at a coffee shop and viewing sensitive data on the client device’s screen.
 Unsecured Networks. Because nearly all remote access occurs over the Internet, organizations
  normally have no control over the security of the external networks used by telework clients.
  Communications systems used for remote access include telephone and Digital Subscriber Line
  (DSL) modems, broadband networks such as cable, and wireless mechanisms such as IEEE 802.11,
  WiMAX, and cellular networks. 4 These communications systems are susceptible to eavesdropping,
  which places sensitive information transmitted during remote access at risk of compromise. Man-in-
  the-middle (MITM) attacks may also be performed to intercept and modify communications.
  Organizations should plan their remote access security on the assumption that the networks between
  the telework client device and the organization, including teleworkers’ home networks, cannot be
  trusted. Risk from use of unsecured networks can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by using
  encryption technologies to protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications, as well as
  using mutual authentication mechanisms to verify the identities of both endpoints.
 Infected Devices on Internal Networks. Telework client devices, particularly laptops, are often used
  on external networks and then brought into the organization and attached directly to the
  organization’s internal networks. Also, an attacker with physical access to a client device may install
  malware on the device to gather data from it and from networks and systems that it connects to. If a
  client device is infected with malware, this malware may spread throughout the organization once the
  client device is connected to the internal network. Organizations should assume that client devices
  will become infected and plan their security controls accordingly. In addition to using appropriate
  anti-malware technologies from the organization’s secure configuration baseline, such as antimalware
  software on client devices, organizations should consider the use of network access control (NAC)
  solutions that verify the security posture of a client device before allowing it to use an internal
  network. Organizations should also consider using a separate network for telework client devices,
  instead of permitting them to directly connect to the internal network.
 External Access to Internal Resources. Remote access provides external hosts with access to
  internal resources, such as servers. If these internal resources were not previously accessible from
  external networks, making them available via remote access will expose them to new threats,
  particularly from untrusted client devices and networks, and significantly increase the likelihood that
  they will be compromised. Each form of remote access that can be used to access an internal resource
  increases the risk of that resource being compromised. Organizations should carefully consider the
  balance between the benefits of providing remote access to additional resources and the potential

4
    Because of this assumption of lack of security of the network connection, this publication does not address leased lines, dial-
    up and DSL modems, or other communications mechanisms that can be secured at the data link layer. If an organization
    uses a data link mechanism that adds security, the type of security described in this document would be on top of that data
    link security, but would not interact with it.

      impact of a compromise of those resources. Organizations should ensure that any internal resources
      they choose to make available through remote access are hardened appropriately against external
      threats 5 and that access to the resources is limited to the minimum necessary through firewalling and
      other access control mechanisms.
The rest of this section describes remote access technologies and discusses security considerations for
each, focusing on the elements described above.

2.2     Remote Access Methods

Organizations have many options for providing remote access to their computing resources. For the
purposes of this publication, the remote access methods most commonly used for teleworkers have been
divided into four categories based on their high-level architectures: tunneling, portals, remote desktop
access, and direct application access. The remote access methods in all four categories have some features
in common:

 They are all dependent on the physical security of the client devices.
 They can use multiple types of server and user authentication mechanisms. This flexibility allows
  some remote access methods to work with an organization’s existing authentication mechanisms,
  such as passwords or certificates. Some remote access methods have standardized authentication
  mechanisms, while others use implementation-specific mechanisms.
 They can use cryptography to protect the data flowing between the telework client device and the
  organization from being viewed by others. This cryptographic protection is inherent in VPNs and
  cryptographic tunneling in general, and it is an option in most remote desktop access and direct
  application access systems.
 They can allow teleworkers to store data on their client devices. For example, most tunnel, portal, and
  remote desktop access systems offer features for copying files from computers inside the organization
  to the teleworker's client device. This allows the teleworker to work with the data locally, such as in a
  locally installed word processor. Some applications that can be reached through direct application
  access also allow transmitting files to the teleworker. Data may also be stored on client devices
  inadvertently, such as through operating system page files or Web browser caches. It is important that
  all data sent to the teleworker through remote access be covered by the organization's data
  distribution and data retention policies.
Sections 3 and 4 provide more details on remote access authentication, communications encryption, and
client data security.

Additional information on the four categories of remote access methods is provided below. When
planning a remote access solution, organizations should carefully consider the security implications of the
remote access methods in each category, in addition to how well each method may meet operational
requirements. The figures in this section show some of the operational and security properties of the four
categories of remote access methods. In the figures, the flared pipe is the cryptographically-protected
communications that originate with the teleworker’s device. The arrow and the application software labels
indicate the flow of communications between the application client and server software. The dotted
vertical line shows the perimeter of the organization’s network; everything to the left of the dotted line
represents the Internet, while to the right of the dotted line is the internal network.

2.2.1   Tunneling

Many remote access methods offer a secure communications tunnel through which information can be
transmitted between networks, including public networks such as the Internet. Tunnels are typically
established through virtual private network (VPN) technologies. Once a VPN tunnel has been established
between a teleworker’s client device and the organization’s VPN gateway, the teleworker can access
many of the organization’s computing resources through the tunnel. To use a VPN, users must either have
the appropriate VPN software on their client devices or be on a network that has a VPN gateway system
on it. In Figure 2-1, a VPN client is installed on each of the client devices, and there is a single VPN
gateway that runs the VPN server software. The pipe represents a secure remote access connection
(tunnel) between a client device and the VPN gateway. Through this tunnel, application client software
(e.g., email client, word processor, web browser, database client) installed on the client device
communicates with application server software residing on servers within the organization. 6 The VPN
gateway can take care of user authentication, access control (at the host, service, and application levels),
and other security functions for teleworkers.




                                          Figure 2-1. Tunneling Architecture

Tunnels use cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted information
between the client device and the VPN gateway. Tunnels can also authenticate users, provide access
control (such as restricting which protocols may be transmitted or which internal hosts may be reached
through remote access), and perform other security functions. However, although remote access methods
based on tunneling protect the communications between the client device and the VPN gateway, they do
not provide any protection for the communications between the VPN gateway and internal resources.
Also, in tunneling solutions, the application client software and data at rest resides on the client device, so
they are not protected by the tunneling solution and should be protected by other means.

The types of VPNs most commonly used for teleworkers are Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunnels. 7 Tunneling may also be achieved by using Secure Shell (SSH),
although this is less commonly used and is often considered more difficult to configure and maintain than
IPsec or SSL tunnel VPNs. All three forms of tunneling mentioned in this section can protect many


6
    This architecture, with the VPN gateway and the application servers being on separate hosts, is the most commonly used
    tunneling solution for remote access. However, the VPN gateway and the application servers could be on a single host.
7
    Another, more commonly used form of SSL VPNs uses a portal architecture. Section 2.2.2 discusses SSL portal VPNs. An
    SSL tunnel VPN generally uses a plug-in installed within a Web browser that supports tunneling within an SSL connection.


                                                            2-4
                                                             GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



protocols at once. More information on IPsec VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs are available from NIST SP
800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs and NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, respectively. 8

Many communication encryption protocols can be expanded into tunneling protocols in the same way that
SSL is used for SSL VPNs. For example, some systems use the SSH protocol to create tunnels, although
the method for doing so is not yet standardized. In general, standardized tunneling protocols can be
configured to have the same cryptographic strength and to use the same (or functionally similar)
mechanism for authenticating the two parties to each other. Different tunneling systems can tunnel
various protocols; for example, IPsec has standardized extensions that allow it to tunnel Layer 2 protocols
such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). In general, almost
any communication encryption protocol can be made to tunnel almost any layer.

The VPN gateway can control access to the parts of the network and the types of access that the
teleworker gets after authentication. For example, a VPN might allow a user to only have access to one
subnet, or to only run particular applications on certain servers on the protected network. In this way,
even though the cryptographic tunnel ends at the VPN gateway, the gateway can add additional routing to
the teleworker's traffic to only allow access to some parts of the internal network.

VPNs are usually established and managed by VPN gateway devices owned and managed by the
organization being protected. In some cases, organizations outsource their VPNs to trusted third parties.
Such a third party might simply manage the VPN gateway that is owned by the organization, but other
third parties offer services where they own and control the VPN gateway. In the latter case, the
organization should evaluate the security of the proposed solution and ensure it will support the
organization’s security policy.

2.2.2    Application Portals

Another category of remote access solutions involves portals. A portal is a server that offers access to one
or more applications through a single centralized interface. A teleworker uses a portal client on a telework
client device to access the portal. Most portals are web-based—for them, the portal client is a regular web
browser. Figure 2-2 shows the basic portal solution architecture. The application client software is
installed on the portal server, and it communicates with application server software on servers within the
organization. The portal server communicates securely with the portal client as needed; the exact nature
of this depends on the type of portal solution in use, as discussed below.




                                               Figure 2-2. Portal Architecture

                                                               2-5
                                                     GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



In terms of security, portals have most of the same characteristics as tunnels: portals protect information
between client devices and the portal, and they can provide authentication, access control, and other
security services. However, there is an important difference between tunnels and portals—the location of
the application client software and associated data. In a tunnel, the software and data are on the client
device; in a portal, they are on the portal server. A portal server transfers data to the client device as
rendered desktop screen images or web pages, but data is typically stored on the client device much more
temporarily than data for a tunneled solution is. (However, portals can be configured to allow clients to
download content from the portal and store it on the client device or other locations outside the secure
remote access environment.) Having the application client software centralized gives an organization
more control over how the software and data is secured as opposed to more distributed remote access
solutions. Portals limit the access a teleworker has to particular application clients running on the portal
itself. Those applications further limit the access the teleworker has to the servers inside the network.

There are a few types of portal solutions commonly used for remote access. A web-based portal provides
a user with access to multiple web-based applications from a single portal web site. An SSL portal VPN is
a common form of web-based portal. Another type of portal solution is terminal server access, which
gives each teleworker access to a separate standardized virtual desktop. The terminal server simulates the
look and feel of a desktop operating system and provides access to applications. Terminal server access
requires the teleworker either to install a special terminal server client application on the client device or
to use a Web-based interface, often with a browser plug-in or other additional software provided by the
organization. Another similar remote access method, called virtual desktop access, involves the user
connecting to a system that contains virtual images of standardized, non-simulated operating systems and
desktops. When the teleworker is finished with a remote access session, the virtual image is discarded so
that the next user will have a clean virtual desktop.

The mechanism for providing an interface to the teleworker varies among portals. For example, terminal
server access and virtual desktop access present a standardized virtual desktop to the teleworker, while
SSL portal VPNs present each application through a web page. The nature of this interface is important
because it relates to the storage, temporary or permanent, of data. For many portals, the user interface is
virtual, and after the user session is over, that instance of the interface is essentially destroyed and a clean
version used for the next session. Some portals, such as SSL portal VPNs, can be configured to establish a
secure virtual machine on the client device, restrict all remote access data to reside within that virtual
machine, and then securely destroy the virtual machine instance and all the data that existed within it
when the session ends. This helps to ensure that sensitive information does not inadvertently become
stored on a telework client device, where it could possibly be recovered by a future compromise.

2.2.3   Remote Desktop Access

A remote desktop access solution gives a teleworker the ability to remotely control a particular desktop
computer at the organization, most often the user’s own computer at the organization’s office, from a
telework client device. The teleworker has keyboard and mouse control over the remote computer and
sees that computer’s screen on the local telework client device’s screen. Remote desktop access allows
the user to access all of the applications, data, and other resources that are normally available from their
computer in the office. Figure 2-3 shows the basic remote desktop access architecture. A remote desktop
access client program or web browser plug-in is installed on each telework client device, and it connects
directly with the teleworker’s corresponding internal workstation on the organization’s internal network.




                                                      2-6
                                                            GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY




                                   Figure 2-3. Remote Desktop Access Architecture

There are two major styles of remote desktop access: direct between the telework client and the internal
workstation, and indirect through a trusted intermediate system. However, direct access is often not
possible because it is prevented by many firewalls. For example, if the internal workstation is behind a
firewall performing network address translation (NAT), the telework client device cannot initiate contact
with the internal workstation unless either the NAT allows such contact 9 or the internal workstation
initiates communications with the external telework client device (e.g., periodically checking with the
client device to see if it wants to connect).

Indirect remote desktop access is performed through an intermediate server. This server is sometimes part
of the organization's firewall, but is more often run by a trusted commercial or free third-party service
outside the organization's network perimeter. Usually there are separate connections between the telework
client device and the service provider, and between the service provider and the internal workstation, with
the intermediate server handling the unencrypted communications between the separate connections. The
security of this intermediate server is very important, because it is responsible for properly authenticating
teleworkers and preventing unencrypted traffic from being accessed by unauthorized parties. Also, if the
organization’s security policy requires particular kinds of authentication (such as the two-factor
authentication required by federal agencies), the intermediate server should support this authentication in
both directions. Before implementing an indirect remote desktop access solution, an organization should
evaluate the security provided by the service provider, especially possible threats involving the
intermediate server and the potential impact of those threats. The organization can then identify
compensating controls to mitigate the threats, such as applying a second level of communications
encryption at the application layer, and determine under what circumstances the intermediate system may
be used, such as for low-risk activities.

The remote desktop access software protects the confidentiality and integrity of the remote access
communications and also authenticates the user to ensure that no one else connects to the internal
workstation. However, because this involves end-to-end encryption of the communications across the
organization’s perimeter, the contents of the communication are hidden from the network security
controls at the perimeter, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. For many organizations, the
increased risk caused by this is not worth the benefits, and direct connections from external client devices
to internal workstations are prohibited.



9
    This can be accomplished using a “pinhole” scheme that requires particular ports to be allocated to each workstation.


                                                             2-7
                                                    GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



Another serious security issue with remote desktop access software is that it is decentralized; instead of
the organization having to secure a single VPN gateway server or portal server, the organization instead
has to secure each internal workstation that may be accessed through remote desktop access. Because
these internal workstations can be accessed from the Internet, either directly or indirectly, they generally
need to be secured nearly as rigorously as full-fledged remote access servers, yet such workstations were
usually not designed with that degree of security in mind. Applying compensating controls for each
workstation to raise its security to an acceptable level often involves a significant amount of time and
resources, as well as acquisition of additional security controls. Also, authentication solutions such as
two-factor authentication capabilities may need to be deployed to each internal workstation using remote
desktop access.

Generally, remote desktop access solutions should only be used for exceptional cases after a careful
analysis of the security risks. The other types of remote access solutions described in this section offer
superior security capabilities.

2.2.4   Direct Application Access

Remote access can be accomplished without using remote access software. A teleworker can access an
individual application directly, with the application providing its own security (communications
encryption, user authentication, etc.) Figure 2-4 shows the high-level architecture for direct application
access. The application client software installed on the telework client device initiates a connection with a
server, which is typically located at the organization’s perimeter (e.g., in a demilitarized zone [DMZ]).




                             Figure 2-4. Direct Application Access Architecture

One of the most common examples of direct application access is web-based access to email, also known
as webmail. The teleworker runs a web browser and connects to a web server that provides email access.
The web server runs HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) to protect the communications, and the webmail
application on the server authenticates the teleworker before granting access to the teleworker’s email.
For cases such as webmail that use a ubiquitous application client (e.g., a web browser), direct application
access provides a highly flexible remote access solution that can be used from nearly any client device.

For the same reasons discussed in Section 2.2.3, the direct application access architecture is generally
only acceptable if the servers being accessed by the teleworkers are located on the organization’s network
perimeter, and not internal networks. Servers on the perimeter are directly accessible from the Internet, so
they should be well-secured to reduce the likelihood of compromise. Many organizations choose to



                                                     2-8
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



provide direct application access to only a few lower-risk applications that are widely used, such as email,
and use tunnel or portal methods to provide access to other applications, particularly those that would be
at too much risk if they were directly accessible from the Internet.

2.3    Summary of Key Recommendations

The following list presents some of the key recommendations from this section of the document.

 To support confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all of the components of telework and remote
  access solutions, including client devices, remote access servers, and internal servers accessed
  through remote access, should be secured against a variety of threats. (Section 2.1)
 Before designing and deploying telework and remote access solutions, organizations should develop
  system threat models for the remote access servers and the resources that are accessed through remote
  access. (Section 2.1)
 When planning telework security policies and controls, organizations should assume that client
  devices will be acquired by malicious parties who will attempt to recover sensitive data from the
  devices. (Section 2.1)
 Organizations should plan their remote access security on the assumption that the networks between
  the telework client device and the organization, including teleworkers’ home networks, cannot be
  trusted. (Section 2.1)
 Organizations should assume that client devices will become infected with malware and plan their
  security controls accordingly. (Section 2.1)
 Organizations should carefully consider the balance between the benefits of providing remote access
  to additional resources and the potential impact of a compromise of those resources. Organizations
  should ensure that any internal resources they choose to make available through remote access are
  hardened appropriately against external threats and that access to the resources is limited to the
  minimum necessary through firewalling and other access control mechanisms. (Section 2.1)
 When planning a remote access solution, organizations should carefully consider the security
  implications of the remote access methods in each of the four categories described in Section 2.2, in
  addition to how well each method may meet operational requirements. (Section 2.2)

3.    Remote Access Solution Security

This section presents recommendations for securing remote access solutions. It focuses on remote access
server security and server placement. It also discusses authentication, authorization, and access control.
Recommendations for securing remote access client software are presented in this section, while
recommendations for telework client device security are presented in Section 4.

3.1   Remote Access Server Security

Because remote access servers, such as VPN gateways and portal servers, provide ways for external hosts
such as telework devices to gain access to internal resources, their security is particularly important. In
addition to permitting unauthorized access to resources, a compromised server could be used to eavesdrop
on remote access communications and manipulate them, as well as a “jumping off” point for attacking
other hosts within the organization. Recommendations for general server security are available from NIST
SP 800-123, Guide to General Server Security. Remote access servers should be kept fully patched,
operated using an organization-defined security configuration baseline, and only managed from trusted
hosts by authorized administrators.

VPN gateways and portals can run many services and applications, such as firewalls, antimalware
software, and intrusion detection software. Organizations should carefully consider the security of any
solutions that involve running a remote access server on the same host as other services and applications.
Such solutions may offer benefits, such as equipment cost savings, but a compromise of any one of the
services or applications could permit an attacker to compromise the entire remote access server. Placing
the remote access server on a separate, dedicated host reduces the likelihood of a remote access server
compromise and limits its potential impact. Using a separate host may also be advisable if the remote
access server is likely to place other services and applications at significantly increased risk. An
organization should also consider using multiple remote access solutions if its remote access users have
vastly different security needs, such as one group accessing typical low-risk resources and another group
accessing mission-critical confidential data.

The security of stored data is another important consideration for remote access server security. For portal
servers that may temporarily store sensitive user data, wiping such data from the server as soon as it is no
longer needed can reduce the potential impact of a compromise of the server. The need to wipe sensitive
data from remote access servers should be determined based on a risk assessment.

3.2   Remote Access Server Placement

Major factors organizations should consider when determining where to place a remote access server
include the following:

 Device Performance. Remote access services can be computationally intensive, primarily because of
  encryption and decryption. Providing remote access services from a device that also provides other
  services may put too high of a load on the server during peak usage, causing service disruptions. The
  performance impact caused by encryption and key exchange can be reduced by performing them on
  hardware-based cryptographic accelerator chips. These chips can be located on computer
  motherboards or add-on cards.
 Traffic Examination. Because the contents of encrypted remote access communications cannot be
  examined by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other network security devices, it is
  generally recommended that the remote access architecture be designed so that an unencrypted form




                                                    3-1
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



    of the communications can be examined by the appropriate network and/or host-based security
    controls.
 Traffic Not Protected by the Remote Access Solution. Organizations should carefully consider the
  threats against network traffic that is not protected by the remote access solution, such as traffic
  passed between a remote access server and internal resources.
 NAT. The use of NAT can cause operational problems for some remote access solutions. For
  example, any remote access system that requires the teleworker to connect directly to a host inside the
  network, such as a remote desktop system or a VPN with its public endpoint inside the network,
  cannot work with a NAT without special configuration that may or may not work. NATs also prevent
  the use of applications that require addresses not to change (e.g., embed addresses in the application
  content). Protocols and mechanisms that break through NATs to solve particular access problems
  often introduce their own security problems, such as possibly allowing access to different hosts inside
  the NAT at different times. Some newer NAT technologies, particularly those involving IPv6, are not
  yet well understood and their security properties not yet fully analyzed.
Organizations should carefully consider the placement of their remote access servers. Some remote access
servers, such as VPN gateways, generally act as intermediaries between telework devices and the
organization’s internal computing resources. Other hosts providing remote access services, such as direct
application access and remote desktop access solutions, are true endpoints for remote access
communications. Both categories of remote access servers are discussed below.

Remote access servers are usually placed at an organization's network perimeter. Such placement is
common because the organizational security policies most often apply to the entire network of an
organization. Even if a particular security policy applies to one sub-network of the organization, most
remote access servers can restrict access to sub-networks and therefore can be placed at the organization's
perimeter. In some network layouts, it is better to put a remote access server inside the perimeter, at the
boundary of a sub-network. The rest of this section describes when such a network layout might be
appropriate.

3.2.1   Intermediary Remote Access Servers

Intermediate remote access servers connect external hosts to internal resources, so they should usually be
placed at the network perimeter. The server acts as a single point of entry to the network from the
perimeter and enforces the telework security policy. If remote access is needed to a particular sub-
network within the organization, there are generally two options: place the remote access server at the
edge of the sub-network—where the sub-network joins the full network—or place it at the perimeter of
the full network and use additional mechanisms to restrict the teleworkers to only be able to access the
specified sub-network. The value of placing the remote access server at the network perimeter versus the
sub-network perimeter differs for the four types of remote access methods:

 Tunneling servers usually give administrators sufficient control over the internal resources to which a
  teleworker has access, such that there is little advantage to setting up a tunneling server at the edge of
  a sub-network, as opposed to the network perimeter.
 Portal servers run the application client software on the servers themselves. Placing them at the
  network perimeter has a similar effect as placing them at the edge of a sub-network because the
  remote access user is only running applications on the portal server, not on servers inside the network.
 Remote desktop access does not involve remote access servers, so there is no issue with the
  placement of the remote access server.

                                                    GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



 Direct application access servers run the application server software on the servers themselves.
  Placing them at the network perimeter has a similar effect as placing them at the edge of a sub-
  network because the remote access user is only running applications on the direct application access
  server, not on servers inside the network.
Thus, the only types of remote access servers that may be appropriate to place at the sub-network
perimeter are portal servers and direct application access servers, but even in those two cases, it is often
better to run those on the organization’s perimeter so that the organization’s firewall can control access to
these servers for all workers, not just teleworkers. Further, to simplify management of the network and
the network’s security policy, running all remote access servers at the network perimeter is also advisable.
Therefore, organizations should place remote access servers at the network perimeter instead of the sub-
network perimeter unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise.

If a network has a firewall at the perimeter, remote access servers on that network should be directly
connected to, or in the same physical device as, the firewall so as to not circumvent the firewall’s security
policy. In the case that the two devices are the same, there is of course no question about the placement of
the remote access server. However, if the remote access server is a different device than the firewall, the
network planner must decide where to place the remote access server. If the firewall has a DMZ
associated with it, then that DMZ is likely the best location for the remote access server, otherwise the
server should be outside the firewall if the network topology allows for it. Both of these placements
provide logical separation between the remote access server and the internal networks. To reduce the
potential impact of a compromise of the remote access server, organizations should restrict
communications between the server and internal networks. The server should only be able to initiate
communications with the internal hosts and services specifically authorized for remote access usage, and
only the appropriate internal hosts (e.g., trusted hosts used to administer the remote access server) should
be able to initiate communications with the remote access server.

If the remote access server must be placed inside the firewall, the firewall’s security policy should be
adjusted to allow only the necessary traffic from teleworkers (and only teleworkers) to get to the remote
access server. This could involve limiting incoming traffic to only the IP addresses or address ranges used
by teleworkers’ home networks if those networks have stable addresses, for example. Setting up such a
precise policy for mobile telework client devices can be difficult to maintain and error-prone. Also,
because all remote access communications should be encrypted, as discussed in Section 4, network
security controls would be unable to monitor the contents of the communications. Therefore, this solution
should be avoided.

3.2.2    Endpoint Remote Access Servers

Endpoint remote access servers should be placed in the organization’s DMZ whenever possible. This
allows a perimeter firewall to limit access to the servers from both external and internal hosts, and avoids
the security issues discussed in Section 2.2.3 involved in allowing external traffic to pass directly into the
internal network. Implementations of remote desktop access solutions usually rely on internal
workstations to provide remote access services, so the use of such solutions is not generally
recommended.

3.3     Remote Access Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control

Most of the computing resources used through remote access are available only to an organization’s users,
and often only a subset of those users. To ensure that access is restricted properly, remote access servers
should authenticate each teleworker before granting any access to the organization’s resources, and then
use authorization technologies to ensure that only the necessary resources can be used. Authentication can



                                                     3-3

also be used to confirm the legitimacy of telework client devices and remote access servers. Access
control technologies are also needed to restrict access to network communications and applications. This
section provides additional details on remote access authentication, authorization, and access control.

3.3.1    Authentication

There are many ways to authenticate remote access users, such as with passwords 10 , digital certificates, or
hardware authentication tokens. If passwords are the only form of authentication for a remote access
solution, then generally the remote access solution’s authentication mechanism should be different from
the organization’s other authentication mechanisms, such as email or directory service passwords, unless
direct application access is being used. Having different passwords reduces the impact that a compromise
of remote access credentials would have on other information resources, and vice versa, and it is
particularly important if users are entering passwords into telework devices not controlled by the
organization. However, having different passwords for remote access and other systems is often not
enforceable 11 , and it should be assumed that some users will use the same passwords for both.
Organizations with higher security needs or with concerns about the security of passwords should
consider using authentication that does not rely solely on passwords, such as multifactor authentication.

Federal agencies are required to “allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of
the factors is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access”, according to OMB
Memorandum 07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable
Information. 12 Such two-factor authentication currently tends to be implemented through the use of a
cryptographic token and a password, because other authentication methods are often not available on
telework client devices. For example, most mobile devices do not have biometric capabilities, smart card
readers, or other additional authentication capabilities. This is particularly true for client devices not
issued by the organization.

Many organizations require teleworkers to reauthenticate periodically during long remote access sessions,
such as after each 8 hours of a session or after 30 minutes of idle time. This helps organizations confirm
that the person using remote access is authorized to do so. OMB M-07-16 requires Federal agencies to
“use a ‘time-out’ function for remote access and mobile devices requiring user re-authentication after
thirty minutes of inactivity”. 13 Remote access servers vary in their support for authentication methods and
session timeouts, so additional mechanisms may be needed to implement and enforce these policies.
Additional information on the types of user authentication methods appropriate for remote access can be
found in NIST SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline and OMB M-04-04, E-Authentication
Guidance for Federal Agencies. 14

Whenever feasible, organizations should implement mutual authentication, so that a remote access user
can verify the legitimacy of a remote access server before providing authentication credentials to it. An
example is verifying a digital certificate presented by the remote access server to ensure that the server is
controlled by the organization. User digital certificates can be used in many remote access systems,
although the systems vary in the way that they handle certificates. Most user digital certificates have the
private key associated with the certificate protected by a password. Some remote access methods, such as
10
     For more information and recommendations specific to passwords, see draft NIST SP 800-118, Guide to Enterprise
     Password Management (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).
11
     In some cases, it can be enforced by using a centralized password management system for both the remote access passwords
     and the other systems’ passwords. Many centralized password management systems can ensure that the same password is
     not used for two different systems.

IPsec and SSL VPN technologies, include mandatory server authentication during the setup of the secure
communications channel. Server authentication is most important for remote access methods where a user
is manually establishing the remote access connection, such as typing a URL into a Web browser. Section
3.4 presents additional information on this.

3.3.2    Authorization

After verifying the identity of a remote access user, organizations may choose to perform checks
involving the telework client device to determine which internal resources the user should be permitted to
access. These checks are sometimes called health, suitability, screening, or assessment checks. The most
common way of implementing this is having the remote access server perform “health checks” on the
teleworker's client device. These health checks require software on the user’s system that is controlled by
the remote access server to verify compliance with certain requirements from the organization’s secure
configuration baseline, such as the user’s antimalware software being up-to-date, the operating system
being fully patched, and the user’s system being owned and controlled by the organization.

Some remote access solutions can also determine if the device has been secured by the organization and
what type of device it is (e.g., desktop/laptop, PDA, video game system). Based on the results of these
checks, the organization can determine whether the device should be permitted to use remote access and
what level of access should be granted. If the user has acceptable authorization credentials but the client
device does not pass the health check, the user and device may be granted limited access to the internal
network, no network access at all, or access to a quarantine network so that the security deficiencies can
be fixed. This decision can also be based on the part of the network that the device is trying to access; an
organization might have more stringent policies for more sensitive data.

Authorization based on the type of device that is used and the device’s properties is referred to as network
access control (NAC). NAC is a security policy enforcement mechanism, not a true security protection
mechanism. The mechanisms used to accomplish NAC are still changing as products mature. Examples of
checks include verifying the presence of security patches, confirming that antimalware software is
enabled and up-to-date, and ensuring that a personal firewall is enabled and blocking incoming traffic.
However, many health checks are performed in ways that can be trivially circumvented by malware, so
organizations should not rely on NAC to stop determined attackers from gaining network access.
Organizations should use NAC whenever feasible to detect major security policy violations in telework
client devices and to prevent teleworkers from inadvertently using the wrong device for telework. Some
NAC solutions can also be used to control which internal resources each client device may access and
whether remediation actions have to be performed on a client device before it is permitted access.

For organizations that want to restrict or prohibit remote access by telework devices on external networks
other than teleworkers’ home networks, having organization-controlled security devices on home
networks may be particularly helpful. An example of such a policy is allowing access to a particular Web
server from anywhere, but disallowing access to a sensitive resource from all locations other than
authorized home networks. Some organizations choose to do this because external networks, such as
those at hotels, airport lounges, and coffee shops, may have more prevalent and serious threats than home
networks. Such policies can be implemented effectively if the organization has a security device deployed
on the home network, but otherwise are often impractical. Home network IP addresses often change,
unless a teleworker has a fixed IP address, 15 and teleworkers are usually unaware of their address
changing or what the new address is. Maintaining a list of permitted IP address may take significant
resources. Also, errors in the list and failures to update it promptly may prevent teleworkers from using

15
     Many Internet service providers (ISP) that provide home access do not allow users to have a fixed IP address, and most ISPs
     that do permit fixed IP addresses charge a monthly fee for this service.


                                                              3-5
                                                          GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



resources that they are authorized to access. An alternative strategy is to prompt users to report their
location when signing into a remote access system; because this information cannot be verified,
organizations should not rely on it for security purposes.

3.3.3    Access Control for Network Communications

A major component of controlling access to network communications and protecting their content is the
use of cryptography. At a minimum, any sensitive information passing over the Internet, wireless
networks, and other untrusted networks should have its confidentiality and integrity preserved through
use of cryptography. Federal agencies are required to use cryptographic algorithms that are NIST-
approved and contained in FIPS-validated modules. The FIPS 140 specification, Security Requirements
for Cryptographic Modules, defines how cryptographic modules are validated. 16 It is important to note
that for a remote access system to be considered compliant to FIPS 140, both sides of the interaction must
have passed FIPS 140 validation. Many remote access systems, such as SSL VPNs, support the use of
remote access client software from other vendors, so there may be two or more distinct validation
certificates for a particular remote access system. 17

Some remote access methods, such as IPsec and SSL VPNs, often inherently include NIST-approved
mechanisms for encrypting communications and verifying their integrity. Other remote access methods
may use Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other NIST-approved cryptographic mechanisms to provide
protection. Remote access methods that do not offer NIST-approved mechanisms for protecting the
confidentiality and integrity of communications should have additional NIST-approved protection
applied, such as tunneling the remote access method’s communications within a VPN or running the
communications over TLS. Remote access methods that offer both NIST-approved and non-NIST-
approved cryptographic mechanisms should disable the use of all non-approved cryptographic
mechanisms if possible. This is usually achieved through configuration of the remote access server. All
remote access methods should conform to the key strength requirements listed in NIST SP 800-56A,
Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography.

Access control for network communications may also involve determining which traffic should be
protected. Some remote access solutions offer options for this; for example, many VPN clients have a
feature called split tunneling which, if enabled, will tunnel all communications involving the
organization’s internal resources through the VPN, thus protecting them, but will exclude all other
communications from going through the tunnel. Split tunneling increases efficiency for communications
and reduces load on the remote access solution, but it also prevents the organization from examining
much of the teleworkers’ network traffic and from protecting the confidentiality and integrity of that
traffic. Further, using split tunneling could result in a telework device that has two active Internet
interfaces—for example, a PC connected to Ethernet and wireless network simultaneously—inadvertently
becoming a bridge between a trusted and an untrusted network. This presents a significant security risk
and is a violation of most organizations’ security policies. For teleworkers using VPNs on untrusted
networks, particularly higher-risk networks such as wireless hotspots, organizations should consider
disabling split tunneling capabilities so that attackers cannot eavesdrop on any of the teleworkers’
network communications.

For their teleworkers’ home networks, some organizations provide VPN gateways, firewall appliances, or
other security devices that are configured to enforce the organization’s security policies. This gives
organizations greater control over telework security but may also involve significant costs in purchasing,
deploying, managing, and maintaining the security devices. Also, because most home networks used for
16

17
     Note that SSL version 3.0 and below are not NIST-approved; only SSL version 3.1 and above (also known as TLS version
     1.0 and above) are approved.

                                                    GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



telework are also used for other purposes, the security policies could interfere with other use of the home
network if not designed properly. Another drawback is that the security devices, if stolen by or otherwise
acquired by an attacker, could grant an attacker easy access to the organization’s systems if the
organization’s remote access solution authenticates the security device only and not the remote access
user. Therefore, when such security devices are used, both the device and the user should be authenticated
by the organization.

3.3.4    Access Control for Applications

Different types of remote access architectures offer different levels of granularity for application access
control. Tunnels often have a mechanism for an administrator to specify which ports on which hosts the
teleworker has access to; this can limit access so that only specific applications can be used. Portals, by
their nature, limit the teleworker to applications run on the portal server. Similarly, direct application
access limits the teleworker to a specific application on a single server. Remote desktop access can only
provide access control to applications by combining its policies with the access control restrictions that
are in place on the internal workstations.

Putting limits on which applications teleworkers can access does not necessarily prevent teleworkers from
affecting other resources, because the applications being run may have access to other network resources.
For example, a web server that the teleworker accesses may cause lookups on database servers, data
retrieval from file servers, and other actions involving additional servers. Thus, the policy of limiting a
teleworker to particular applications should be considered in light of what other applications and hosts
those applications can interact with.

3.4     Remote Access Client Software Security

Another important element of remote access solution security is the security configuration of remote
access client software. Many remote access clients have security features and settings that can be
remotely managed by a system administrator. Such management is particularly important for client
software that has complex security settings. For example, many users have difficulty with manually
setting IPsec configurations or authentication options for remote desktop access. If the client has remote
management capabilities, an administrator can view its configuration, reconfigure it, and possibly lock the
configuration. Locking ensures that security settings are not inadvertently or intentionally altered, which
could reduce remote access security. However, there is no standardization for remote management
capabilities or interfaces, and many remote access systems do not have remote management features for
their client software.

Organizations should carefully plan how remote access client software security will be maintained and
managed before selecting and deploying a remote access solution. More broadly, organizations should
also plan how the telework client devices that they provide to teleworkers will be managed and supported,
such as a help desk agent remotely accessing a device to perform troubleshooting of operational problems
reported by a teleworker. If not properly secured, remote management capabilities can be misused by
attackers to compromise telework client devices and use them to gain access to an organization’s internal
resources. Therefore, organizations should ensure that remote management is properly secured,
particularly encrypting network communications and performing mutual authentication of endpoints.

Organizations should also consider the “thickness” of remote access client software. A remote access
client is considered thick if it is configured so that the organization has nearly complete control over the
remote access environment. For example, many VPN clients can be configured to be very thick, such as
tunneling all network communications from the client device to the organization’s network, using the
organization’s Domain Name System (DNS) services instead of the local network’s DNS services, and


                                                     3-7
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



hard-coding the IP address of the VPN gateway instead of relying on local name resolution of the DNS
server’s name. However, many VPN clients can also be configured to be thin, which means that the client
uses a common application already present on the telework device, such as a web browser. With a thin
VPN client, the organization has considerably less control over the remote access environment as
compared to a thick client. A thin VPN client might rely on local network services and permit
communications not involving the organization’s internal resources to be passed unprotected across
public networks. Some types of remote access solutions, such as portals, remote desktop access, and
direct application access, have inherently thin remote access clients.

Thin remote access clients are generally more flexible and efficient than thick clients, but they also cause
a greater risk of error and compromise—for example, a user could mistype a portal server’s URL in a web
browser and reach a fraudulent web site. Thick clients help ensure that clients are communicating with
legitimate remote access servers and other resources. Organizations with higher security needs or with
particularly high risks against their remote access communications should use thick remote access clients
whenever possible to reduce the risk of compromise.

3.5    Summary of Key Recommendations

The following list presents some of the key recommendations from this section of the document.

 The security of remote access servers is particularly important. Recommendations for general server
  security are available from NIST SP 800-123, Guide to General Server Security. Remote access
  servers should be kept fully patched, operated using an organization-defined security configuration
  baseline, and only managed from trusted hosts by authorized administrators. (Section 3.1)
 Organizations should carefully consider the security of any remote access solutions that involve
  running a remote access server on the same host as other services and applications. (Section 3.1)
 Organizations should consider several major factors when determining where to place a remote access
  server, including device performance, traffic examination, unprotected traffic, and NAT.
  Organizations should place remote access servers at the network perimeter unless there are
  compelling reasons to do otherwise. (Section 3.2)
 To ensure that access is restricted properly, remote access servers should authenticate each teleworker
  before granting any access to the organization’s resources, and then use authorization technologies to
  ensure that only the necessary resources can be used. Whenever feasible, organizations should
  implement mutual authentication, so that a remote access user can verify the legitimacy of a remote
  access server before providing authentication credentials to it. (Section 3.3)
 Any sensitive information from remote access communications passing over the Internet, wireless
  networks, and other untrusted networks should have its confidentiality and integrity preserved
  through use of cryptography. Federal agencies are required to use cryptographic algorithms that are
  NIST-approved and contained in FIPS-validated modules. (Section 3.3)
 Organizations should carefully plan how remote access client software security will be maintained
  and managed before selecting and deploying a remote access solution. Organizations should also plan
  how the telework client devices that they provide to teleworkers will be managed and supported.
  Organizations should ensure that remote management is properly secured, particularly encrypting
  network communications and performing mutual authentication of endpoints. (Section 3.4)
 Organizations with higher security needs or with particularly high risks against their remote access
  communications should use thick remote access clients whenever possible to reduce the risk of
  compromise. (Section 3.4)

4.    Telework Client Device Security

Telework client devices can be divided into two general categories:

 Personal computers (PC), which are desktop and laptop computers running standard PC operating
  systems (OS), such as Windows Vista, Windows XP, Linux/Unix, and Mac OS X. PCs can be used
  for any of the remote access methods described in this section.
 Consumer devices, which are small, usually mobile computers. Examples of consumer devices are
  networking-capable PDAs, cell phones, and video game systems. Consumer devices are most often
  used for web-based remote access, such as web-based portals or direct access to web-based
  applications, but consumer devices are increasingly supporting other forms of remote access as well.
  Consumer devices are often owned by individuals, but some types of devices are frequently owned
  and distributed by organizations as well.
The difference between PCs and consumer devices is decreasing. Some current consumer devices run
standard PC OSs, but these are often not intended for users to access directly. Also, consumer devices are
increasingly offering more functionality previously provided only by PCs.

The rest of this publication provides separate recommendations for PCs and consumer devices, where
applicable. Another set of categories used in the recommendations is the party that is responsible for the
security of the client device. These categories are as follows:

 Organization. Client devices in this category are usually acquired, configured, and managed by the
  organization. These devices can be used for any of the organization’s remote access methods.
 Teleworker. These client devices are owned by the teleworker, who is ultimately responsible for
  securing them and maintaining their security. These devices are usually capable of using many or all
  of the organization’s remote access methods, if permitted.
 Third party. These client devices are owned, configured, and secured by third parties, such as kiosk
  computers at hotels, and PCs or consumer devices owned by friends and family. Remote access
  options for third party-secured devices are typically quite limited because users cannot or should not
  install software onto them, and even advanced teleworkers cannot force most third-party devices to
  implement even rudimentary security precautions.
In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to telework client devices. These threats are
posed by people with many different motivations, including causing mischief and disruption, and
committing identity theft and other forms of fraud. The primary threat against most telework client
devices is malware, including viruses, worms, malicious mobile code, Trojan horses, rootkits, and
spyware. Malware threats can infect client devices through many means, including email, Web sites, file
downloads and file sharing, peer-to-peer software, and instant messaging. The use of unauthorized
removable media, such as flash drives, is an increasingly common transmission mechanism for malware.
Another common threat against telework client devices is loss or theft of the device. Someone with
physical access to a device has many options for attempting to view or copy the information stored on it.
An attacker with physical access can also add malware to a device that gives them access to data accessed
from or entered into the device, such as users’ passwords typed into a laptop keyboard.

Permitting teleworkers to remotely access an organization’s computing resources gives attackers
additional opportunities to breach the organization’s security. When a client device uses remote access, it
is essentially an extension of the organization’s own network. If the device is not secured properly, it
poses additional risk not only to the information that the teleworker accesses, but also to the


                                                    4-1
                                                               GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



organization’s other systems and networks. Therefore, telework client devices should be secured properly
and have their security maintained regularly.

Generally, telework client devices should have the same local security controls as other client devices in
the enterprise—OS and application security updates applied promptly, unneeded services disabled,
antimalware software and a personal firewall enabled and kept up-to-date, etc. However, because of the
threats that client devices face in external environments, additional security controls are recommended,
and some security controls may need to be adjusted to work effectively in telework environments. For
example, storing sensitive data on a desktop computer housed at an organization’s headquarters has
different ramifications than storing the same data on a laptop used at several external locations. This
section discusses recommendations for securing telework client devices and the data that they contain.

Organizations should be responsible for securing their own telework client devices and should also
require their users to implement and maintain appropriate, often similar, levels of security for personally-
owned client devices that they use for telework. The mechanisms for securing organization-owned and
personally-owned telework client devices are similar, but some of the security controls might not be
feasible for teleworkers to implement on their own. See NIST SP 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing
External Devices for Telework and Remote Access, for recommendations for users securing their own
telework client devices. Section 5 contains additional discussion of the feasibility of relying on users to
establish and maintain the security of devices.

4.1      Securing Telework PCs

One of the most important security measures for a telework PC is having a properly configured personal
firewall installed and enabled. Personal firewalls are needed to stop network-based threats in many
environments. If a personal firewall has a single policy for all environments, then it is likely to be too
restrictive at times, such as when on the organization’s internal network, and not restrictive enough at
other times, such as when on a third-party external wireless network. So personal firewalls capable of
supporting multiple policies should be used whenever possible and configured properly for the enterprise
environment and an external environment, at a minimum.

Many firewalls require the user to manually select the appropriate policy or environment from a list, but
some personal firewalls can be configured to “auto-sense” the network they are on and choose a security
policy based on that information. Although auto-sensing helps to automate the security process, it may
not always work correctly and could apply the wrong policy at times, making the computer insecure or
blocking needed functionality. Thus, organizations that want to use auto-sensing features should test them
thoroughly before relying on them, as well as educating users on how they work and how users can
override them if the wrong policy has been selected. Auto-sensing features should only be used if they
notify the teleworker what environment the feature thinks the user is in so that the user can override it if
the auto-sensing feature has misidentified the environment.

Another important consideration for telework PCs is applying OS and application security updates. 18 For
personally-owned telework PCs, this generally involves configuring the OS and applications to
automatically contact the vendors’ online services frequently to check for updates and download and
install them. Determining how to configure organization-controlled telework PCs to acquire updates can
be significantly more complicated. An organization might wish to use a centralized patch management
system for all its PCs, but if telework PCs rely on such a system, they may not receive updates promptly
if they are configured to get updates only from the organization’s centralized patch management system.
18
      Generally, the most important applications to keep up-to-date are those that are used for security (e.g., antimalware software,
      personal firewalls) or remote access, and those that are network-capable and frequent vectors for exploits, such as Web
      browsers, email clients, and instant messaging clients.


                                                                4-2
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



For example, a user might connect a telework PC to an external network but not establish a remote access
connection to the organization. The PC may be exposed to threats that could exploit its unpatched
vulnerabilities, and patches would not be available until some time after the user established a remote
access session. Another potential problem with keeping software updated is that remote access sessions
may be brief, particularly if the teleworker is on travel. This might preclude larger updates from being
downloaded if the software performing the updates does not permit updates to be downloaded in pieces.

Organizations should carefully consider these issues when planning how their telework PCs will be kept
current with OS and application updates. Organizations should also encourage users to fully update their
telework PCs before taking them on travel or to other third-party environments, which are generally more
likely to contain new threats than home networks.

Other security measures that are particularly important for telework include the following:

 Have a separate user account with limited privileges for each person that will use the telework PC.
  Teleworkers should use their limited privilege accounts for regular work and use a separate
  administrative account only for tasks that require administrator-level access, such as some software
  updates. This reduces the likelihood of an attacker gaining administrator-level access to the PC.
 Enforce session locking, which prevents access to the PC after it has been idle for a period of time
  (such as 15 minutes) or permits the user to lock a session upon demand. After a session is locked,
  access to the PC can only be restored through authentication. Session locking is often part of screen-
  saver software. This prevents an attacker within physical proximity of a PC from easily gaining
  access to the current session. However, it does not thwart an attacker who steals a PC or has access to
  it for an extended period of time; session locking can be circumvented through various techniques.
 Physically secure telework PCs by using cable locks or other deterrents to theft. This is most
  important for telework PCs in untrusted external environments, but is relevant for any environment,
  including home offices.
In cases where organizations are concerned about risk from inadequate telework PC security, particularly
from PCs that are not organization-controlled or are otherwise at higher risk of compromise,
organizations may want to consider different security controls in addition to or instead of those described
above. For example, some vendors offer solutions that provide a bootable OS on read-only removable
media with pre-configured remote access client software. A user can insert this media into a PC and
reboot the computer; this bypasses the PC’s OS, which may be compromised, and loads the known-good
OS and remote access client software from the removable media. In most cases, these solutions can be
configured to prevent users from storing files on the local hard drive, saving files to removable media,
and otherwise transferring information from the known-good OS to another location. Bootable OS
solutions make the logical security of the telework PC much less important, although they do not prevent
all compromises (for example, vulnerabilities in the removable media’s OS could be exploited, or
malicious code may be present in the PC’s BIOS, firmware, or hardware). Another caveat with these
solutions is that they require the PC to support booting the removable media before the hard drive, which
may require the user to reconfigure the PC’s BIOS settings.

Another option is to provide teleworkers with flash drives that are specifically configured for telework
use. These drives hold organization-approved applications that are executed from a read-only portion of
the drives, which protects them from unauthorized modification. Temporary files from these applications
are stored in another portion of the flash drives, which reduces the likelihood of data leakage onto the PC.

4.2   Securing Telework Consumer Devices

Many organization-controlled telework consumer devices can have their security managed centrally, at
least to some degree. Organizations should take advantage of such security management capabilities
whenever available—for example, by restricting the installation and use of third-party applications on cell
phones and PDAs. However, many devices, including those not controlled by the organization, will need
to be secured manually. Security capabilities and appropriate actions vary widely by device type and
specific products, so organizations should provide guidance to device administrators and users who are
responsible for securing telework consumer devices on how they should secure them.

NIST SP 800-124, Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security, recommends safeguards for the most
common types of telework consumer devices. The following are examples of these safeguards:

 Limit the networking capabilities of consumer devices. This is particularly important for devices that
  have multiple wireless capabilities; the teleworker might not even know that some wireless protocols
  are exposing the device to access by attackers. Even for devices with a single network connection, it
  is important to prevent users from inadvertently connecting the device to unintended host devices
  through technologies such as Bluetooth and shared wireless networking.
 For devices that face significant malware threats, run antimalware programs. Devices that connect to
  the Internet may even have personal firewalls; these should be enabled to prevent attacks and
  unauthorized access.
 Determine if the device manufacturer provides updates and patches; if so, ensure that they are applied
  promptly to protect the device from attacks against known vulnerabilities.
Given the similarity between the functions of consumer devices, particularly as they become more
advanced, and PCs, organizations should strongly consider treating them similar to, or the same as, PCs.
This means that organizational policies for PCs may simply be extended to consumer devices; if the two
policies are kept separate, the policy documents should heavily cross-reference each other.

4.3   Protecting Data on Telework Client Devices

Telework usually involves creating and editing work-related information such as email, word processing
documents, and spreadsheets. Because that data is important, it should be treated like other important
assets of the organization. Two things an organization can do to protect data on telework devices are to
secure it on the telework device and to periodically back it up to a location controlled by the organization.
More information on this is provided in Sections 4.3.1 through 4.3.3. Organizations can also choose not to
allow the organization’s information to be stored on telework devices, but to instead store it centrally at
the organization.

Sensitive information, such as certain types of personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., personnel
records, medical records, financial records), that is stored on or sent to or from telework devices should be
protected so that malicious parties cannot access or alter it. For example, teleworkers often forget that
storing sensitive information on a CD-ROM that is carried with their device, or printing the information
on a public printer, can also expose the information in ways that are not significant within a typical
enterprise environment. An unauthorized release of sensitive information could damage the public’s trust
in an organization, jeopardize the organization’s mission, or harm individuals if their personal
information has been released.

4.3.1   Encrypting Data at Rest

All telework devices, regardless of their size or location, can be stolen. Some thieves may want to read
the contents of the data on the device, and quite possibly use that data for criminal purposes. To prevent
this, an organization should have a policy of encrypting all sensitive data when it is at rest on the device
and on removable media used by the device. The creation and use of cryptographic keys for encrypting
remote data at rest should follow the same policies that an organization has for other keys that protect data
at rest.

There are many methods for protecting data at rest, and they mostly depend on the type of device or
removable media that is being protected. Some operating systems have their own data encryption
mechanisms, and there are also numerous third-party applications that provide similar capabilities. See
NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices, for more
information on encrypting storage on client devices and removable media. Generally, when technologies
such as full disk encryption are being used to protect data at rest, teleworkers should shut down their
telework devices instead of placing them into sleep mode when the devices will not be used for an
extended time or when the teleworker will not be with the device. This helps ensure that the data at rest is
protected by the storage encryption technology.

4.3.2   Using Virtual Machines

If an organization has direct control over a telework device, the organization can enforce its policies for
remote access, updating, etc. For other telework devices, such as PCs personally owned by teleworkers,
the organization has a limited ability to enforce security policies. A method for controlling the
environment in which a teleworker operates is to run a virtual machine (VM) on the telework PC. This is
normally done by running a VM hypervisor program within the telework PC’s operating system, but
some newer telework PCs allow the installation of a hypervisor that runs in place of the PC’s operating
system. This is known as a bare-metal hypervisor. Bare-metal hypervisors are generally considered more
secure than other hypervisors because there is one less major piece of software that can be attacked.

A user runs a VM image in the virtual machine environment; this image acts just like a full computer with
an operating system and application software. (Using virtual machines as telework devices is an extension
of the concept of thin clients.) To use VM images to enforce telework policy, the organization distributes
a VM image that is configured to be fully compliant with all relevant security policies. The teleworker
runs the VM image on the telework computer. When the image needs to be updated, the organization
distributes a new image to its teleworkers. Using a VM to support telework security works well as long as
the telework computer itself does not have any malware that will attack the VM. For hypervisors that run
within the host OS (i.e., not bare-metal hypervisors), any compromise within the host OS could affect the
security of the VM and the VM image.

VM disks act just like the disks on a regular computer, so organizations should have policies for telework
data that is stored in a VM image. VM images can be encrypted on the telework computer when they are
not in use and only decrypted after the user provides proper authentication just before booting an image.
If VM images are encrypted, an unauthorized person that gets access to the telework device will not be
able to read the data stored in the VM image. Similarly, a VM image can have multiple disks within it,
and some of those can be encrypted; if the teleworker stores their data on an encrypted disk within the
VM, it will be just as if the data were stored on an encrypted disk directly on the telework computer.

Organizations should consider encrypting all VM images used for telework to reduce the risk of
compromise. This can be accomplished through the use of full disk encryption, file encryption, or other




                                                    4-5

means. 19 For high-risk situations, particularly involving access to highly sensitive information,
organizations should encrypt each individual VM image used for telework and may also want to provide a
second layer of protection through full disk encryption.

4.3.3     Backing Up Data on Telework Devices

Most organizations have policies for backing up data on a regular basis. Such a backup policy should
cover data on telework PCs and, if relevant and feasible, consumer devices. However, such a policy may
need different provisions for backups performed at the organization’s facilities versus external locations.
If the data to be backed up contains sensitive information or needs its confidentiality protected for other
reasons, there are additional security considerations if that backup is performed at an external location.

If data is being backed up remotely—from the telework device to a system at the organization—then the
communications carrying that data should be encrypted and have their integrity verified. This is discussed
in more detail in Section 3.3.3. If data is being backed up locally—to removable media such as CD-R
disks or USB flash drives, for example—the backup should be protected at least as well as the original
data is. For example, if the original data is encrypted, then the data in the backup should be encrypted as
well. If the original data is encrypted in a portable form, such as through virtual disk encryption or an
encrypted VM image, then it may be sufficient to copy that encrypted entity onto the backup media.
However, for non-portable forms of storage encryption, such as full disk encryption, the data would need
to be decrypted on the telework device and then encrypted for storage on the backup media.

4.4      Summary of Key Recommendations

The following list presents some of the key recommendations from this section of the document.

 Telework client devices should be secured properly and have their security maintained regularly.
  Generally, telework client devices should have the same local security controls as other client devices
  in the enterprise. However, because of the threats that client devices face in external environments,
  additional security controls are recommended, and some security controls may need to be adjusted to
  work effectively in telework environments. (Section 4 introduction)
 For telework PCs, personal firewalls capable of supporting multiple policies should be used whenever
  possible and configured properly for the enterprise environment and an external environment, at a
  minimum. (Section 4.1)
 For telework consumer devices, organizations should take advantage of centralized security
  management capabilities whenever available. However, many devices, including those not controlled
  by the organization, will need to be secured manually. Organizations should provide guidance to
  device administrators and users who are responsible for securing telework consumer devices on how
  they should secure them. (Section 4.2)
 Sensitive information, such as certain types of PII (e.g., personnel records, medical records, financial
  records), that is stored on or sent to or from telework devices should be protected so that malicious
  parties cannot access or alter it. An organization should have a policy of encrypting all sensitive data
  when it is at rest on the device and on removable media used by the device. The creation and use of
  cryptographic keys for encrypting remote data at rest should follow the same policies that an
  organization has for other keys that protect data at rest. (Section 4.3)

5.      Security Considerations for the Telework and Remote Access Life Cycle

This section brings together the concepts presented in the previous sections of the guide and explains how
they should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of telework and remote access solutions,
involving everything from policy to operations. The section references a five-phase life cycle model to
help organizations determine at what point in their telework and remote access deployments a
recommendation may be relevant. This model is based on one introduced in NIST SP 800-64, Security
Considerations in the System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project management
methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in the model presented here, but
the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are probably similar. The phases of the life
cycle are as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation. This phase includes the tasks that an organization should perform before it starts
  to design a telework or remote access solution. These include identifying needs for telework and
  remote access, providing an overall vision for how telework and remote access solutions would
  support the mission of the organization, creating a high-level strategy for implementing telework and
  remote access solutions, developing a telework security policy, and specifying business and
  functional requirements for the solution.
 Phase 2: Development. In this phase, personnel specify the technical characteristics of the telework
  or remote access solution and related components. These include the authentication methods; the
  cryptographic mechanisms used to protect communications; and firewalls and other mechanisms used
  to control access to networks and resources on those networks. The types of telework clients to be
  used should also be considered, since they can affect the desired policies. Care should be taken to
  ensure that the telework security policy can be employed and enforced by all clients. At the end of
  this phase, solution components are procured.
 Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, equipment is configured to meet operational and security
  requirements, including the telework security policy documented in the system security plan, installed
  and tested as a prototype, and then activated on a production network. Implementation includes
  altering the configuration of other security controls and technologies, such as security event logging,
  network management, and authentication server integration.
 Phase 4: Operations and Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an
  organization should perform on an ongoing basis once the telework or remote access solution is
  operational, including log review and attack detection. These tasks should be documented in the
  configuration management policy.
 Phase 5: Disposal. This phase encompasses tasks that occur when a remote access solution or its
  components are being retired, including preserving information to meet legal requirements, sanitizing
  media, and disposing of equipment properly. 20
This section highlights security considerations of particular interest for telework and remote access
solutions. These considerations are not intended to be comprehensive, nor is there any implication that
security elements not listed here are unimportant or unnecessary.

5.1     Initiation

The initiation phase involves many preparatory actions, such as identifying current and future needs, and
specifying requirements for performance, functionality, and security. A critical part of the initiation phase

20
      The life cycle information presented in this introduction is derived from Section 8 of NIST SP 800-97.


                                                               5-1
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



is the development of a telework security policy for an organization. The section lists elements that a
telework security policy should contain and, where relevant, describes some of the factors that should be
considered when making the decisions behind each element. A telework security policy should define
which forms of remote access the organization permits, which types of telework devices are permitted to
use each form of remote access, the type of access each type of teleworker is granted, and how user
account provisioning should be handled. It should also cover how the organization's remote access servers
are administered and how policies in those servers are updated. The telework security policy should be
documented in the system security plan.

In addition to the considerations described in this section for telework security policies, organizations
should also consider how other security policies may be affected by telework. For example, an
organization may require that certain types of locked-out user accounts be unlocked only in person, but
this may not be viable for teleworkers who are on travel or on long-term assignments in external
locations. Other security policies should be adjusted as needed to take telework into consideration.

5.1.1   Permitted Forms of Remote Access

One of the first decisions to make when creating a telework security policy is which types of remote
access solutions will be permitted. Each type of solution has its strengths and weaknesses, and the
usefulness of each will depend on many factors within the organization. Some of those factors include:

 Existing remote access used by the organization, such as remote control systems used by IT staff
 Software already installed on telework devices that can be used for remote access
 Capabilities available in firewalls that are already installed at the edge of the organization's network.
The policy for which types of remote access are permitted for telework should be closely tied to the
organization's overall security policy. If one of the forms of remote access under consideration cannot be
secured in a fashion that is required by the organization's security policy, such as using approved
cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data, then that form of remote access should not be used by
the organization. The overall security policy should take priority when creating a telework security policy.

5.1.2   Restrictions on Telework Client Devices and Remote Access Levels

A telework security policy can limit the types of client devices that teleworkers are allowed to use. For a
variety of reasons, including security policies and technology limitations, organizations often limit which
types of devices can be used for remote access. For example, an organization might permit only
organization-owned PCs to be used. Some organizations have tiered levels of access, such as allowing
organization-owned PCs to access many resources, teleworker-owned PCs to access a limited set of
resources, and consumer devices and third-party PCs to access only one or two resources, such as Web-
based email. This allows an organization to limit the risk it incurs by permitting the most-controlled
devices to have the most access and the least-controlled devices to have minimal access.

Each organization should make its own risk-based decisions about what levels of remote access should be
permitted from which types of devices. Factors that organizations should consider when setting telework
security policy for this include the following:

 Sensitivity of telework. Some telework involves access to sensitive information or resources, while
  other telework does not. Organizations may have more restrictive requirements for telework involving
  sensitive information, such as permitting only organization-controlled telework devices to be used.




                                                    5-2
                                                   GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



 The level of confidence in security policy compliance. Meeting many of an organization’s security
  requirements can typically be ensured only if the organization controls the configuration of the
  telework devices. For personally owned devices, some requirements can be verified by automated
  security health checks conducted by the remote access server on devices attempting to connect, but
  other requirements cannot be verified by the organization by automated means. Making users aware
  of their responsibilities can help to improve security on personally owned telework devices, but will
  not result in the same degree of security policy compliance as mandatory security controls enforced
  on organization-controlled telework devices. Even the most conscientious users may fail to properly
  maintain the security of their personally owned devices at all times because of the technical
  complexity or effort involved or their lack of awareness of new threats.
 Cost. Costs associated with telework devices will vary based on policy decisions. The primary direct
  cost is issuing telework devices and client software to teleworkers. There are also indirect costs in
  maintaining telework devices and in providing technical support for teleworkers. Another
  consideration related to cost is telework frequency and duration; an organization might justify
  purchasing telework devices for individuals who telework regularly (e.g., one day per week from
  home, frequent business travel), but not purchasing telework devices for individuals who telework
  only occasionally for short durations, such as quickly checking email from home a few evenings a
  month.
 Telework location. Risks will generally be lower for devices used only in the home environment
  than for devices in a variety of other locations. Also, as discussed in Section 3.3, in some cases the
  organization can automatically determine the teleworker’s location (i.e., identify whether the device is
  on an authorized home network), in which case policies could be enforced based on location.
 Technical limitations. Certain types of devices may be needed for particular telework needs, such as
  running specialized programs locally. Also, if an organization has a single type of remote access
  server, and that server can only allow connections through a custom client that is installed on the
  telework device, then only the types of devices that can support the client are allowed.
 Compliance with mandates and other policies. Organizations may need to comply with telework-
  related requirements from mandates and other sources, such as a Federal department issuing policy
  requirements to its member agencies. An example of a possible requirement is restrictions on
  performing telework in foreign countries that have strong known threats against Federal agency
  systems.
Organizations may choose to specify additional security requirements that are tied to factors such as the
sensitivity of telework. Many organizations require more stringent security controls for telework
situations that are particularly high-risk. Security requirements that may be particularly helpful for such
situations include the following:

 Permit high-risk telework only from organization-issued and secured telework devices.
 Require the use of multi-factor authentication for access to the telework device and to remote access
  solutions.
 Use storage encryption on the telework device, at a minimum to protect all sensitive information.
  Multiple levels of encryption may be needed. For example, full disk encryption may be needed to
  mitigate an attacker who gains physical access to the device; at the same time, virtual disk encryption
  or file/folder encryption may be needed to mitigate an attacker who gains logical access to the device
  (i.e., access after full disk encryption authentication has occurred and the data on the hard drive is
  being decrypted automatically as needed). Removable media containing telework data should also be
  encrypted.


                                                     5-3
                                                            GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



 Migrate high-risk resources to servers that assume responsibility for protecting them. For example, a
  teleworker could connect to a terminal server that holds sensitive data that the teleworker needs to
  access.
 Store and access only the minimum data necessary. Some organizations issue “loaner” devices that
  are completely wiped before and after the high-risk telework is performed. Only the data and
  authorized applications needed for the telework are loaded onto the loaner device. The pre-use wiping
  ensures that the device is clean before any telework is conducted, and the post-use wiping ensures that
  no telework data remains that could be accessed in the future.
In high-risk situations, organizations may also choose to reduce risk by prohibiting telework and remote
access involving particular types of information, such as highly sensitive personally identifiable
information (PII). 21

Every year, there are many changes in telework device capabilities, the security controls available to
organizations, the types of threats made to different types of devices, and so on. Therefore, organizations
should periodically reassess their policies for telework devices and consider changing which types of
client devices are permitted and what levels of access they may be granted. Organizations should also be
aware of the emergence of new types of remote access solutions and of major changes to existing remote
access technologies, and ensure that the organization’s policies are updated accordingly as needed.

5.1.3    Additional User Requirements

Organizations often have additional security considerations for telework that, while helpful in mitigating
threats, cannot be directly enforced by the organization. Organizations should educate users on the
importance of these additional security measures and define teleworkers’ responsibilities for
implementing these measures in policy and telework agreements.

One example of a possible security consideration is phone services. Depending on the sensitivity of
telework communications, telephone security may be a consideration. Corded phones using traditional
wired telephone networks cannot be intercepted without physical connections, so they are sufficiently
secure for typical telework. Cordless phones using traditional wired telephone networks should employ
spread spectrum technology to scramble transmissions, thus reducing the risk of eavesdropping within
physical proximity (usually a few hundred yards at most). Digital cell phones should be acceptable for
typical telework. 22 Communications carried over voice over IP (VoIP) services should not be considered
secure unless some form of encryption is used; however, many VoIP services now provide strong
encryption, which should be used to protect sensitive and proprietary information. Any encryption used
must be certified to follow NIST requirements. The FIPS 140 specification, Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules, defines how cryptographic modules are validated.

Another possible security consideration involves wireless personal area networks (WPAN), which are
small-scale wireless networks that require no infrastructure to operate. Examples of WPAN technologies
are using a wireless keyboard or mouse with a computer, printing wirelessly, synchronizing a PDA with a
computer, and allowing a wireless headset or earpiece to be used with a cell phone. The two most
commonly used types of WPAN technologies are Bluetooth and infrared. For devices within proximity of

     Identifiable Information (PII).
22
     Analog cell phone communications can be intercepted by individuals with scanning equipment, so their use should be
     avoided when discussing sensitive or proprietary information. However, nearly all analog cell phone networks have been
     retired.


                                                             5-4

threats, teleworkers should disable these technologies when not in use to prevent misuse by unauthorized
parties.

Additional information on these security considerations is available from NIST SP 800-114, User’s Guide
to Securing External Devices for Telework and Remote Access, and NIST SP 800-121, Guide to Bluetooth
Security.

5.2     Development

Once the organization has established a telework security policy, identified telework and remote access
needs, and completed other preparatory activities, the next step is to determine which types of telework or
remote access technologies should be used and to design a solution to deploy. There are many
considerations for designing a solution, most of which are generally applicable to any IT technology;
some of these are covered in Section 2.1 of this document and NIST SP 800-53. This section focuses on
the technical security considerations that are most important for designing telework and remote access
solutions. Major considerations include the following: 23

 Architecture. Designing the architecture includes the placement of the remote access server and the
  selection of remote access client software (if needed).
 Authentication. Authentication involves selecting a remote access authentication method, as
  described in Section 3, and determining how its client/user and server components should be
  implemented, including procedures for issuing and resetting authenticators and for provisioning users
  and client devices with authenticators.
 Cryptography. Decisions related to cryptography include selecting the algorithms for encryption and
  integrity protection of remote access communications, and setting the key strength for algorithms that
  support multiple key lengths.
 Access Control. This involves determining which types of remote access communications should be
  permitted and denied. Section 3 provides additional information on access control capabilities.
 Endpoint Security. Endpoint security decisions involve determining how remote access servers and
  telework client devices should be secured, as described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.
The security aspects of the telework and remote access solution design should be documented in the
system security plan. The organization should also consider how incidents involving the telework and
remote access solutions should be handled and document those plans as well. 24

5.3     Implementation

After the remote access solution has been designed, the next step is to implement and test a prototype of
the design, before putting the solution into production. Aspects of the solution that should be evaluated
include the following: 25

 Connectivity. Users can establish and maintain remote access connections. Users can connect to all
  of the resources that they are permitted to and cannot connect to any other resources.



23
      These considerations are based on material from Section 4 of NIST SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs.
24
      For more information on incident handling, see NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.
25
      These considerations are based on material from Section 4 of NIST SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs.

                                                 GUIDE TO ENTERPRISE TELEWORK AND REMOTE ACCESS SECURITY



 Protection. Each traffic flow is protected in accordance with the established requirements. This
  includes flows between the telework client device and the remote access server, and between the
  remote access server and internal resources. Protection should be verified by means such as
  monitoring network traffic or checking traffic logs.
 Authentication. Authentication is required and cannot be readily compromised or circumvented. All
  authentication policies are enforced. Performing robust testing of authentication is important to
  reduce the risk of attackers accessing protected internal resources.
 Applications. The remote access solution does not interfere with the use of software applications that
  are permitted to be used through remote access, nor does it disrupt the operation of telework client
  devices (for example, a VPN client conflicting with a host-based firewall).
 Management. Administrators can configure and manage the solution effectively and securely. This
  includes all components, including remote access servers, authentication services, and client software.
  The ease of deployment and configuration is particularly important, such as having fully automated
  client configuration versus administrators manually configuring each client. Another concern is the
  ability of users to alter remote access client settings, which could weaken remote access security.
  Automating configurations for devices can greatly reduce unintentional errors from users incorrectly
  configuring settings.
 Logging. The remote access solution logs security events in accordance with the organization’s
  policies. Some remote access solutions provide more granular logging capabilities than others—for
  example, logging usage of individual applications versus only connections to particular hosts—so in
  some cases it may be necessary to rely on the resources used through remote access to perform
  portions of the logging that the remote access server cannot perform.
 Performance. The solution provides adequate performance during normal and peak usage. It is
  important to consider not only the performance of the primary remote access components, but also
  that of intermediate devices, such as routers and firewalls. Performance is particularly important when
  large software updates are being provided through the remote access solution to telework client
  devices. Encrypted traffic often consumes more processing power than unencrypted traffic, so it may
  cause bottlenecks. In many cases, the best way to test the performance under load of a prototype is to
  use simulated traffic generators on a live test network to mimic the actual characteristics of expected
  traffic as closely as possible. Testing should incorporate a variety of applications that will be used
  with remote access.
 Security of the Implementation. The remote access implementation itself may contain
  vulnerabilities and weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Organizations with high security needs
  may choose to perform extensive vulnerability assessments against the remote access components. At
  a minimum, all components should be updated with the latest patches and configured following sound
  security practices.
 Default Settings. Implementers should carefully review the default values for each remote access
  setting and alter the settings as necessary to support security requirements. Implementers should also
  ensure that the remote access solution does not unexpectedly “fall back” to default settings for
  interoperability or other reasons.

5.4     Operations and Maintenance

Operational processes that are particularly helpful for maintaining telework and remote access security,
and thus should be performed regularly, include the following: 26

 Checking for upgrades and patches to the remote access software components, and acquiring, testing,
  and deploying the updates
 Ensuring that each remote access infrastructure component (servers, gateways, authentication servers,
  etc.) has its clock synched to a common time source so that its timestamps will match those generated
  by other systems
 Reconfiguring access control features as needed based on factors such as policy changes, technology
  changes, audit findings, and new security needs
 Detecting and documenting anomalies detected within the remote access infrastructure. Such
  anomalies might indicate malicious activity or deviations from policy and procedures. Anomalies
  should be reported to other systems’ administrators as appropriate.
Organizations should also periodically perform assessments to confirm that the organization’s remote
access policies, processes, and procedures are being followed properly. Assessment activities may be
passive, such as reviewing logs, or active, such as performing vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
More information on technical assessments for telework and remote access is available from NIST SP
800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment.

5.5     Disposal

Before a telework client device or remote access server permanently leaves an organization (such as when
a leased server’s lease expires or when an obsolete PC is being recycled), the organization should remove
any sensitive data from the host. Data may also need to be wiped if an organization provides “loaner”
devices to teleworkers, particularly for travel. The task of scrubbing all sensitive data from storage
devices such as hard drives and memory cards is often surprisingly difficult because of all the places
where such data resides. See NIST SP 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for additional
information and recommendations on removing data from telework and remote access devices. Note that
sensitive data is often found in places other than just the user’s data area; for example, software that runs
under Microsoft Windows often stores possibly-sensitive data in the Windows registry. An organization
should strongly consider erasing all storage devices completely.

5.6     Summary of Key Recommendations

The following list presents some of the key recommendations from this section of the document.

 A telework security policy should define which forms of remote access the organization permits,
  which types of telework devices are permitted to use each form of remote access, the type of access
  each type of teleworker is granted, and how user account provisioning should be handled. It should
  also cover how the organization's remote access servers are administered and how policies in those
  servers are updated. The telework security policy should be documented in the system security plan.

  management, logging, performance, implementation security, and interference with applications.
  (Section 5.3)
 Organizations should regularly perform operational processes to maintain telework and remote access
  security, such as deploying updates, verifying clock synchronization, reconfiguring access control
  features as needed, and detecting and documenting anomalies within the remote access infrastructure.
  (Section 5.4)
 Organizations should also periodically perform assessments to confirm that the organization’s remote
  access policies, processes, and procedures are being followed properly. (Section 5.4)
 Before disposing of a telework client device or remote access server, the organization should remove
  any sensitive data from it. (Section 5.5)
